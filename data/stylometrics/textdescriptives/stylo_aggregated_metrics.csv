"and the symmetry of the gardens, rather than by the desire quite unknown to her to spare her plum-coloured skirt the spots of mud under which it would disappear up to a height that was for her maid always a source of despair and a problem. When these garden walks of my grandmother's took place after dinner, one thing had the power to make her come back in: this was at one of the times when her circular itinerary brought her back periodically, like an insect, in front of the lights of the little drawing-room where the liqueurs were set out on the card table if my great-aunt called out to her: 'Bathilde! Come and stop your husband from drinking cognac!' To tease her, in fact (she had brought into my father's family so different a mentality that everyone poked fun at her and tormented her), since liqueurs were forbidden to my grandfather, my great-aunt would make him drink a few drops. My poor grandmother would come in, ardently beg her husband not to taste the cognac; he would become angry, drink his mouthful despite her, and my grandmother would go off again, sad, discouraged, yet smiling, for she was so humble at heart and so gentle that her tenderness for others and the little fuss she made over her own person and her sufferings came together in her gaze in a smile in which, unlike what one sees in the faces of so many people, there was irony only for herself, and for all of us a sort of kiss from her eyes which could not see those she cherished without caressing them passionately with her gaze. This torture my great-aunt inflicted on her, the spectacle of my grandmother's vain entreaties and of her weakness, defeated in advance, trying uselessly to take the liqueur glass away from my grandfather, were the kinds of things to the sight of which you later become so accustomed that you smile as you contemplate them and take the part of the persecutor resolutely and gaily enough to persuade yourself privately that no persecution is involved; at that time they filled me with such horror that I would have liked to hit my great-aunt. But as soon as I heard: 'Bathilde, come and stop your husband from drinking cognac!', already a man in my cowardice, I did what we all do, once we are grown up, when confronted with sufferings and injustices: I did not want to see them; I went up to sob at the very top of the house next to the schoolroom, under the roofs, in a little room that smelled of orris-root and that was also perfumed by a wild blackcurrant bush which had sprouted outside between the stones of the wall and extended a branch of flowers through the half-open window. Intended for a more specialized and more vulgar use, this room, from which during the day you could see all the way to the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, for a long time served me as a refuge, no doubt because it was the only one I was permitted to lock, for all those occupations of mine that demanded an inviolable solitude: reading, reverie, tears and sensuous pleasure. Alas! I did not know that, much more than her husband's little deviations from his regimen, it was my weak will, my delicate health, the uncertainty they cast on my future that so sadly preoccupied my grandmother in the course of those incessant perambulations, afternoon and evening, when we would see as it passed and then passed again, lifted slantwise towards the sky, her beautiful face with its brown furrowed cheeks, which with age had become almost mauve like the ploughed fields in autumn, crossed, if she was going out, by a veil half raised, while upon them, brought there by the cold or some sad thought, an involuntary tear was always drying. My sole consolation, when I went upstairs for the night, was that Mama would come and kiss me once I was in bed. But this goodnight lasted so short a time, she went back down so soon, that the moment when I heard her coming up, then, passing along the hallway with its double doors, the soft sound of her garden dress of blue muslin, hung with little cords of plaited straw, was for me a painful moment. It announced the moment that would follow it, in which she had left me, in which she had gone back down. So that I came to wish this goodnight I loved so much would take place as late as possible, so as to prolong the time of respite in which Mama had not yet come. Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I wanted to call her back, to say 'kiss me one more time,' but I knew that immediately her face would look vexed, because the concession she was making to my sadness and agitation by coming up to kiss me, by bringing me this kiss of peace, irritated my father, who found these rituals absurd, and she would have liked to try to induce me to lose the need for it, the habit of it, far indeed from allowing me to acquire that of asking her, when she was already on the doorstep, for one kiss more. And to see her vexed destroyed all the calm she had brought me a moment before, when she had bent her loving face down over my bed and held it out to me like a host for a communion of peace from which my lips would draw her real presence and the power to fall asleep. But those evenings, when Mama stayed so short a time altogether in my room, were still sweet compared to the ones when there were people for dinner and when, because of that, she did not come up to say goodnight to me. These people were usually limited to M. Swann, who, apart from a few acquaintances passing through, was almost the only person who came to our house at Combray, sometimes for a neighbourly dinner (more rarely after that unfortunate marriage of his, because my parents did not want to receive his wife), sometimes after dinner, unexpectedly. The evenings when, sitting in front of the house under the large chestnut tree, around the iron table, we heard at the far end of the garden, not the copious high-pitched bell that drenched, that deafened in passing with its ferruginous, icy, inexhaustible noise any person in the household who set it off by coming in 'without ringing', but the shy, oval, golden double tinkling of the little visitors' bell, everyone would immediately wonder: 'A visitor now who can that be?' but we knew very well it could only be M. Swann; my great-aunt speaking loudly, to set an example, in a tone of voice that she strained to make natural, said not to whisper that way; that nothing is more disagreeable for a visitor just coming in who is led to think that people are saying things he should not hear; and they would send as a scout my grandmother, who was always glad to have a pretext for taking one more walk around the garden and who would profit from it by surreptitiously pulling up a few rose stakes on the way in order to restore a little naturalness to the roses, like a mother who runs her hand through her son's hair to fluff it up after the barber has flattened it too much. We would all remain hanging on the news my grandmother was going to bring us of the enemy, as though there had been a great number of possible assailants to choose among, and soon afterwards my grandfather would say: 'I recognize Swann's voice.' In fact one could recognize him only by his voice, it was difficult to make out his face with its aquiline nose, its green eyes, under a high forehead framed by blond, almost red hair, cut Bressant-style,2 because we kept as little light as possible in the garden so as not to attract mosquitoes, and I would go off, as though not for that purpose, to say that the cordials should be brought out; my grandmother placed a great deal of importance, considering it more amiable, on the idea that they should not seem anything exceptional, and for visitors only. M. Swann, though much younger than he, was very attached to my grandfather, who had been one of the closest friends of his father, an excellent man but peculiar, in whom, apparently, a trifle was sometimes enough to interrupt the ardour of his feelings, change the course of his thinking. Several times a year I would hear my grandfather at the table telling anecdotes, always the same ones, about the behaviour of old M. Swann upon the death of his wife, over whom he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him for a long time, had rushed to his side at the estate the Swanns owned in the vicinity of Combray and, so that he would not be present at the coffining, managed to entice him for a while, all in tears, out of the death chamber. They walked a short way in the park, where there was a little sun. Suddenly M. Swann, taking my grandfather by the arm, cried out: 'Oh, my old friend, what a joy it is to be walking here together in such fine weather! Don't you think it's pretty, all these trees, these hawthorns! And my pond which you've never congratulated me on! You're looking as sad as an old dishcloth. Feel that little breeze? Oh, say what you like, life has something to offer despite everything, my dear Amedee!' Suddenly the memory of his dead wife came back to him and, no doubt feeling it would be too complicated to try to understand how he could have yielded to an impulse of happiness at such a time, he confined himself, in a gesture habitual to him whenever a difficult question came into his mind, to passing his hand over his forehead, wiping his eyes and the lenses of his lorgnon. Yet he could not be consoled for the death of his wife, but, during the two years he survived her, would say to my grandfather: 'It's odd, I think of my poor wife often, but I can't think of her for long at a time.' 'Often, but only a little at a time, like poor old Swann,' had become one of my grandfather's favourite phrases, which he uttered apropos of the most different sorts of things. I would have thought this father of Swann's was a monster, if my grandfather, whom I considered a",3.7449132104618172,1.234395713462651,0.41632069022031043,0.05761356615173488,4.253583241455347,4.0,2.3232860464081253,51.82857142857143,47.0,36.58062384400144,1.2513781697905182,1.0,0.6010701383635461,1814,648,0.3572216097023153,7996,35,63.1817513811404,2.750970807529757e+27,1.3251304467869735e+24,0.7978047982734793,0.7782479258197726,48.36240683572218,19.389405260670973,13.348371206891418,23.20110883603717,24.5186627815404,8.6399558985667,67.81534099858246,8.285714285714286,True,1124.0,0.8805394990366089,3.851637764932563,2076.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017149857084524295,0.01347488770926909,0.00898325847284606,0.00898325847284606,0.00898325847284606,0.0,0.008574928542262147,0.004593711719069008,0.006635361371988567,0.004335260115606936,2,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"confused evocations never lasted for more than a few seconds; often, in my brief uncertainty about where I was, I did not distinguish the various suppositions of which it was composed, any better than we isolate, when we see a horse run, the successive positions shown to us by a kinetoscope. But I had seen sometimes one, sometimes another, of the bedrooms I had inhabited in my life, and in the end I would recall them all in the long reveries that followed my waking: winter bedrooms in which, as soon as you are in bed, you bury your head in a nest that you weave of the most disparate things: a corner of the pillow, the top of the covers, a bit of shawl, the side of the bed and an issue of the Debats roses,1 that you end by cementing together using the birds' technique of pressing down on it indefinitely; where in icy weather the pleasure you enjoy is the feeling that you are separated from the outdoors (like the sea swallow which makes its nest deep in an underground passage in the warmth of the earth) and where, since the fire is kept burning all night in the fireplace, you sleep in a great cloak of warm, smoky air, pierced by the glimmers from the logs breaking into flame again, a sort of immaterial alcove, a warm cave hollowed in the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat with moving thermal contours, aerated by draughts that cool your face and come from the corners, from the parts close to the window or far from the hearth, and that have grown cold again; summer bedrooms where you love becoming one with the soft night, where the moonlight leaning against the half-open shutters casts its enchanted ladder to the foot of the bed, where you sleep almost in the open air, like a titmouse rocked by the breeze on the tip of a ray of light; sometimes the Louis XVI bedroom, so gay that even the first night I had not been too unhappy there and where the slender columns that lightly supported the ceiling stood aside with such grace to show and reserve the place where the bed was; sometimes, on the other hand, the small bedroom with the very high ceiling, hollowed out in the form of a pyramid two storyes high and partly panelled in mahogany, where from the first second I had been mentally poisoned by the unfamiliar odour of the vetiver, convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and the insolent indifference of the clock chattering loudly as though I were not there; where a strange and pitiless quadrangular cheval-glass, barring obliquely one of the corners of the room, carved from deep inside the soft fullness of my usual field of vision a site for itself which I had not expected; where my mind, struggling for hours to dislodge itself, to stretch upwards so as to take the exact shape of the room and succeed in filling its gigantic funnel to the very top, had suffered many hard nights, while I lay at full length in my bed, my eyes lifted, my ear anxious, my nostril restive, my heart pounding, until habit had changed the colour of the curtains, silenced the clock, taught pity to the cruel oblique mirror, concealed, if not driven out completely, the smell of the vetiver and appreciably diminished the apparent height of the ceiling. Habit! that skilful but very slow housekeeper who begins by letting our mind suffer for weeks in a temporary arrangement; but whom we are nevertheless very happy to find, for without habit and reduced to no more than its own resources, our mind would be powerless to make a lodging habitable. Certainly I was now wide awake, my body had veered around one last time and the good angel of certainty had brought everything around me to a standstill, had laid me down under my covers, in my bedroom, and had put approximately where they belonged in the darkness my chest of drawers, my desk, my fireplace, the window on to the street and the two doors. But even though I knew I was not in any of the houses of which the ignorance of the waking moment had instantly, if not presented me with the distinct picture, at least made me believe the presence possible, my memory had been stirred; generally I would not try to go back to sleep right away; I would spend the greater part of the night remembering our life in the old days, in Combray at my great-aunt's house, in Balbec, in Paris, in Doncieres, in Venice, elsewhere still, remembering the places, the people I had known there, what I had seen of them, what I had been told about them. At Combray, every day beginning in the late afternoon, long before the moment when I would have to go to bed and stay there, without sleeping, far away from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom again became the fixed and painful focus of my preoccupations. They had indeed hit upon the idea, to distract me on the evenings when they found me looking too unhappy, of giving me a magic lantern, which, while awaiting the dinner hour, they would set on top of my lamp; and, after the fashion of the first architects and master glaziers of the Gothic age, it replaced the opacity of the walls with impalpable iridescences, supernatural multicoloured apparitions, where legends were depicted as in a wavering, momentary stained-glass window. But my sadness was only increased by this, because the mere change in lighting destroyed the familiarity my bedroom had acquired for me and which, except for the torment of going to bed, had made it tolerable to me. Now I no longer recognized it and I was uneasy there, as in a room in some hotel or 'chalet' to which I had come for the first time straight from the railway train. Moving at the jerky pace of his horse, Golo, filled with a hideous design, came out of the small triangular forest that velveted the hillside with dark green and advanced jolting towards the castle of poor Genevieve de Brabant. This castle was cut off along a curved line that was in fact the edge of one of the glass ovals arranged in the frame that you slipped between the grooves of the lantern. It was only a section of castle and it had a moor in front of it where Genevieve stood dreaming, wearing a blue belt. The castle and the moor were yellow, and I had not had to wait to see them to find out their colour since, before the glasses of the frame did so, the bronze sonority of the name Brabant had shown it to me clearly. Golo stopped for a moment to listen sadly to the patter read out loud by my great-aunt, which he seemed to understand perfectly, conforming his posture, with a meekness that did not exclude a certain majesty, to the directions of the text; then he moved off at the same jerky pace. And nothing could stop his slow ride. If the lantern was moved, I could make out Golo's horse continuing to advance over the window curtains, swelling out with their folds, descending into their fissures. The body of Golo himself, in its essence as supernatural as that of his mount, accommodated every material obstacle, every hindersome object that he encountered by taking it as his skeleton and absorbing it into himself, even the doorknob he immediately adapted to and floated invincibly over with his red robe or his pale face as noble and as melancholy as ever, but revealing no disturbance at this transvertebration. Certainly I found some charm in these brilliant projections, which seemed to emanate from a Merovingian past and send out around me such ancient reflections of history. But I cannot express the uneasiness caused in me by this intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room I had at last filled with my self to the point of paying no more attention to the room than to that self. The anaesthetizing influence of habit having ceased, I would begin to have thoughts, and feelings, and they are such sad things. That doorknob of my room, which differed for me from all other doorknobs in the world in that it seemed to open of its own accord, without my having to turn it, so unconscious had its handling become for me, was now serving as an astral body for Golo. And as soon as they rang for dinner, I hastened to run to the dining-room where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard, and well acquainted with my family and beef casserole, shed the same light as on every other evening; and to fall into the arms of Mama, whom Genevieve de Brabant's misfortunes made all the dearer to me, while Golo's crimes drove me to examine my own conscience more scrupulously. After dinner, alas, I soon had to leave Mama, who stayed there talking with the others, in the garden if the weather was fine, in the little drawing-room to which everyone withdrew if the weather was bad. Everyone, except my grandmother, who felt that 'it's a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country' and who had endless arguments with my father on days when it rained too heavily, because he sent me to read in my room instead of having me stay outdoors. 'That's no way to make him strong and active,' she would say sadly, 'especially that boy, who so needs to build up his endurance and will-power.' My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he liked meteorology, while my mother, making no noise so as not to disturb him, watched him with a tender respect, but not so intently as to try to penetrate the mystery of his superior qualities. But as for my grandmother, in all weathers, even in a downpour when Francoise had rushed the precious wicker armchairs indoors for fear they would get wet, we would see her in the empty, rain-lashed garden, pushing back her disordered grey locks so that her forehead could more freely drink in the salubriousness of the wind and rain. She would say: 'At last, one can breathe!' and would roam the soaked paths too symmetrically aligned for her liking by the new gardener, who lacked all feeling for nature and whom my father had been asking since morning if the weather would clear with her jerky, enthusiastic little step, regulated by the various emotions excited in her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the power of good health, the stupidity of my upbringing",3.8197019437260744,1.762783141890828,0.43564755285776885,0.06485441160920323,4.397018221976809,4.0,2.410810355476152,60.36666666666667,44.5,90.10345288734624,1.2998343456653783,1.0,0.655516433627962,1811,745,0.41137493097736055,8191,30,66.35678718998216,6.582434002609676e+28,3.2377934100391916e+25,0.8072530449978237,0.8056051135063171,35.59684769004235,23.29104527885146,14.018339688793702,26.554176329836185,29.4632891588441,9.564130314743235,79.58256948279036,11.6,True,1075.0,0.8937530742744713,4.0290211510083624,2033.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0198178360524472,0.003302972675407867,0.0,0.0073782587309394985,1,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"better judge and whose pronouncement, forming a legal precedent for me, often served me later to dismiss offences I might have been inclined to condemn, had not exclaimed: 'What! He had a heart of gold!' For many years, even though, especially before his marriage, the younger M. Swann often came to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and my grandparents did not suspect that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society his family had frequented and that, under the sort of incognito which this name Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring with the perfect innocence of honest innkeepers who have under their roof, without knowing it, some celebrated highwayman one of the most elegant members of the Jockey Club,3 a favourite friend of the Comte de Paris4 and the Prince of Wales,5 one of the men most sought after by the high society of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Our ignorance of this brilliant social life that Swann led was obviously due in part to the reserve and discretion of his character, but also to the fact that bourgeois people in those days formed for themselves a rather Hindu notion of society and considered it to be made up of closed castes, in which each person, from birth, found himself placed in the station which his family occupied and from which nothing, except the accidents of an exceptional career or an unhoped-for marriage, could draw him in order to make him enter a higher caste. M. Swann, the father, was a stockbroker; 'Swann the son' would find he belonged for his entire life to a caste in which fortunes varied, as in a tax bracket, between such and such fixed incomes. One knew which had been his father's associations, one therefore knew which were his own, with which people he was 'in a position' to consort. If he knew others, these were bachelor acquaintances on whom old friends of the family, as were my relatives, would close their eyes all the more benignly because he continued, after losing his parents, to come faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that these people whom he saw, who were unknown to us, were the sort he would not have dared greet had he encountered them when he was with us. If you were determined to assign Swann a social coefficient that was personal to him, among the other sons of stockbrokers in a position equal to that of his parents, this coefficient would have been a little lower for him because, very simple in his manner and having always had a 'craze' for antiques and for painting, he now lived and amassed his collections in an old townhouse which my grandmother dreamed of visiting, but which was situated on the quai d'Orleans, a part of town where my great-aunt felt it was ignominious to live. 'But are you a connoisseur? I ask for your own sake, because you're likely to let the dealers unload some awful daubs on you,' my great-aunt would say to him; in fact she did not assume he had any competence and even from an intellectual point of view had no very high opinion of a man who in conversation avoided serious subjects and showed a very prosaic preciseness not only when he gave us cooking recipes, entering into the smallest details, but even when my grandmother's sisters talked about artistic subjects. Challenged by them to give his opinion, to express his admiration for a painting, he maintained an almost ungracious silence and, on the other hand, redeemed himself if he could provide about the museum in which it was to be found, about the date at which it had been painted, a material piece of information. But usually he would content himself with trying to entertain us by telling a new story each time about something that had just happened to him involving people selected from among those we knew, the Combray pharmacist, our cook, our coachman. Certainly these tales made my great-aunt laugh, but she could not distinguish clearly if this was because of the absurd role Swann always assigned himself or because of the wit he put into telling them: 'You are quite a character, Monsieur Swann!' Being the only rather vulgar person in our family, she took care to point out to strangers, when they were talking about Swann, that, had he wanted to, he could have lived on the boulevard Haussmann or the avenue de l'Opera, that he was the son of M. Swann, who must have left four or five million, but that this was his whim. A whim that she felt moreover must be so amusing to others that in Paris, when M. Swann came on New Year's Day to bring her her bag of marrons glaces, she never failed, if there was company, to say to him: 'Well, Monsieur Swann! Do you still live next-door to the wine depot, so as to be sure of not missing the train when you go to Lyon?' And she would look out of the corner of her eye, over her lorgnon, at the other visitors. But if anyone had told my great-aunt that this Swann, who, as the son of old M. Swann, was perfectly 'qualified' to be received by all the 'best of the bourgeoisie', by the most respected notaries or lawyers of Paris (a hereditary privilege he seemed somewhat inclined to let lapse), had, as though in secret, quite a different life; that on leaving our house, in Paris, after telling us he was going home to bed, he retraced his steps as soon as he had turned the corner and went to a certain drawing-room that no eye of any broker or broker's associate would ever contemplate, this would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as might to a better-educated lady the thought of being personally on close terms with Aristaeus and learning that, after having a chat with her, he would go deep into the heart of the realms of Thetis, into an empire hidden from the eyes of mortals, where Virgil shows us him being received with open arms; or to confine oneself to an image that had more chance of occurring to her, for she had seen it painted on our petits-fours plates at Combray of having had as a dinner guest Ali Baba, who, as soon as he knows he is alone, will enter the cave dazzling with unsuspected treasure. One day when he had come to see us in Paris after dinner apologizing for being in evening clothes, Francoise having said, after he left, that she had learned from the coachman that he had dined 'at the home of a princess,' 'Yes, a princess of the demi-monde!' my aunt had responded shrugging her shoulders without raising her eyes from her knitting, with serene irony. Thus, my great-aunt was cavalier in her treatment of him. Since she believed he must be flattered by our invitations, she found it quite natural that he never came to see us in the summertime without having in his hand a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden and that from each of his trips to Italy he would bring me back photographs of masterpieces. They did not hesitate to send him in search of it when they needed a recipe for gribiche sauce or pineapple salad for large dinners to which they had not invited him, believing he did not have sufficient prestige for one to be able to serve him up to acquaintances who were coming for the first time. If the conversation turned on the princes of the House of France: 'people you and I will never know, will we, and we can manage quite well without that, can't we,' my great-aunt would say to Swann, who perhaps had a letter from Twickenham6 in his pocket; she had him push the piano around and turn the pages on the evenings when my grandmother's sister sang, handling this creature, who was elsewhere so sought-after, with the naive roughness of a child who plays with a collector's trinket no more carefully than with some cheap object. No doubt the Swann who was known at the same period to so many clubmen was quite different from the one created by my great-aunt, when in the evening, in the little garden at Combray, after the two hesitant rings of the bell had sounded, she injected and invigorated with all that she knew about the Swann family the dark and uncertain figure who emerged, followed by my grandmother, from a background of shadows, and whom we recognized by his voice. But even with respect to the most insignificant things in life, none of us constitutes a material whole, identical for everyone, which a person has only to go to look up as though we were a book of specifications or a last testament; our social personality is a creation of the minds of others. Even the very simple act that we call 'seeing a person we know' is in part an intellectual act. We fill the physical appearance of the individual we see with all the notions we have about him, and in the total picture that we form for ourselves, these notions certainly have the greater part. In the end they swell his cheeks so perfectly, follow the line of his nose in an adherence so exact, they do so well at nuancing the sonority of his voice as though the latter were only a transparent envelope that each time we see this face and hear this voice, it is these notions that we encounter again, that we hear. No doubt, in the Swann they had formed for themselves, my family had failed out of ignorance to include a host of details from his life in the fashionable world that caused other people, when they were in his presence, to see refinements rule his face and stop at his aquiline nose as though at their natural frontier; but they had also been able to garner in this face disaffected of its prestige, vacant and spacious, in the depths of these depreciated eyes, the vague, sweet residue half memory, half forgetfulness of the idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, around the card table or in the garden, during our life of good country neighbourliness. The corporeal envelope of our friend had been so well stuffed with all this, as well as with a few memories relating to his parents, that this particular Swann had become a complete and living being, and I have the impression of leaving one person to go to another distinct from him, when, in my memory, I pass from the Swann I knew later with accuracy to",3.7912841645711604,0.9413577849740489,0.44538274647854803,0.04091389671997444,4.358126721763085,4.0,2.378185713885003,58.54838709677419,54.0,43.7779136460955,1.2986225895316805,1.0,0.643743595105244,1815,663,0.3652892561983471,8166,31,58.57307610582387,2.741345288116776e+25,1.3392014109021865e+22,0.8569602310657501,0.835176247974922,37.54491602239405,22.567617524215766,14.508428754510337,26.130098640362572,28.370970407891228,9.32022038567493,76.23433750999733,10.35483870967742,True,1135.0,0.8915486077186126,3.9892525647288717,2047.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008830022075055188,0.005819787276740919,0.005819787276740919,0.005819787276740919,0.005819787276740919,0.0,0.010234798314268514,0.007224563515954244,0.01043548063415613,0.006839276990718124,3,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"The Way by Swann's For Monsieur Gaston Calmette As a token of profound and affectionate gratitude. Marcel Proust PART I: Combray For a long time, I went to bed early. Sometimes, my candle scarcely out, my eyes would close so quickly that I did not have time to say to myself: 'I'm falling asleep.' And, half an hour later, the thought that it was time to try to sleep would wake me; I wanted to put down the book I thought I still had in my hands and blow out my light; I had not ceased while sleeping to form reflections on what I had just read, but these reflections had taken a rather peculiar turn; it seemed to me that I myself was what the book was talking about: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Francois I and Charles V. This belief lived on for a few seconds after my waking; it did not shock my reason but lay heavy like scales on my eyes and kept them from realizing that the candlestick was no longer lit. Then it began to grow unintelligible to me, as after metempsychosis do the thoughts of an earlier existence; the subject of the book detached itself from me, I was free to apply myself to it or not; immediately I recovered my sight and I was amazed to find a darkness around me soft and restful for my eyes, but perhaps even more so for my mind, to which it appeared a thing without cause, incomprehensible, a thing truly dark. I would ask myself what time it might be; I could hear the whistling of the trains which, remote or near by, like the singing of a bird in a forest, plotting the distances, described to me the extent of the deserted countryside where the traveller hastens towards the nearest station; and the little road he is following will be engraved on his memory by the excitement he owes to new places, to unaccustomed activities, to the recent conversation and the farewells under the unfamiliar lamp that follow him still through the silence of the night, to the imminent sweetness of his return. I would rest my cheeks tenderly against the lovely cheeks of the pillow, which, full and fresh, are like the cheeks of our childhood. I would strike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. This is the hour when the sick man who has been obliged to go off on a journey and has had to sleep in an unfamiliar hotel, wakened by an attack, is cheered to see a ray of light under the door. How fortunate, it's already morning! In a moment the servants will be up, he will be able to ring, someone will come to help him. The hope of being relieved gives him the courage to suffer. In fact he thought he heard footsteps; the steps approach, then recede. And the ray of light that was under his door has disappeared. It is midnight; they have just turned off the gas; the last servant has gone and he will have to suffer the whole night through without remedy. I would go back to sleep, and sometimes afterwards woke only briefly for a moment, long enough to hear the organic creak of the woodwork, open my eyes and stare at the kaleidoscope of the darkness, savour in a momentary glimmer of consciousness the sleep into which were plunged the furniture, the room, that whole of which I was only a small part and whose insensibility I would soon return to share. Or else while sleeping I had effortlessly returned to a for ever vanished period of my early life, rediscovered one of my childish terrors such as that my great-uncle would pull me by my curls, a terror dispelled on the day the dawn for me of a new era when they were cut off. I had forgotten that event during my sleep, I recovered its memory as soon as I managed to wake myself up to escape the hands of my great-uncle, but as a precautionary measure I would completely surround my head with my pillow before returning to the world of dreams. Sometimes, as Eve was born from one of Adam's ribs, a woman was born during my sleep from a cramped position of my thigh. Formed of the pleasure I was on the point of enjoying, she, I imagined, was the one offering it to me. My body, which felt in hers my own warmth, tried to return to itself inside her, I woke up. The rest of humanity seemed very remote compared with this woman I had left scarcely a few moments before; my cheek was still warm from her kiss, my body aching from the weight of hers. If, as sometimes happened, she had the features of a woman I had known in life, I would devote myself entirely to this end: to finding her again, like those who go off on a journey to see a longed-for city with their own eyes and imagine that one can enjoy in reality the charm of a dream. Little by little the memory of her would fade, I had forgotten the girl of my dream. A sleeping man holds in a circle around him the sequence of the hours, the order of the years and worlds. He consults them instinctively as he wakes and reads in them in a second the point on the earth he occupies, the time that has elapsed up to his waking; but their ranks can be mixed up, broken. If towards morning, after a bout of insomnia, sleep overcomes him as he is reading, in a position too different from the one in which he usually sleeps, his raised arm alone is enough to stop the sun and make it retreat, and, in the first minute of his waking, he will no longer know what time it is, he will think he has only just gone to bed. If he dozes off in a position still more displaced and divergent, for instance after dinner sitting in an armchair, then the confusion among the disordered worlds will be complete, the magic armchair will send him travelling at top speed through time and space, and, at the moment of opening his eyelids, he will believe he went to bed several months earlier in another country. But it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was deep and allowed my mind to relax entirely; then it would let go of the map of the place where I had fallen asleep and, when I woke in the middle of the night, since I did not know where I was, I did not even understand in the first moment who I was; all I had, in its original simplicity, was the sense of existence as it may quiver in the depths of an animal; I was more bereft than a caveman; but then the memory not yet of the place where I was, but of several of those where I had lived and where I might have been would come to me like help from on high to pull me out of the void from which I could not have got out on my own; I passed over centuries of civilization in one second, and the image confusedly glimpsed of oil lamps, then of wing-collar shirts, gradually recomposed my self's original features. Perhaps the immobility of the things around us is imposed on them by our certainty that they are themselves and not others, by the immobility of our mind confronting them. However that may be, when I woke thus, my mind restlessly attempting, without success, to discover where I was, everything revolved around me in the darkness, things, countries, years. My body, too benumbed to move, would try to locate, according to the form of its fatigue, the position of its limbs in order to deduce from this the direction of the wall, the location of the furniture, in order to reconstruct and name the dwelling in which it found itself. Its memory, the memory of its ribs, its knees, its shoulders, offered in succession several of the rooms where it had slept, while around it the invisible walls, changing place according to the shape of the imagined room, spun through the shadows. And even before my mind, which hesitated on the thresholds of times and shapes, had identified the house by reassembling the circumstances, it my body would recall the kind of bed in each one, the location of the doors, the angle at which the light came in through the windows, the existence of a hallway, along with the thought I had had as I fell asleep and that I had recovered upon waking. My stiffened side, trying to guess its orientation, would imagine, for instance, that it lay facing the wall in a big canopied bed and immediately I would say to myself: 'Why, I went to sleep in the end even though Mama didn't come to say goodnight to me,' I was in the country at the house of my grandfather, dead for many years; and my body, the side on which I was resting, faithful guardians of a past my mind ought never to have forgotten, recalled to me the flame of the nightlight of Bohemian glass, in the shape of an urn, hanging from the ceiling by little chains, the mantelpiece of Siena marble, in my bedroom at Combray, at my grandparents' house, in remote days which at this moment I imagined were present without picturing them to myself exactly and which I would see more clearly in a little while when I was fully awake. Then the memory of a new position would be reborn; the wall would slip away in another direction: I was in my room at Mme de Saint-Loup's, in the country; good Lord! It's ten o'clock or even later, they will have finished dinner! I must have over-slept in the nap I take every evening when I come back from my walk with Mme de Saint-Loup, before putting on my evening clothes. For many years have passed since Combray, where, however late we returned, it was the sunset's red reflections I saw in the panes of my window. It is another sort of life one leads at Tansonville, at Mme de Saint-Loup's, another sort of pleasure I take in going out only at night, in following by moonlight those lanes where I used to play in the sun; and the room where I will have fallen asleep instead of dressing for dinner from far off I can see it, as we come back, pierced by the flares of the lamp, lone beacon in the night. These revolving,",3.2840522263292953,1.1992907128768768,0.4765074629719339,0.06942393500012957,4.149889380530974,4.0,2.3461958450895666,43.04761904761905,29.5,38.90951186250844,1.2483407079646018,1.0,0.6030412516360054,1808,634,0.3506637168141593,7753,42,69.37002284922164,1.3397326235651647e+30,6.564099086551517e+26,0.8170422897106264,0.8073646649718285,57.532042772861374,15.928991782553734,11.855464076750408,19.387189211967975,19.639788506110413,7.9137389380531005,58.86620311841551,6.809523809523809,True,1135.0,0.8912297893189612,3.798628123468888,2041.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022506019051606825,0.004815241285460065,0.004815241285460065,0.004815241285460065,0.0,0.0,0.014445723856380195,0.0037684497016643986,0.0037684497016643986,0.0019598236158745713,0,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"that first Swann to that first Swann in whom I rediscover the charming mistakes of my youth and who in fact resembles less the other Swann than he resembles the other people I knew at the time, as though it were the same in our life as in a museum where all the portraits from one period have a family look about them, one tonality to that first Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the smell of the tall chestnut tree, the baskets of raspberries and a sprig of tarragon. Yet one day when my grandmother had gone to ask a favour from a lady she had known at the Sacre-Coeur7 (and with whom, because of our notion of the castes, she had not wished to remain in close contact despite a reciprocal congeniality), this lady, the Marquise de Villeparisis of the famous de Bouillon8 family, had said to her: 'I believe you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephew and niece the des Laumes.' My grandmother had returned from her visit full of enthusiasm for the house, which overlooked some gardens and in which Mme de Villeparisis had advised her to rent a flat, and also for a waistcoat-maker and his daughter, who kept a shop in the courtyard into which she had gone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn in the stairwell. My grandmother had found these people wonderful, she declared that the girl was a pearl and the waistcoat-maker was the most distinguished, the finest man she had ever seen. Because for her, distinction was something absolutely independent of social position. She went into ecstasies over an answer the waistcoat-maker had given her, saying to Mama: 'Sevigne9 couldn't have said it any better!' and, in contrast, of a nephew of Mme de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house: 'Oh, my dear daughter, how common he is!' Now the remark about Swann had had the effect, not of raising him in my great-aunt's mind, but of lowering Mme de Villeparisis. It seemed that the respect which, on my grandmother's faith, we accorded Mme de Villeparisis created a duty on her part to do nothing that would make her less worthy, a duty in which she had failed by learning of Swann's existence, by permitting relatives of hers to associate with him. 'What! She knows Swann? A person you claim is a relation of the Marechal de MacMahon?'10 This opinion of my family's regarding Swann's associations seemed to them confirmed later by his marriage to a woman of the worst social station, practically a cocotte, whom, what was more, he never attempted to introduce, continuing to come to our house alone, though less and less, but from whom they believed they could judge assuming it was there that he had found her the social circle, unknown to them, that he habitually frequented. But one time, my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was one of the most faithful guests at the Sunday lunches given by the Duc de X..., whose father and uncle had been the most prominent statesmen in the reign of Louis-Philippe.11 Now my grandfather was interested in all the little facts that could help him enter imaginatively into the private lives of men like Mole, like the Duc Pasquier, like the Duc de Broglie.12 He was delighted to learn that Swann associated with people who had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this news in a sense unfavourable to Swann: anyone who chose his associations outside the caste into which he had been born, outside his social 'class', suffered in her eyes a regrettable lowering of his social position. It seemed to her that he gave up forthwith the fruit of all the good relations with well-placed people so honourably preserved and stored away for their children by foresightful families (my great aunt had even stopped seeing the son of a lawyer we knew because he had married royalty and was therefore in her opinion demoted from the respected rank of lawyer's son to that of one of those adventurers, former valets or stableboys, on whom they say that queens sometimes bestowed their favours). She disapproved of my grandfather's plan to question Swann, the next evening he was to come to dinner, about these friends of his we had discovered. At the same time my grandmother's two sisters, old maids who shared her nobility of character, but not her sort of mind, declared that they could not understand what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about such foolishness. They were persons of lofty aspirations, who for that very reason were incapable of taking an interest in what is known as tittle-tattle, even if it had some historic interest, and more generally in anything that was not directly connected to an aesthetic or moral object. The disinterestedness of their minds was such, with respect to all that, closely or distantly, seemed connected with worldly life, that their sense of hearing having finally understood its temporary uselessness when the conversation at dinner assumed a tone that was frivolous or merely pedestrian without these two old spinsters being able to lead it back to the subjects dear to them would suspend the functioning of its receptive organs and allow them to undergo a true beginning of atrophy. If my grandfather needed to attract the two sisters' attention at such times, he had to resort to those bodily signals used by alienists with certain lunatics suffering from distraction: striking a glass repeatedly with the blade of a knife, while speaking to them sharply and looking them suddenly in the eye, violent methods which these psychiatrists often bring with them into their ordinary relations with healthy people, either from professional habit or because they believe everyone is a little crazy. They were more interested when, the day before Swann was to come to dinner, and had personally sent them a case of Asti wine, my aunt, holding a copy of the Figaro in which next to the title of a painting in an exhibition of Corot, these words appeared: 'From the collection of M. Charles Swann,' said to us: 'Did you see this? Swann is ""front page news"" in the Figaro. But I've always told you he had a great deal of taste, said my grandmother. Of course you would! Anything so long as your opinion is not the same as ours,' answered my great-aunt, who, knowing that my grandmother was never of the same opinion as she, and not being quite sure that she herself was the one we always declared was right, wanted to extract from us a general condemnation of my grandmother's convictions against which she was trying to force us into solidarity with her own. But we remained silent. When my grandmother's sisters expressed their intention of speaking to Swann about this mention in the Figaro, my great-aunt advised them against it. Each time she saw in others an advantage, however small, that she did not have, she persuaded herself that it was not an advantage but a detriment and she pitied them so as not to have to envy them. 'I believe you would not be pleasing him at all; I am quite sure I would find it very unpleasant to see my name printed boldly like that in the newspaper, and I would not be at all gratified if someone spoke to me about it.' But she did not persist in trying to convince my grandmother's sisters; for they in their horror of vulgarity had made such a fine art of concealing a personal allusion beneath ingenious circumlocutions that it often went unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed. As for my mother, she thought only of trying to persuade my father to agree to talk to Swann not about his wife but about his daughter, whom he adored and because of whom it was said he had finally entered into this marriage. 'You might just say a word to him; just ask how she is. It must be so hard for him.' But my father would become annoyed: 'No, no; you have the most absurd ideas. It would be ridiculous.' But the only one of us for whom Swann's arrival became the object of a painful preoccupation was I. This was because on the evenings when outsiders, or merely M. Swann, were present, Mama did not come up to my room. I had dinner before everyone else and afterwards I came and sat at the table, until eight o'clock when it was understood that I had to go upstairs; the precious and fragile kiss that Mama usually entrusted to me in my bed at the moment I was going to sleep I would have to convey from the dining-room to my bedroom and protect during the whole time I undressed, so that its sweetness would not shatter, so that its volatile essence would not spread and evaporate and, on precisely those evenings when I needed to receive it with more care, I had to take it, I had to snatch it brusquely, publicly, without even having the time and the freedom of mind necessary to bring to what I was doing the attention of those possessed by some mania who do their utmost not to think of anything else while they are shutting a door, so as to be able, when the morbid uncertainty returns to them, to confront it victoriously with the memory of the moment when they did shut the door. We were all in the garden when the two hesitant rings of the little bell sounded. We knew it was Swann; even so we all looked at one another questioningly and my grandmother was sent on reconnaissance. 'Remember to thank him intelligibly for the wine, you know how delicious it is and the case is enormous,' my grandfather exhorted his two sisters-in-law. 'Don't start whispering, said my great-aunt. How comfortable would you feel arriving at a house where everyone is speaking so quietly! Ah! Here's M. Swann. Let's ask him if he thinks the weather will be good tomorrow,' said my father. My mother thought that one word from her would wipe out all the affliction that we in our family might have caused Swann since his marriage. She found an opportunity to take him aside. But I followed her; I could not bring myself to part from her by even one step, thinking that very soon I would have to leave her in the dining-room and that I would have to go up to my room without having the consolation I had on the other evenings that she would come kiss me. 'Now, M. Swann, she said to him,",3.165184876587722,1.3967001539417712,0.42924522725016123,0.08444887706442224,4.403962575674188,4.0,2.505414221935285,35.627450980392155,24.0,34.36137867552598,1.32526141992295,1.0,0.6712798792557662,1817,643,0.3538800220143093,8278,51,59.937474227648124,1.0727890111702069e+26,5.222926052435282e+22,0.71847042709589,0.6784254531471097,58.556021129420415,13.942790637443753,12.695044712117777,17.399026622206396,17.1263892216215,9.264479911942761,54.50472120603882,6.7254901960784315,True,1133.0,0.8938656280428432,4.0301850048685495,2054.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004365945624131772,0.004365945624131772,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005953562214725144,0.004961301845604287,0.005159753919428458,0.007302823758519961,4,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to stop up all the exits, close the shutters, dig my own grave by undoing my covers, put on the shroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which they had added to the room because I was too hot in the summer under the rep curtains of the big bed, I had a fit of rebelliousness, I wanted to attempt the ruse of a condemned man. I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for something serious that I could not tell her in my letter. My fear was that Francoise, my aunt's cook who was charged with looking after me when I was at Combray, would refuse to take my note. I suspected that, for her, delivering a message to my mother when there was company would seem as impossible as for a theatre porter to hand a letter to an actor while he was on stage. With respect to things that could or could not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, extensive, subtle and intransigent about distinctions that were impalpable or otiose (which made it resemble those ancient laws which, alongside such fierce prescriptions as the massacre of children at the breast, forbid one with an exaggerated delicacy to boil a kid in its mother's milk, or to eat the sinew from an animal's thigh). This code, to judge from her sudden obstinacy when she did not wish to do certain errands that we gave her, seemed to have anticipated social complexities and worldly refinements such that nothing in Francoise's associations or her life as a village domestic could have suggested them to her; and we had to say to ourselves that in her there was a very old French past, noble and ill understood, as in those manufacturing towns where elegant old houses testify that there was once a court life, and where the employees of a factory for chemical products work surrounded by delicate sculptures representing the miracle of Saint Theophile or the four sons of Aymon.21 In this particular case, the article of the code which made it unlikely that except in case of fire Francoise would go and bother Mama in the presence of M. Swann for so small a personage as myself simply asserted the respect she professed not only for the family as for the dead, for priests and for kings but also for the visitor to whom one was offering one's hospitality, a respect that would perhaps have touched me in a book but that always irritated me on her lips, because of the solemn and tender tones she adopted in speaking of it, and especially so this evening, when the sacred character she conferred on the dinner might have the effect of making her refuse to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself a better chance, I did not hesitate to lie and tell her that it was not in the least I who had wanted to write to Mama, but that it was Mama who, as she said goodnight to me, had exhorted me not to forget to send her an answer concerning an object she had asked me to look for; and she would certainly be very annoyed if this note was not delivered to her. I think Francoise did not believe me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much more powerful than ours, she could immediately discern, from signs imperceptible to us, any truth that we wanted to hide from her; she looked at the envelope for five minutes as if the examination of the paper and the appearance of the writing would inform her about the nature of the contents or tell her which article of her code she ought to apply. Then she went out with an air of resignation that seemed to signify: 'If it isn't a misfortune for parents to have a child like that!' She came back after a moment to tell me that they were still only at the ice cream stage, that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the letter right away in front of everyone, but that, when the mouth-rinsing bowls were put round, they would find a way to hand it to Mama. Instantly my anxiety subsided; it was now no longer, as it had been a moment ago, until tomorrow that I had left my mother, since my little note, though it would no doubt annoy her (and doubly so because this stratagem would make me ridiculous in Swann's eyes), would allow me, invisible and enraptured, at least to enter the same room, would whisper about me in her ear; since that forbidden, hostile dining-room, where, just a moment before, even the ice cream the 'granite'22 and the rinsing bowls seemed to me to contain pleasures that were noxious and mortally sad because Mama was enjoying them so far away from me, was opening itself to me and, like a fruit that has turned sweet and bursts its skin, was about to propel, to project, all the way to my intoxicated heart, Mama's attention while she read my lines. Now I was no longer separated from her; the barriers were down, an exquisite thread joined us. And that was not all: Mama would probably come! I thought that Swann would surely have laughed at the anguish I had just suffered if he had read my letter and guessed its purpose; yet, on the contrary, as I learned later, a similar anguish was the torment of long years of his life and no one, perhaps, could have understood me as well as he; in his case, the anguish that comes from the feeling that the person you love is in a place of enjoyment where you are not, where you cannot follow, came to him through love, to which it is in some sense predestined, by which it will be hoarded, appropriated; but when, as in my case, this anguish comes into us before love has made its appearance in our life, it drifts as it waits for it, indeterminate and free, without a particular assignment, at the service of one feeling one day, of another the next, sometimes of filial tenderness or affection for a friend. And the joy with which I served my first apprenticeship when Francoise came back to tell me my letter would be delivered Swann too had known well, that deceptive joy which some friend, some relative of the woman we love can give us when, arriving at the house or theatre where she is, for some dance, gala evening or premiere at which he is going to meet her, this friend sees us wandering outside, desperately waiting for some opportunity to communicate with her. He recognizes us, speaks to us familiarly, asks us what we are doing there. And when we invent the story that we have something urgent to say to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be simpler, brings us into the hall and promises to send her to us in five minutes. How we love him, as at that moment I loved Francoise the well-intentioned intermediary who with a single word has just made tolerable, human and almost propitious the unimaginable, infernal festivity into the thick of which we had been imagining that hostile, perverse and exquisite vortices of pleasure were carrying away from us and inspiring with derisive laughter the woman we love! If we are to judge by him, the relative who has come up to us and is himself also one of the initiates in the cruel mysteries, the other guests at the party cannot have anything very demoniacal about them. Those inaccessible and excruciating hours during which she was about to enjoy unknown pleasures now, through an unhoped-for breach, we are entering them; now, one of the moments which, in succession, would have composed those hours, a moment as real as the others, perhaps even more important to us, because our mistress is more involved in it, we can picture to ourselves, we possess it, we are taking part in it, we have created it almost: the moment in which he will tell her we are here, downstairs. And no doubt the other moments of the party would not have been essentially very different from this one, would not have had anything more delectable about them that should make us suffer so, since the kind friend has said to us: 'Why, she'll be delighted to come down! It'll be much nicer for her to chat with you than to be bored up there.' Alas! Swann had learned by experience that the good intentions of a third person have no power over a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even into a party by someone she does not love. Often, the friend comes back down alone. My mother did not come, and with no consideration for my pride (which was invested in her not denying the story that she was supposed to have asked me to let her know the results of some search) asked Francoise to say these words to me: 'There is no answer,' words I have so often since then heard the doormen in grand hotels or the footmen in bawdy-houses bring back to some poor girl who exclaims in surprise: 'What, he said nothing? Why, that's impossible! Did you really give him my note? All right, I'll go on waiting.' And just as she invariably assures him she does not need the extra gas-jet which the doorman wants to light for her, and remains there, hearing nothing further but the few remarks about the weather exchanged by the doorman and a lackey whom he sends off suddenly, when he notices the time, to put a customer's drink on ice having declined Francoise's offer to make me some tea or to stay with me, I let her return to the servants' hall, I went to bed and closed my eyes, trying not to hear the voices of my family, who were having their coffee in the garden. But after a few seconds, I became aware that, by writing that note to Mama, by approaching, at the risk of angering her, so close to her that I thought I could touch the moment when I would see her again, I had closed off for myself the possibility of falling asleep without seeing her again, and the beating of my heart grew more painful each minute because I was increasing my agitation by telling myself to be calm, to accept my misfortune. Suddenly my anxiety subsided, a happiness invaded me as when a powerful medicine begins to take effect and our pain vanishes: I had just formed the resolution not to continue trying to fall",3.6180069564560697,1.303474917966236,0.43293492651152843,0.0498394293019595,4.279314159292035,4.0,2.353911538189684,54.78787878787879,41.0,51.49860696895483,1.3086283185840708,1.0,0.6725436288073697,1808,652,0.3606194690265487,7982,33,61.24198918038249,3.954193900171397e+26,1.951724531180354e+23,0.801054900046438,0.776468149596645,40.51534727809067,21.219086886564764,14.202954383596115,24.658514347009927,26.11950908420488,8.822101769911502,72.32106462858675,9.606060606060606,True,1173.0,0.8998025666337611,3.9397828232971372,2026.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006133714986710284,0.0033735432426906563,0.0,0.0024679170779861796,6,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"do tell me about your daughter; I'm sure she already has a taste for beautiful things like her papa. Here, come and sit with the rest of us on the verandah,' said my grandfather coming up to them. My mother was obliged to stop, but she derived from this very constraint one more delicate thought, like good poets forced by the tyranny of rhyme to find their most beautiful lines: 'We can talk about her again when we're by ourselves, she said softly to Swann. Only a mother is capable of understanding you. I'm sure her own mother would agree with me.' We all sat down around the iron table. I would have preferred not to think about the hours of anguish I was going to spend that evening alone in my room without being able to go to sleep; I tried to persuade myself they were not at all important, since I would have forgotten them by tomorrow morning, and to fix my mind on ideas of the future that should have led me as though across a bridge beyond the imminent abyss that frightened me so. But my mind, strained by my preoccupation and as convex as the glance which I shot at my mother, would not allow itself to be penetrated by any foreign impressions. Thoughts certainly entered it, but only on condition that they left outside every element of beauty or simply of playfulness that could have moved or distracted me. As a patient, by means of an anaesthetic, can watch with complete lucidity the operation being performed on him, but without feeling anything, I could recite to myself some lines that I loved or observe the efforts my grandfather made to talk to Swann about the Duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier, without the former making me feel any emotion, the latter any hilarity. Those efforts were fruitless. Scarcely had my grandfather asked Swann a question relating to that orator than one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose ears the question was resonating like a profound but untimely silence that should be broken for the sake of politeness, would address the other: 'Just imagine, Celine, I've met a young Swedish governess who has been telling me about the cooperatives in the Scandinavian countries; the details are most interesting. We really must have her here for dinner one evening. Certainly! answered her sister Flora,13 but I haven't been wasting my time either. At M. Vinteuil's I met a learned old man who knows Maubant14 very well, and Maubant has explained to him in the greatest detail how he creates his parts. It's most interesting. He's a neighbour of M. Vinteuil's, I had no idea; and he's very nice. M. Vinteuil isn't the only one who has nice neighbours,' exclaimed my Aunt Celine in a voice which was loud because of her shyness and artificial because of her premeditation, while casting at Swann what she called a meaningful look. At the same time my Aunt Flora, who had understood that this phrase was Celine's way of thanking Swann for the Asti, was also looking at Swann with an expression that combined congratulation and irony, either simply to emphasize her sister's witticism, or because she envied Swann for having inspired it, or because she could not help making fun of him since she thought he was being put on the spot. 'I think we can manage to persuade the old gentleman to come for dinner, continued Flora; when you get him started on Maubant or Mme Materna,15 he talks for hours without stopping. That must be delightful,' sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had unfortunately just as completely failed to include the possibility of taking a passionate interest in Swedish cooperatives or the creation of Maubant's parts as it had forgotten to furnish those of my grandmother's sisters with the little grain of salt one must add oneself, in order to find some savour in it, to a story about the private life of Mole or the Comte de Paris. 'Listen, said Swann to my grandfather, what I'm going to say has more to do than it might appear with what you were asking me, because in certain respects things haven't changed enormously. This morning I was rereading something in Saint-Simon16 that would have amused you. It's in the volume about his mission to Spain;17 it's not one of the best, hardly more than a journal, but at least it's a marvellously well-written journal, which already makes it rather fundamentally different from the deadly boring journals we think we have to read every morning and evening. I don't agree, there are days when reading the papers seems to me very pleasant indeed...' my aunt Flora interrupted, to show that she had read the sentence about Swann's Corot in Le Figaro. 'When they talk about things or people that interest us!' said my aunt Celine, going one better. 'I don't deny it, answered Swann with surprise. What I fault the newspapers for is that day after day they draw our attention to insignificant things whereas only three or four times in our lives do we read a book in which there is something really essential. Since we tear the band off the newspaper so feverishly every morning, they ought to change things and put into the newspaper, oh, I don't know, perhaps... Pascal's Pensees!' (He isolated this word with an ironic emphasis so as not to seem pedantic.) 'And then, in the gilt-edged volume that we open only once in ten years,' he added, showing the disdain for worldly things affected by certain worldly men, 'we would read that the Queen of Greece has gone to Cannes or that the Princesse de Leon has given a costume ball. This way, the proper proportions would be re-established.' But, sorry he had gone so far as to speak even lightly of serious things: 'What a lofty conversation we're having, he said ironically, I don't know why we're climbing to such ""heights""' and turning to my grandfather: 'Well, Saint-Simon describes how Maulevrier18 had the audacity to offer his hand to Saint-Simon's sons. You know, this is the same Maulevrier, of whom he says: ""Never did I see in that thick bottle anything but ill-humour, vulgarity and foolishness."" Thick or not, I know some bottles in which there is something quite different,' said Flora vivaciously, determined that she too should thank Swann, because the gift of Asti was addressed to both of them. Celine laughed. Swann, disconcerted, went on: '""I cannot say whether it was ignorance or a trap,"" wrote Saint-Simon. ""He tried to give his hand to my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.""' My grandfather was already in ecstasies over 'ignorance or a trap', but Mlle Celine, in whom the name of Saint-Simon a literary man had prevented the complete anaesthesia of her auditory faculties, was already growing indignant: 'What? You admire that? Well, that's a fine thing! But what can it mean; isn't one man as good as the next? What difference can it make whether he's a duke or a coachman, if he's intelligent and good-hearted? Your Saint-Simon had a fine way of raising his children, if he didn't teach them to give their hand to all decent people. Why, it's quite abominable. And you dare to quote that?' And my grandfather, terribly upset and sensing how impossible it would be, in the face of this obstruction, to try to get Swann to tell the stories that would have amused him, said quietly to Mama: 'Now remind me of the line you taught me that comforts me so much at times like this. Oh, yes!: ""What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor!""19 Oh, how good that is!' I did not take my eyes off my mother, I knew that when we were at the table, they would not let me stay during the entire dinner and that, in order not to annoy my father, Mama would not let me kiss her several times in front of the company, as though we were in my room. And so I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they were beginning dinner and I felt the hour approaching, I would do everything I could do alone in advance of this kiss which would be so brief and furtive, choose with my eyes the place on her cheek that I would kiss, prepare my thoughts so as to be able, by means of this mental beginning of the kiss, to devote the whole of the minute Mama would grant me to feeling her cheek against my lips, as a painter who can obtain only short sittings prepares his palette and does in advance from memory, guided by his notes, everything for which he could if necessary manage without the presence of the model. But now before the dinner-bell rang my grandfather had the unwitting brutality to say: 'The boy looks tired, he ought to go up to bed. We're dining late tonight anyway.' And my father, who was not as scrupulous as my grandmother and my mother about honouring treaties, said: 'Yes, go on now, up to bed with you.' I tried to kiss Mama, at that moment we heard the dinner-bell. 'No, really, leave your mother alone, you've already said goodnight to each other as it is, these demonstrations are ridiculous. Go on now, upstairs!' And I had to leave without my viaticum; I had to climb each step of the staircase, as the popular expression has it, 'against my heart',20 climbing against my heart which wanted to go back to my mother because she had not, by kissing me, given it licence to go with me. That detested staircase which I always entered with such gloom exhaled an odour of varnish that had in some sense absorbed, fixated, the particular sort of sorrow I felt every evening and made it perhaps even crueller to my sensibility because, when it took that olfactory form, my intelligence could no longer share in it. When we are asleep and a raging toothache is as yet perceived by us only in the form of a girl whom we attempt two hundred times in a row to pull out of the water or a line by Moliere that we repeat to ourselves incessantly, it is a great relief to wake up so that our intelligence can divest the idea of raging toothache of its disguise of heroism or cadence. It was the opposite of this relief that I experienced when my sorrow at going up to my room entered me in a manner infinitely swifter, almost instantaneous, at once insidious and abrupt, through the inhalation far more toxic than the intellectual penetration of the smell of varnish peculiar to that staircase. Once in my room, I had",3.0168717240167817,1.0678418315168967,0.4183609233713884,0.09417418805005623,4.36198347107438,4.0,2.463974801701157,28.359375,19.5,25.088198911228663,1.3019283746556474,1.0,0.6591351085236947,1815,676,0.37245179063360884,8298,64,63.12130325674156,2.589606013763671e+27,1.2209363572671716e+24,0.7293580749205181,0.7235516790420778,67.90709387913225,10.832911070936643,11.01651812556555,14.032455234159778,13.294629648760328,8.804716253443527,47.25744662534436,5.359375,True,1133.0,0.8745874587458746,3.912305516265912,2121.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013468013468013467,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0059417706476530005,0.0054466230936819175,0.0,0.008958038661008957,5,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"asleep without seeing Mama again, to kiss her whatever the cost, even though it was with the certainty of being on bad terms with her for a long time after, when she came up to bed. The calm that came with the end of my distress filled me with an extraordinary joy, quite as much as did my expectation, my thirst for and my fear of danger. I opened the window noiselessly and sat down on the foot of my bed; I hardly moved so that I would not be heard from below. Outdoors, too, things seemed frozen in a silent intentness not to disturb the moonlight which, duplicating and distancing each thing by extending its shadow before it, denser and more concrete than itself, had at once thinned and enlarged the landscape like a map that had been folded and was now opened out. What needed to move, some leaves of the chestnut tree, moved. But their minute quivering, complete, executed even in its slightest nuances and ultimate refinements, did not spill over on to the rest, did not merge with it, remained circumscribed. Exposed against this silence, which absorbed nothing of them, the most distant noises, those that must have come from gardens that lay at the other end of town, could be perceived detailed with such 'finish' that they seemed to owe this effect of remoteness only to their pianissimo, like those muted motifs so well executed by the orchestra of the Conservatoire that, although you do not lose a single note, you nonetheless think you are hearing them far away from the concert hall and all the old subscribers my grandmother's sisters too, when Swann had given them his seats strained their ears as if they were listening to the distant advances of an army on the march that had not yet turned the corner of the rue de Trevise. I knew that of all possible positions the one I was now placing myself in was the one that could provoke the gravest consequences for me, coming from my parents, much graver in truth than a stranger would have supposed, the sort he would have believed could be produced only by truly shameful misdeeds. But in my upbringing, the order of misdeeds was not the same as in that of other children, and I had become accustomed to placing before all others (because there were probably none from which I needed to be more carefully protected) those whose common characteristic I now understand was that you give in to them by yielding to a nervous impulse. But at the time no one uttered this word, no one revealed this cause, which might have made me believe I was excusable for succumbing to them or even perhaps incapable of resisting them. But I recognized them clearly from the anguish that preceded them as well as from the rigour of the punishment that followed them; and I knew that the one I had just committed was in the same family as others for which I had been severely punished, though infinitely graver. When I went and placed myself in my mother's path at the moment she was going up to bed, and when she saw that I had stayed up to say goodnight to her again in the hallway, they would not let me continue to live at home, they would send me off to school the next day, that much was certain. Well! even if I had had to throw myself out of the window five minutes later, I still preferred this. What I wanted now was Mama, to say goodnight to her, I had gone too far along the road that led to the fulfilment of that desire to be able to turn back now. I heard my family's footsteps as they went out with Swann; and when the bell on the gate told me he had left, I went to the window. Mama was asking my father if he had thought the lobster was good and if M. Swann had had more coffee-and-pistachio ice cream. 'I found it quite ordinary, said my mother; I think next time we'll have to try another flavour. I can't tell you how changed I find Swann, said my great-aunt, he has aged so!' My great-aunt was so used to seeing Swann always as the same adolescent that she was surprised to find him suddenly less young than the age she continued to give him. And my family was also beginning to feel that in him this ageing was abnormal, excessive, shameful and deserved by the unmarried, by all those for whom it seems that the great day that has no tomorrow is longer than for others, because for them it is empty and the moments in it add up from morning on without then being divided among children. 'I think he has no end of worries with that wretched wife of his who is living with a certain Monsieur de Charlus, as all of Combray knows. It's the talk of the town.' My mother pointed out that in spite of this he had been looking much less sad for some time now. 'He also doesn't make that gesture of his as often, so like his father, of wiping his eyes and running his hand across his forehead. I myself think that in his heart of hearts he no longer loves that woman. Why, naturally he doesn't love her any more, answered my grandfather. I received a letter from him about it a long time ago by now, a letter with which I hastened not to comply and which leaves no doubt about his feelings, at least his feelings of love, for his wife. Well now! You see, you didn't thank him for the Asti,' added my grandfather, turning to his two sisters-in-law. 'What? We didn't thank him? I think, just between you and me, that I put it quite delicately, answered my aunt Flora. Yes, you managed it very well: quite admirable, said my Aunt Celine. But you were very good too. Yes, I was rather proud of my remark about kind neighbours. What? Is that what you call thanking him? exclaimed my grandfather. I certainly heard that, but devil take me if I thought it was directed at Swann. You can be sure he never noticed. But see here, Swann isn't stupid, I'm sure he appreciated it. After all, I couldn't tell him how many bottles there were and what the wine cost!' My father and mother were left alone there, and sat down for a moment; then my father said: 'Well, shall we go up to bed? If you like, my dear, even though I'm not the least bit sleepy; yet it couldn't be that perfectly harmless coffee ice cream that's keeping me so wide awake; but I can see a light in the servants' hall and since poor Francoise has waited up for me, I'll go and ask her to unhook my bodice while you're getting undressed. ' And my mother opened the latticed door that led from the vestibule to the staircase. Soon, I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I went without a sound into the hallway; my heart was beating so hard I had trouble walking, but at least it was no longer pounding from anxiety, but from terror and joy. I saw the light cast in the stairwell by Mama's candle. Then I saw Mama herself; I threw myself forward. In the first second, she looked at me with astonishment, not understanding what had happened. Then an expression of anger came over her face, she did not say a single word to me, and indeed for much less than this they would go several days without speaking to me. If Mama had said one word to me, it would have been an admission that they could talk to me again and in any case it would perhaps have seemed to me even more terrible, as a sign that, given the gravity of the punishment that was about to be prepared, silence, estrangement, would have been childish. A word would have been like the calm with which you answer a servant when you have just decided to dismiss him; the kiss you give a son you are sending off to enlist, whereas you would have refused it if you were simply going to be annoyed with him for a few days. But she heard my father coming up from the dressing-room where he had gone to undress and, to avoid the scene he would make over me, she said to me in a voice choked with anger: 'Run, run, so at least your father won't see you waiting like this as if you were out of your mind!' But I repeated to her: 'Come and say goodnight to me,' terrified as I saw the gleam from my father's candle already rising up the wall, but also using his approach as a means of blackmail and hoping that Mama, to avoid my father's finding me still there if she continued to refuse, would say: 'Go back to your room, I'll come.' It was too late, my father was there in front of us. Involuntarily, though no one heard, I murmured these words: 'I'm done for!' It was not so. My father was constantly refusing me permission for things that had been authorized in the more generous covenants granted by my mother and grandmother because he did not bother about 'principles' and for him there was no 'law of nations'. For a completely contingent reason, or even for no reason, he would at the last minute deny me a certain walk that was so customary, so consecrated that to deprive me of it was a violation, or, as he had done once again this evening, long before the ritual hour he would say to me: 'Go on now, up to bed, no arguments!' But also, because he had no principles (in my grandmother's sense), he was not properly speaking intransigent. He looked at me for a moment with an expression of surprise and annoyance, then as soon as Mama had explained to him in a few embarrassed words what had happened, he said to her: 'Go along with him, then. You were just saying you didn't feel very sleepy, stay in his room for a little while, I don't need anything. But my dear, answered my mother timidly, whether I'm sleepy or not doesn't change anything, we can't let the child get into the habit... But it isn't a question of habit, said my father, shrugging his shoulders, you can see the boy is upset, he seems very sad; look, we're not brutes! You'll end by making him ill, and that won't do us",2.932787636503044,1.050103125710394,0.43374595167921204,0.07535252334246051,4.11732152739347,4.0,2.2239238315957834,26.970149253731343,20.0,22.262323536222684,1.2340896513558384,1.0,0.5395175433351519,1807,610,0.33757609297177643,7779,67,63.94465411563968,5.899435124986479e+27,2.8240474509269883e+24,0.7611544087077632,0.751010543337235,75.0563140027588,9.490616094954117,9.173290809141736,12.448269994796355,11.447659020888914,7.3123408965135575,41.63534017791507,3.955223880597015,True,1218.0,0.881282910483485,3.723791287697463,2089.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004802171416640568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0034450360162856246,0.003758221108675227,0.0,0.0014360938247965534,7,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"much good! There are two beds in his room; go ahead and tell Francoise to prepare the big one for you and sleep there with him tonight. Now then, goodnight, I'm not as high-strung as the two of you, I'm going to bed.' It was impossible to thank my father; he would have been irritated by what he called mawkishness. I stood there not daring to move; he was still in front of us, tall, in his white nightshirt under the pink and violet Indian cashmere shawl that he tied around his head now that he had attacks of neuralgia, with the gesture of Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli23 that M. Swann had given me, as he told Sarah she must depart from the side of Isaac. This was many years ago. The staircase wall on which I saw the rising glimmer of his candle has long since ceased to exist. In me, too, many things have been destroyed that I thought were bound to last for ever and new ones have formed that have given birth to new sorrows and joys which I could not have foreseen then, just as the old ones have become difficult for me to understand. It was a very long time ago, too, that my father ceased to be able to say to Mama: 'Go with the boy.' The possibility of such hours will never be reborn for me. But for a little while now, I have begun to hear again very clearly, if I take care to listen, the sobs I was strong enough to contain in front of my father and that did not burst out until I found myself alone again with Mama. They have never really stopped; and it is only because life is quieting down around me more and more now that I can hear them again, like those convent bells covered so well by the clamour of the town during the day that one would think they had ceased altogether but which begin sounding again in the silence of the evening. Mama spent that night in my room; when I had just committed such a misdeed that I expected to have to leave the house, my parents granted me more than I could ever have won from them as reward for a good deed. Even at the moment when it manifested itself through this pardon, my father's conduct towards me retained that arbitrary and undeserved quality that was so characteristic of it and that arose from the fact that it generally resulted from fortuitous convenience rather than a premeditated plan. It may even be that what I called his severity, when he sent me to bed, deserved that name less than my mother's or my grandmother's, for his nature, in certain respects more different from mine than theirs was, had probably kept him from discovering until now how very unhappy I was every evening, something my mother and my grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough not to consent to spare me my suffering, they wanted to teach me to master it in order to reduce my nervous sensitivity and strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of another sort, I do not know if he would have been courageous enough for that: the one time he realized that I was upset, he had said to my mother: 'Go and comfort him.' Mama stayed in my room that night and, as though not to allow any remorse to spoil those hours which were so different from what I had had any right to expect, when Francoise, realizing that something extraordinary was happening when she saw Mama sitting next to me, holding my hand and letting me cry without scolding me, asked her: 'Why, Madame, now what's wrong with Monsieur that he's crying so?' Mama answered her: 'Why, even he doesn't know, Francoise, he's in a state; prepare the big bed for me quickly and go on up to bed yourself.' And so, for the first time, my sadness was regarded no longer as a punishable offence but as an involuntary ailment that had just been officially recognized, a nervous condition for which I was not responsible; I had the relief of no longer having to mingle qualms of conscience with the bitterness of my tears, I could cry without sin. I was also not a little proud, with respect to Francoise, of this turnabout in human affairs which, an hour after Mama had refused to come up to my room and had sent the disdainful answer that I should go to sleep, raised me to the dignity of a grown-up and brought me suddenly to a sort of puberty of grief, of emancipation from tears. I ought to have been happy: I was not. It seemed to me that my mother had just made me a first concession which must be painful to her, that this was a first abdication on her part before the ideal she had conceived for me, and that for the first time she, who was so courageous, was confessing herself defeated. It seemed to me that, if I had just gained a victory, it was over her, that I had succeeded, as illness, affliction, or age might have done, in slackening her will, in causing her judgment to weaken and that this evening was the beginning of a new era, would remain as a sad date. If I had now dared, I would have said to Mama: 'No I don't want this, don't sleep here.' But I was aware of the practical wisdom, the realism as it would be called now, which in her tempered my grandmother's ardently idealistic nature, and I knew that, now that the harm was done, she would prefer to let me at least enjoy the soothing pleasure of it and not disturb my father. True, my mother's lovely face still shone with youth that evening when she so gently held my hands and tried to stop my tears; but it seemed to me that this was precisely what should not have been, her anger would have saddened me less than this new gentleness which my childhood had not known before; it seemed to me that with an impious and secret hand I had just traced in her soul a first wrinkle and caused a first white hair to appear. At the thought of this my sobs redoubled, and then I saw that Mama, who never let herself give way to any emotion with me, was suddenly overcome by my own and was trying to suppress a desire to cry. When she saw that I had noticed, she said to me with a smile: 'There now, my little chick, my little canary, he's going to make his Mama as silly as himself if this continues. Look, since you're not sleepy and your mama isn't either, let's not go on upsetting each other, let's do something, let's get one of your books.' But I had none there. 'Would you enjoy it less if I took out the books your grandmother will be giving you on your saint's day? Think about it carefully: you mustn't be disappointed not to have anything the day after tomorrow.' On the contrary, I was delighted, and Mama went to get a packet of books, of which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which they were wrapped, more than their shape, short and thick, but which, in this first guise, though summary and veiled, already eclipsed the box of colours from New Year's Day and the silkworms from last year. They were La Mare au Diable, Francois le Champi, La Petite Fadette and Les Maitres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had first chosen the poems of Musset, a volume of Rousseau, and Indiana;24 for though she judged frivolous reading to be as unhealthy as sweets and pastries, it did not occur to her that a great breath of genius might have a more dangerous and less invigorating influence on the mind even of a child than would the open air and the sea breeze on his body. But as my father had nearly called her mad when he learned which books she wanted to give me, she had returned to the bookstore in Jouy-le-Vicomte herself, so that I would not risk not having my present (it was a burning-hot day and she had come home so indisposed that the doctor had warned my mother not to let her tire herself out that way again) and she had resorted to the four pastoral novels of George Sand. 'My dear daughter, she said to Mama, I could not bring myself to give the boy something badly written.' In fact, she could never resign herself to buying anything from which one could not derive an intellectual profit, and especially the profit which beautiful things afford us by teaching us to seek our pleasure elsewhere than in the satisfactions of material comfort and vanity. Even when she had to make someone a present of the kind called 'useful', when she had to give an armchair, silverware, a walking-stick, she looked for 'old' ones, as though, now that long desuetude had effaced their character of usefulness, they would appear more disposed to tell us about the life of people of other times than to serve the needs of our own life. She would have liked me to have in my room photographs of the most beautiful monuments or landscapes. But at the moment of buying them, and even though the thing represented had an aesthetic value, she found that vulgarity and utility too quickly resumed their places in that mechanical mode of representation, the photograph. She would try to use cunning and, if not to eliminate commercial banality entirely, at least to reduce it, to substitute for the greater part of it more art, to introduce into it in a sense several 'layers' of art: instead of photographs of Chartres Cathedral, the Fountains of Saint-Cloud, or Mount Vesuvius, she would make inquiries of Swann as to whether some great painter had not depicted them, and preferred to give me photographs of Chartres Cathedral by Corot,25 of the Fountains of Saint-Cloud by Hubert Robert,26 of Mount Vesuvius by Turner,27 which made one degree of art more. But if the photographer had been removed from the representation of the masterpiece or of nature and replaced by a great artist, he still reclaimed his rights to reproduce that very interpretation. Having deferred vulgarity as far as possible, my grandmother would try to move it back still farther. She would ask Swann if the work had not been engraved, preferring, whenever possible, old engravings that also had an interest beyond themselves, for example those",3.638354045388216,1.17233180749023,0.4362457777439452,0.05937808520058109,4.25428413488115,4.0,2.3406695023340673,40.2,36.0,25.27677897904627,1.265339966832504,1.0,0.6151922294911663,1809,653,0.3609729132117192,7970,45,62.430103771874954,1.2973273466468927e+27,6.313028450836461e+23,0.8058979829603975,0.7979948867199033,58.98423880597018,15.019011608623547,11.813810549772704,18.379613045881705,18.707678275290213,8.47887230514096,56.45207296849088,6.533333333333333,True,1179.0,0.8909975669099757,3.878345498783455,2055.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016376663254861822,0.01023541453428864,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004605936540429887,0.004912998976458547,0.006960081883316274,0.004379562043795621,8,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"that represent a masterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it today (like the engraving by Morghen28 of Leonardo's Last Supper before its deterioration). It must be said that the results of this interpretation of the art of gift-giving were not always very brilliant. The idea I formed of Venice from a drawing by Titian that is supposed to have the lagoon in the background was certainly far less accurate than the one I would have derived from simple photographs. We could no longer keep count, at home, when my great-aunt wanted to draw up an indictment against my grandmother, of the armchairs she had presented to young couples engaged to be married or old husbands and wives which, at the first attempt to make use of them, had immediately collapsed under the weight of one of the recipients. But my grandmother would have believed it petty to be overly concerned about the solidity of a piece of wood in which one could still distinguish a small flower, a smile, sometimes a lovely invention from the past. Even what might, in these pieces of furniture, answer a need, since it did so in a manner to which we are no longer accustomed, charmed her like the old ways of speaking in which we see a metaphor that is obliterated, in our modern language, by the abrasion of habit. Now, in fact, the pastoral novels of George Sand that she was giving me for my saint's day were, like an old piece of furniture, full of expressions that had fallen into disuse and turned figurative again, the sort you no longer find anywhere but in the country. And my grandmother had bought them in preference to others just as she would have been quicker to commend an estate on which there was a Gothic dovecote or another of those old things that exercise such a happy influence on the mind by filling it with longing for impossible voyages through time. Mama sat down by my bed; she had picked up Francois le Champi, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it, in my eyes, a distinct personality and a mysterious attraction. I had not yet read a real novel. I had heard people say that George Sand was an exemplary novelist. This already predisposed me to imagine something indefinable and delicious in Francois le Champi. Narrative devices intended to arouse curiosity or emotion, certain modes of expression that make one uneasy or melancholy, and that a reader with some education will recognize as common to many novels, appeared to me who considered a new book not as a thing having many counterparts, but as a unique person, having no reason for existing but in itself simply as a disturbing emanation of Francois le Champi's peculiar essence. Behind those events so ordinary, those things so common, those words so current, I sensed a strange sort of intonation, accentuation. The action began; it seemed to me all the more obscure because in those days, when I read, I often daydreamed, during entire pages, of something quite different. And in addition to the lacunae that this distraction left in the story, there was the fact, when Mama was the one reading aloud to me, that she skipped all the love scenes. Thus, all the bizarre changes that take place in the respective attitudes of the miller's wife and the child and that can be explained only by the progress of a nascent love seemed to me marked by a profound mystery whose source I readily imagined must be in that strange and sweet name 'Champi', which gave the child, who bore it without my knowing why, its vivid, charming purplish colour. If my mother was an unfaithful reader she was also, in the case of books in which she found the inflection of true feeling, a wonderful reader for the respect and simplicity of her interpretation, the beauty and gentleness of the sound of her voice. Even in real life, when it was people and not works of art that moved her to compassion or admiration, it was touching to see with what deference she removed from her voice, from her motions, from her words, any spark of gaiety that might hurt some mother who had once lost a child, any recollection of a saint's day, or a birthday, that might remind some old man of his advanced age, any remark about housekeeping that might seem tedious to some young scholar. In the same way, when she was reading George Sand's prose, which always breathes that goodness, that moral distinction which Mama had learned from my grandmother to consider superior to all else in life, and which I was to teach her only much later not to consider superior to all else in books too, taking care to banish from her voice any pettiness, any affectation that might have prevented that powerful torrent from being received by it, she imparted all the natural tenderness, all the ample sweetness they demanded to those sentences that seemed written for her voice and that remained, so to speak, altogether within the register of her sensibility. She found, to tackle them in the necessary tone, the warm inflection that pre-exists and dictated them, but that the words do not indicate; with this inflection she softened as she went along any crudeness in the tenses of the verbs, gave the imperfect and the past historic the sweetness that lies in goodness, the melancholy that lies in tenderness, directed the sentence that was ending towards the one that was about to begin, sometimes hurrying, sometimes slowing down the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, though their quantities were different, into one uniform rhythm, she breathed into this very common prose a sort of continuous emotional life. My remorse was quieted, I gave in to the sweetness of that night in which I had my mother close to me. I knew that such a night could not be repeated; that the greatest desire I had in the world, to keep my mother in my room during those sad hours of darkness, was too contrary to the necessities of life and the wishes of others for its fulfilment, granted this night, to be anything other than artificial and exceptional. Tomorrow my anguish would begin again and Mama would not stay here. But when my anguish was quieted, I no longer understood it; and then tomorrow night was still far away; I told myself I would have time to think what to do, even though that time could not bring me any access of power, since these things did not depend on my will and seemed more avoidable to me only because of the interval that still separated them from me. So it was that, for a long time, when, awakened at night, I remembered Combray again, I saw nothing of it but this sort of luminous panel, cut out from among indistinct shadows, like those panels which the glow of a Bengal light or some electric projection will cut out and illuminate in a building whose other parts remain plunged in darkness: at the rather broad base, the small parlour, the dining-room, the top of the dark path by which M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, would arrive, the front hall where I would head towards the first step of the staircase, so painful to climb, that formed, by itself, the very narrow trunk of this irregular pyramid; and, at the top, my bedroom with the little hallway and its glass-paned door for Mama's entrance; in a word, always seen at the same hour, isolated from everything that might surround it, standing out alone against the darkness, the bare minimum of scenery (like that which one sees prescribed at the beginnings of the old plays for performances in the provinces) needed for the drama of my undressing; as though Combray had consisted only of two floors connected by a slender staircase and as though it had always been seven o'clock in the evening there. The fact is, I could have answered anyone who asked me that Combray also included other things and existed at other hours. But since what I recalled would have been supplied to me only by my voluntary memory, the memory of the intelligence, and since the information it gives about the past preserves nothing of it, I would never have had any desire to think about the rest of Combray. It was all really quite dead for me. Dead for ever? Possibly. There is a great deal of chance in all this, and a second sort of chance, that of our death, often does not let us wait very long for the favours of the first. I find the Celtic belief very reasonable, that the souls of those we have lost are held captive in some inferior creature, in an animal, in a plant, in some inanimate thing, effectively lost to us until the day, which for many never comes, when we happen to pass close to the tree, come into possession of the object that is their prison. Then they quiver, they call out to us, and as soon as we have recognized them, the spell is broken. Delivered by us, they have overcome death and they return to live with us. It is the same with our past. It is a waste of effort for us to try to summon it, all the exertions of our intelligence are useless. The past is hidden outside the realm of our intelligence and beyond its reach, in some material object (in the sensation that this material object would give us) which we do not suspect. It depends on chance whether we encounter this object before we die, or do not encounter it. For many years already, everything about Combray that was not the theatre and drama of my bedtime had ceased to exist for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my mother, seeing that I was cold, suggested that, contrary to my habit, I have a little tea. I refused at first and then, I do not know why, changed my mind. She sent for one of those squat, plump cakes called petites madeleines that look as though they have been moulded in the grooved valve of a scallop-shell. And soon, mechanically, oppressed by the gloomy day and the prospect of a sad future, I carried to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had let soften a piece of madeleine. But at the very instant when the mouthful of tea mixed with cake-crumbs touched my palate, I quivered, attentive to the extraordinary thing that was happening in me. A delicious pleasure had invaded",3.438050378328147,1.4216449999662828,0.4391036874171474,0.052655475195323743,4.424460431654676,4.0,2.4374225512558767,40.15555555555556,31.0,37.24809051365694,1.3176535694521305,1.0,0.6767818520222051,1807,701,0.3879358052019923,8229,45,65.88137499459786,4.091830360143365e+28,2.017667830445446e+25,0.8299477716738527,0.8074849206347798,54.60361913546089,15.618978786201811,13.133204557630332,19.11700916190125,19.486986410871303,9.4786939679026,58.74991084055833,7.466666666666667,True,1105.0,0.8949704142011834,4.0576923076923075,2028.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006979758699770665,0.006979758699770665,0.006979758699770665,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008973975471133712,0.0053843852826802275,0.0,0.0029585798816568047,9,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"me, isolated me, without my having any notion as to its cause. It had immediately made the vicissitudes of life unimportant to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory, acting in the same way that love acts, by filling me with a precious essence: or rather this essence was not in me, it was me. I had ceased to feel I was mediocre, contingent, mortal. Where could it have come to me from this powerful joy? I sensed that it was connected to the taste of the tea and the cake, but that it went infinitely far beyond it, could not be of the same nature. Where did it come from? What did it mean? How could I grasp it? I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first, a third that gives me a little less than the second. It is time for me to stop, the virtue of the drink seems to be diminishing. It is clear that the truth I am seeking is not in the drink, but in me. The drink has awoken it in me, but does not know that truth, and cannot do more than repeat indefinitely, with less and less force, this same testimony which I do not know how to interpret and which I want at least to be able to ask of it again and find again, intact, available to me, soon, for a decisive clarification. I put down the cup and turn to my mind. It is up to my mind to find the truth. But how? What grave uncertainty, whenever the mind feels overtaken by itself; when it, the seeker, is also the obscure country where it must seek and where all its baggage will be nothing to it. Seek? Not only that: create. It is face to face with something that does not yet exist and that only it can accomplish, then bring into its light. And I begin asking myself again what it could be, this unknown state which brought with it no logical proof, but only the evidence of its felicity, its reality, and in whose presence the other states of consciousness faded away. I want to try to make it reappear. I go back in my thoughts to the moment when I took the first spoonful of tea. I find the same state, without any new clarity. I ask my mind to make another effort, to bring back once more the sensation that is slipping away. And, so that nothing may break the thrust with which it will try to grasp it again, I remove every obstacle, every foreign idea, I protect my ears and my attention from the noises in the next room. But feeling my mind grow tired without succeeding, I now force it to accept the very distraction I was denying it, to think of something else, to recuperate before a supreme attempt. Then for a second time I create an empty space before it, I confront it again with the still recent taste of that first mouthful and I feel something quiver in me, shift, try to rise, something that seems to have been unanchored at a great depth; I do not know what it is, but it comes up slowly; I feel the resistance and I hear the murmur of the distances traversed. Undoubtedly what is fluttering this way deep inside me must be the image, the visual memory which is attached to this taste and is trying to follow it to me. But it is struggling too far away, too confusedly; I can just barely perceive the neutral glimmer in which is blended the elusive eddying of stirred-up colours; but I cannot distinguish the form, cannot ask it, as the one possible interpreter, to translate for me the evidence of its contemporary, its inseparable companion, the taste, ask it to tell me what particular circumstance is involved, what period of the past. Will it reach the surface of my limpid consciousness this memory, this old moment which the attraction of an identical moment has come so far to summon, to move, to raise up from my very depths? I don't know. Now I no longer feel anything, it has stopped, gone back down perhaps; who knows if it will ever rise up from its darkness again? Ten times I must begin again, lean down towards it. And each time, the timidity that deters us from every difficult task, from every important piece of work, has counselled me to leave it, to drink my tea and think only about my worries of today, my desires for tomorrow, which may be pondered painlessly. And suddenly the memory appeared. That taste was the taste of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because that day I did not go out before it was time for Mass), when I went to say good morning to her in her bedroom, my Aunt Leonie would give me after dipping it in her infusion of tea or lime-blossom. The sight of the little madeleine had not recalled anything to me before I tasted it; perhaps because I had often seen them since, without eating them, on the pastry-cooks' shelves, and their image had therefore left those days of Combray and attached itself to others more recent; perhaps because, of these recollections abandoned so long outside my memory, nothing survived, everything had come apart; the forms and the form, too, of the little shell made of cake, so fatly sensual within its severe and pious pleating had been destroyed, or, still half asleep, had lost the force of expansion that would have allowed them to rejoin my consciousness. But, when nothing subsists of an old past, after the death of people, after the destruction of things, alone, frailer but more enduring, more immaterial, more persistent, more faithful, smell and taste still remain for a long time, like souls, remembering, waiting, hoping, on the ruin of all the rest, bearing without giving way, on their almost impalpable droplet, the immense edifice of memory. And as soon as I had recognized the taste of the piece of madeleine dipped in lime-blossom tea that my aunt used to give me (though I did not yet know and had to put off to much later discovering why this memory made me so happy), immediately the old grey house on the street, where her bedroom was, came like a stage-set to attach itself to the little wing opening on to the garden that had been built for my parents behind it (that truncated section which was all I had seen before then); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square, where they sent me before lunch, the streets where I went to do errands, the paths we took if the weather was fine. And as in that game in which the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little pieces of paper until then indistinct, which, the moment they are immersed in it, stretch and shape themselves, colour and differentiate, become flowers, houses, human figures, firm and recognizable, so now all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann's park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne, and the good people of the village and their little dwellings and the church and all of Combray and its surroundings, all of this which is assuming form and substance, emerged, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea. Combray, from far away, for ten leagues around, seen from the railroad when we arrived there the last week before Easter, was no more than a church summing up the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it into the distance, and, when one approached, holding close around its high dark cloak, in the middle of a field, against the wind, like a shepherdess her sheep, the woolly grey backs of the gathered houses, which a vestige of medieval ramparts girdled here and there with a line as perfectly circular as a small town in a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a little dreary, like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackish stones of the countryside, fronted by outside steps, capped with gables that cast shadows down before them, were so dark that once the daylight began to fade one had to draw back the curtains in the 'formal rooms'; streets with the solemn names of saints (of whom many were connected to the history of the earliest seigneurs of Combray): the rue Saint-Hilaire, the rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt's house stood, the rue Sainte-Hildegarde, along which her railings ran, and the rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which opened the little side-gate of her garden; and these streets of Combray exist in a part of my memory so withdrawn, painted in colours so different from those that now coat the world for me, that in truth all of them, and also the church that rose above them on the Square, appear to me more unreal even than the projections of the magic lantern; and that at certain moments, it seems to me that to be able to cross the rue Saint-Hilaire again, to be able to take a room in the rue de l'Oiseau at the old Hotellerie de l'Oiseau Flesche, from whose basement windows rose a smell of cooking that now and then still rises in me as intermittently and as warmly would be to enter into contact with the Beyond in a manner more marvellously supernatural than making the acquaintance of Golo or chatting with Genevieve de Brabant. My grandfather's cousin my great-aunt in whose house we lived, was the mother of that Aunt Leonie who, after the death of her husband, my Uncle Octave, no longer wished to leave, first Combray, then within Combray her house, then her bedroom, then her bed and no longer 'came down', always lying in an uncertain state of grief, physical debility, illness, obsession and piety. Her own rooms looked out on the rue Saint-Jacques, which ended much farther away in the Grand-Pre (as opposed to the Petit-Pre, a green in the middle of the town where three streets met), and which, smooth and grey, with the three high steps of sandstone before almost every door, seemed like a defile hewn by a cutter of Gothic images right out of the same stone from which he would have sculpted a creche or a calvary. My aunt effectively confined her life to two adjoining rooms, staying in one of them in the afternoon while the other was aired. These were the sorts of provincial rooms which just as in certain countries entire tracts of air or ocean are illuminated",3.2322560713638753,1.4254421739757297,0.4417671603563851,0.07691442944771747,4.273927392739274,4.0,2.2909378269043854,39.52173913043478,24.0,46.3229397253835,1.2546754675467546,1.0,0.5873085946312652,1818,665,0.3657865786578658,8060,46,70.77330416756334,5.450739991646995e+30,2.6105076588347675e+27,0.7874432414770126,0.7828377867964181,60.57489022815328,14.62864877792127,10.802804408421403,17.63487827043574,18.46106758501937,8.581738173817378,55.80336729325106,6.434782608695652,True,1111.0,0.8735632183908046,3.8601532567049808,2088.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012778904665314401,0.004462474645030426,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010344827586206896,0.002839756592292089,0.005679513184584178,0.006226053639846743,10,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"or perfumed by myriad protozoa that we cannot see enchant us with the thousand smells emanating from the virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret, invisible, superabundant and moral life which the atmosphere holds in suspense; smells still natural, certainly, and the colour of the weather like those of the neighbouring countryside, but already homey, human and enclosed, an exquisite, ingenious and limpid jelly of all the fruits of the year that have left the orchard for the cupboard; seasonal, but moveable and domestic, correcting the piquancy of the hoarfrost with the sweetness of warm bread, as lazy and punctual as a village clock, idle and orderly, heedless and foresightful, linen smells, morning smells, pious smells, happy with a peace that brings only an increase of anxiety and with a quality of the prosaic that serves as a great reservoir of poetry to one who passes through it without having lived in it. The air was saturated with the finest flour of a silence so nourishing, so succulent, that I could move through it only with a sort of greed, especially on those first mornings of Easter week, still cold, when I tasted it more keenly because I had only just arrived in Combray: before I went in to say good morning to my aunt, they made me wait for a moment, in the first room where the sun, still wintry, had come to warm itself before the fire, already lit between the two bricks and coating the whole room with an odour of soot, having the same effect as one of those great country 'front-of-the-ovens', or one of those chateau mantelpieces, beneath which one sits hoping that outdoors there will be an onset of rain, snow, even some catastrophic deluge so as to add, to the comfort of reclusion, the poetry of hibernation; I would take a few steps from the prayer stool to the armchairs of stamped velvet always covered with a crocheted antimacassar; and as the fire baked like a dough the appetizing smells with which the air of the room was all curdled and which had already been kneaded and made to 'rise' by the damp and sunny coolness of the morning, it flaked them, gilded them, puckered them, puffed them, making them into an invisible, palpable country pastry, an immense 'turnover' in which, having barely tasted the crisper, more delicate, more highly regarded but also drier aromas of the cupboard, the chest of drawers, the floral wallpaper, I would always come back with an unavowed covetousness to snare myself in the central, sticky, stale, indigestible and fruity smell of the flowered coverlet. In the next room, I would hear my aunt talking all alone in an undertone. She always talked rather softly because she thought there was something broken and floating in her head that she would have displaced by speaking too loudly, but she never remained for long, even alone, without saying something, because she believed it was beneficial to her throat and that if she prevented the blood from stopping there, she would reduce the frequency of the fits of breathlessness and the spasms from which she suffered; besides, in the absolute inertia in which she lived, she attributed to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance; she endowed them with a motility that made it difficult for her to keep them to herself, and lacking a confidant to whom she could communicate them, she announced them to herself, in a perpetual monologue that was her only form of activity. Unfortunately, having acquired the habit of thinking out loud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the next room, and I often heard her saying to herself: 'I must be sure to remember that I did not sleep' (for never sleeping was her great claim, and the language we all used deferred to it and was marked by it: in the morning Francoise did not come to 'wake' her, but 'entered' her room; when my aunt wanted to take a nap during the day, we said she wanted to 'reflect' or 'rest'; and when she happened to forget herself, while chatting, so far as to say: 'what woke me up' or 'I dreamed that', she would blush and correct herself instantly). After a moment I would go in and kiss her; Francoise would be steeping her tea; or, if my aunt was feeling agitated, she would ask instead for her infusion and I would be the one entrusted with pouring from the pharmacy bag on to a plate the quantity of lime-blossom which then had to be put into the boiling water. The drying of the stems had curved them into a whimsical trellis-work in whose interlacings the pale flowers opened, as if a painter had arranged them, had made them pose in the most ornamental way. The leaves, having lost or changed their aspect, looked like the most disparate things, a fly's transparent wing, the white back of a label, a rose petal, but these things had been heaped up, crushed or woven as in the construction of a nest. A thousand small useless details the charming prodigality of the pharmacist that would have been eliminated in an artificial preparation gave me, like a book in which one is amazed to encounter the name of a person one knows, the pleasure of realizing that these were actually stems of real lime-blossoms, like those I saw in the avenue de la Gare, altered precisely because they were not duplicates but themselves, and because they had aged. And since here, each new characteristic was only the metamorphosis of an old characteristic, in some little grey balls I recognized the green buds that had not come to term; but especially the pink lustre, lunar and soft, that made the flowers stand out amid the fragile forest of stems where they were suspended like little gold roses a sign, like the glow on a wall that still reveals the location of a fresco that has worn away, of the difference between the parts of the tree that had been 'in colour' and those that had not showed me that these petals were in fact the same ones that, before filling the pharmacy bag with flowers, had embalmed the spring evenings. That candle-pink flame was their colour still, but half doused and drowsing in the diminished life that was theirs now, and that is a sort of twilight of flowers. Soon my aunt would be able to dip into the boiling infusion, of which she savoured the taste of dead leaf or faded flower, a small madeleine, a piece of which she would hold out to me when it had sufficiently softened. On one side of her bed was a large yellow chest of drawers of lemon-wood and a table that was akin to both a dispensary and a high altar, on which, below a small statue of the Virgin and a bottle of Vichy-Celestins, could be found her missals and her medical prescriptions, everything needed for following from her bed both the services and her regimen, for not missing the hour either of her pepsin or of Vespers. On the other side, her bed lay by the window, she had the street there before her eyes and on it from morning to night, to divert her melancholy, like the Persian princes, would read the daily but immemorial chronicle of Combray, which she would afterwards commentate with Francoise. I had not been with my aunt five minutes before she would send me away for fear that I would tire her. She would hold out to my lips her sad, pale, dull forehead, on which, at this morning hour, she had not yet arranged her false hair, and where the bones showed through like the points of a crown of thorns or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to me: 'Now, my poor child, off you go, get ready for Mass; and if you see Francoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with all of you, she should come up soon to see if I need anything. Francoise, who had been in her service for years and did not suspect at that time that one day she would enter exclusively into ours, did in fact neglect my aunt a little during the months when we were there. There had been a time, in my childhood, before we went to Combray, when my Aunt Leonie still spent the winters in Paris with her mother, when Francoise was such a stranger to me that on January 1, before entering my great-aunt's, my mother would put a five-franc coin in my hand and say to me: 'Take great care not to give it to the wrong person. Wait to give it until you hear me say, ""Good morning, Francoise""; at the same time, I'll touch you lightly on the arm.' Hardly had we arrived in my aunt's dim hall than we would see in the shadows, under the flutes of a dazzling bonnet as stiff and fragile as if it were made of spun sugar, the concentric ripples of an anticipatory smile of gratitude. It was Francoise, standing motionless in the frame of the little door of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we were a little used to this chapel darkness, we could distinguish on her face the disinterested love of humanity, the fond respect for the upper classes excited in the best regions of her heart by the hope of a New Year's gift. Mama pinched my arm violently and said in a loud voice: 'Good morning, Francoise.' At this signal, my fingers opened and I released the coin, which found a hand to receive it that was embarrassed but outstretched. But ever since we had begun going to Combray I knew no one better than Francoise, we were her favourites, she had for us, at least during the first years, not only as much regard as for my aunt, but also a keener liking, because we added, to the prestige of being part of the family (she had, for the invisible bonds formed between the members of a family by the circulation of the same blood, as much respect as a Greek tragedian), the charm of not being her usual masters. And so with what joy would she welcome us, feeling sorry for us that we did not yet have finer weather, the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind, while Mama asked her for news of her daughter and her nephews, whether her grandson was a pretty child, what they were planning to make of him, whether he was going to",4.068121713984563,1.149282263577108,0.4340014526724105,0.05850984315382162,4.331494760066189,4.0,2.319938238474589,67.14814814814815,44.0,57.774596303670755,1.274131274131274,1.0,0.6018709369930462,1813,711,0.3921676778819636,8115,27,65.9256576556364,4.277099324035333e+28,2.0672302194467536e+25,0.8674639669748453,0.8382523584365845,30.88812383812386,25.63252681252681,13.95711679800035,28.99935854221569,32.54541439398583,9.228372862658578,84.74329431472289,11.814814814814815,True,1107.0,0.8782020299661673,3.9221846302561625,2069.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.002420574886535552,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011497730711043872,0.0033282904689863843,0.0,0.005316578057032383,11,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"be like his grandmother. And when there was no one else there, Mama, who knew that Francoise still mourned her parents, who had died years ago, would talk to her about them gently, ask her for a thousand details about what sort of life they had led. She had guessed that Francoise did not like her son-in-law and that he spoiled the pleasure she took in being with her daughter, with whom she could not chat as freely when he was there. And so, when Francoise went to see them, a few leagues from Combray, Mama would say to her, smiling: 'Isn't it so, Francoise, if Julien is obliged to be away and you have Marguerite all to yourself all day long, you'll be sorry, but you'll make the best of it?' And Francoise would say, laughing: 'Madame knows everything; Madame is worse than those x-rays' (she said x with an affected difficulty and a smile to poke fun at herself, an ignorant woman, for using that erudite term) 'that they brought in for Mme Octave and that see what you have in your heart,' and disappeared, embarrassed that someone was paying attention to her, perhaps so that we would not see her cry; Mama was the first person who gave her that sweet sensation, the feeling that her life as a country woman, her joys, her sorrows could be of some interest, could be a reason for pleasure or sadness in someone other than herself. My aunt was resigned to managing without her to some extent during our stay, knowing how much my mother appreciated the service of this maid who was so intelligent and active, who was as beautiful at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a bonnet whose dazzling rigid flutes appeared to be made of porcelain, as she was when going to High Mass; who did everything well, working like a horse, whether she was in good health or not, but without a fuss, as though it were nothing, the only one of my aunt's maids who, when Mama asked for hot water or black coffee, brought them really boiling; she was one of those servants who, in a household, are at the same time those most immediately displeasing to a stranger, perhaps because they do not bother to win him over and are not attentive to him, knowing very well they have no need of him, that one would stop seeing him rather than dismiss them; and who are, on the other hand, those most valued by masters who have tested their real capacities, and do not care about the superficial charm, the servile chatter that makes a favourable impression on a visitor, but that often cloaks an ineducable incompetence. When Francoise, having seen that my parents had everything they needed, went back for the first time to give my aunt her pepsin and ask what she would like to have for lunch, it was quite rare that she was not already required to offer an opinion or provide explanations about some event of importance: Francoise, imagine, Mme Goupil went past more than a quarter of an hour late going to fetch her sister; if she lingers along the way it wouldn't surprise me at all if she were to arrive after the elevation. Well, there wouldn't be anything astonishing in that, answered Francoise. Francoise, if you had come five minutes earlier you would have seen Mme Imbert go past carrying some asparagus twice as fat as Mere Callot's; now try to find out from her maid where she got them. You have been serving us asparagus in every sauce this year; you of all people might have found some like those for our travellers. It wouldn't be surprising if they came from M. le Cure's, said Francoise. Do you expect me to believe that, my poor Francoise? answered my aunt, shrugging her shoulders. From M. le Cure's! You know very well he grows only wretched, spindly little asparagus. I tell you these were as fat as a woman's arm. Not your arm, of course, but one like mine, poor thing, which has got so much thinner again this year... Francoise, didn't you hear those chimes that nearly split my head open? No, Madame Octave. Ah, my poor girl, you must have a solid head, you can thank the Good Lord for that. It was Maguelone coming to get Doctor Piperaud. He came back out with her right away and they turned into the rue de l'Oiseau. Some child must be ill. Oh my, dear God, sighed Francoise, who could not hear of a misfortune occurring to a stranger, even in a distant part of the world, without beginning to lament. Francoise, now who were they ringing the passing bell for? Oh, dear God, it must have been for Mme Rousseau. I'm blessed if I hadn't forgotten that she passed away the other night. Oh, it's time for the Good Lord to call me home, I don't know what I've done with my head since my poor Octave died. But I'm wasting your time, my girl. Not at all, Madame Octave, my time is not so precious; He who made it did not sell it to us. I'm only just going to see that my fire isn't out. In this way Francoise and my aunt together appraised, during that morning session, the first events of the day. But sometimes those events assumed a character so mysterious and so grave that my aunt felt she could not wait for the moment when Francoise would come up, and four astounding peals of the bell would echo through the house. But Madame Octave, it isn't time for your pepsin yet, Francoise would say. Were you feeling faint? Not at all, Francoise, my aunt would say, or rather yes, you know quite well that there are very few occasions now when I don't feel faint; one day I'll pass away like Mme Rousseau without even time to collect myself; but that's not why I rang. Would you believe that I just saw Mme Goupil as clearly as I see you now with a little girl whom I don't know at all? Now go fetch two sous' worth of salt at Camus's. It's not often that Theodore can't tell you who someone is. But that'll be M. Pupin's daughter,' Francoise would say, preferring to be satisfied with an immediate explanation since she had already been to Camus's twice that morning. M. Pupin's daughter! Oh, do you expect me to believe that, my poor Francoise? And you think I wouldn't have recognized her? But I don't mean the big one, Madame Octave, I mean the little one that's away at school in Jouy. I think I saw her once already this morning. That must be it, said my aunt. It must be she's come for the holidays. That's it! There's no need to ask, she will have come for the holidays. But then any time now we might very likely see Mme Sazerat come and ring at her sister's for lunch. That's what it is! I saw Galopin's boy going past with a tart! You'll see, the tart was on its way to Mme Goupil's. Once Mme Goupil has a visitor, Madame Octave, it won't be long before you'll see all her folk coming back for lunch, because it's not so early as it was, said Francoise, who, in a hurry to go back down in order to see to lunch, was not sorry to leave my aunt the prospect of this distraction. Oh, not before noon! answered my aunt in a tone of resignation, casting an uneasy glance at the clock, yet furtively so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced everything, nevertheless took such a lively pleasure in learning whom Mme Goupil was having to lunch, a pleasure that would unfortunately have to wait a little more than an hour longer. 'And on top of that, it will happen during my lunch!' she added half-aloud to herself. Her lunch was enough of a distraction for her so that she did not wish for another one at the same time. 'At least you won't forget to give me my eggs with cream in a flat plate?' These were the only plates with pictures on them, and my aunt amused herself at each meal by reading the inscription on the one she was served that day. She would put on her glasses and spell out: Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Aladdin or the Magic Lamp, and smile, saying: 'Very good, very good.' I would certainly have gone to Camus's... Francoise would say, seeing that now my aunt would not send her there. No, no, it's not worth the trouble any more, it's certainly Mlle Pupin. My poor Francoise, I'm sorry to have made you come up for nothing. But my aunt knew perfectly well it was not for nothing that she had rung for Francoise, since, in Combray, a person 'whom one did not know at all' was a creature as scarcely believable as a mythological god, and in fact one could not remember when, any time one of these stupefying apparitions had occurred, in the rue du Saint-Esprit or on the square, well-conducted research had not ended by reducing the fabulous character to the proportions of a 'person one knew', either personally or abstractly, in his or her civil status, as having such-and-such a degree of kinship with some people of Combray. It was Mme Sauton's son returning from military service, Abbe Perdreau's niece leaving the convent, the cure's brother, a tax-collector at Chateaudun, who had just retired or who had come to spend the holidays. One had had, upon seeing them, the shock of believing that there were in Combray people whom one did not know at all, simply because one had not recognized them right away. And yet, long in advance, Mme Sauton and the cure had let everyone know that they were awaiting their 'travellers'. When in the evening I went upstairs, after returning home, to describe our walk to my aunt, if I was so imprudent as to tell her that we had met, near Pont-Vieux, a man my grandfather did not know, 'A man Grandfather did not know at all! she would cry. Ah! I don't believe it!' Nonetheless somewhat disturbed by this news, she would want to clear the matter up, my grandfather would be summoned. 'Now who did you meet near Pont-Vieux, Uncle? A man you didn't know? But I did know him, my grandfather would answer, it was Prosper, the brother of Mme Bouilleboeuf's gardener. Ah! All right,' my aunt would say, calmed and a little flushed; shrugging her shoulders with an ironic smile,",2.806075212288325,1.240382359055355,0.4125329741846501,0.07227375159174472,4.151933701657459,4.0,2.181947307075299,22.625,13.0,30.25821169533983,1.2176795580110498,1.0,0.5453136631697245,1810,582,0.32154696132596683,7961,80,63.77505445891785,4.979138818539217e+27,2.3083629200459974e+24,0.6813405266479601,0.6801189678028609,80.85493439226522,7.602368784530388,8.769984970463412,10.773756906077349,9.438107734806632,7.305082872928178,37.7078729281768,3.4125,True,1170.0,0.866481223922114,3.690774223458507,2157.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02919782809138408,0.01577707202130929,0.01577707202130929,0.010039954922651367,0.010039954922651367,0.010039954922651367,0.010039954922651367,0.0051224259809445755,0.006146911177133491,0.00602688919796013,12,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"it touched without any separation; a simple citizen of Combray that could have had its number in the street if the streets of Combray had had numbers, and where it seems that the postman should have had to stop in the morning when he was making his rounds, before going into Mme Loiseau's and upon coming out of M. Rapin's, there existed, however, between it and everything that was not it a demarcation that my mind was never able to cross. Even though Mme Loiseau might have at her window fuchsias which developed the bad habit of forever allowing their branches to run all over with heads lowered, and whose flowers had no business more pressing, when they were large enough, than to go and cool their flushed, violet cheeks against the dark front of the church, for me the fuchsias did not for this reason become holy; between the flowers and the blackened stone against which they leaned, if my eyes perceived no interval, my mind reserved an abyss. One could recognize the steeple of Saint-Hilaire from quite far off inscribing its unforgettable form on the horizon where Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which, in Easter week, was bringing us from Paris, my father caught sight of it as it slipped by turns over all the furrows of the sky and sent its little iron weathercock running in all directions, he would say to us: 'Come, gather up the rugs, we're here.' And on one of the longest walks we took from Combray, there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on an immense plateau closed at the horizon by jagged forests above which rose only the delicate tip of the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, but so thin, so pink, that it seemed merely scratched on the sky by a fingernail which wanted to give this landscape, this exclusively natural picture, that little mark of art, that indication of human presence. When one drew near and could see the remains of the half-destroyed square tower which, not as high, still stood next to it, one was struck most of all by the dark, reddish shade of the stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one might have thought it, rising above the stormy violet of the vineyards, a ruin of purple practically the colour of a wild vine. Often in the square, when we were coming home, my grandmother would make me stop to look at it. From the windows of its tower, placed two by two one above the other, with the exact and original proportion in their spacing that gives beauty and dignity not just to human faces, it loosed, dropped at regular intervals, volleys of crows which, for a moment, circled about shrieking, as if the old stones that allowed them to hop and flutter without appearing to see them had suddenly become uninhabitable and emitted some principle of infinite agitation, struck them and driven them out. Then, after striping in every direction the violet velvet of the evening air, they would return suddenly calm to be reabsorbed into the tower, which was no longer baneful but once again benign, a few of them sitting here and there, apparently motionless, but perhaps snapping up some insect, on the tip of a turret, like a seagull as still as a fisherman on the crest of a wave. Without really knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, of pretension, of meanness, which made her love and believe rich in beneficent influence not only nature, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, shrunk and reduced it, but also works of genius. And certainly, every part of the church that one could see distinguished it from all other buildings by a sort of thoughtfulness that was infused into it, but it was in the steeple that it seemed to become aware of itself, affirm an individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple that spoke for it. I believe above all that, confusedly, my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what for her had the highest value in the world, an air of naturalness and an air of distinction. Knowing nothing about architecture, she would say: 'My children, make fun of me if you like, perhaps it isn't beautiful according to the rules, but I like its strange old face. I'm sure that if it could play the piano it would not play drily.' And looking at it, following with her eyes the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its slopes of stone, which approached each other as they rose like hands meeting in prayer, she would join so fully in the effusion of the spire that her gaze seemed to soar with it; and at the same time she would smile in a friendly way at the worn old stones, of which the setting sun now illuminated only the topmost part and which, the moment they entered that sunny region, softened by the light, appeared suddenly to have risen much higher, to be quite far away, like a song taken up again in 'falsetto' an octave above. It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that gave all the occupations, all the hours, all the viewpoints of the town their shape, their crown, their consecration. From my bedroom, I could see only its base, which had been covered with tiles; but when, on Sunday, I saw them, on a warm summer morning, blazing like a black sun, I would say to myself: 'Good Heavens! Nine o'clock! I'd better get ready for Mass if I want to have time to go and give Aunt Leonie a kiss first,' and I knew exactly the colour of the sun on the square, the heat and dust of the market, the shadow made by the awning of the store which Mama would perhaps enter before Mass in an odour of unbleached linen, to buy some handkerchief which would be displayed to her under the direction of the shopkeeper, his chest outthrust, who, as he prepared to close, had just gone into the back of the shop to put on his Sunday jacket and soap his hands, which it was his habit, every five minutes, even in the most melancholy of circumstances, to rub together with an air of enterprise, celebration and success. When after Mass we went in to ask Theodore to bring us a brioche larger than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come from Thiberzy to have lunch with us, we would have the steeple there in front of us, itself golden and baked like a greater blessed brioche, with flakes and gummy drippings of sun, pricking its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, when I was coming home from a walk and thinking about the moment when I would soon have to say goodnight to my mother and not see her any more, it was on the contrary so soft, in the close of day, that it looked as if it had been set down and crushed like a cushion of brown velvet against the pale sky which had yielded under its pressure, hollowing slightly to give it room and flowing back over its edges; and the cries of the birds that wheeled around it seemed to increase its silence, lift its spire to a greater height and endow it with something ineffable. Even on the errands we had to do behind the church, where we could not see it, everything seemed to be arranged in relation to the steeple, which would rise up here or there between the houses, perhaps even more affecting when it appeared that way, without the church. And certainly, there are many others that are more beautiful when seen this way, and I have in my memory vignettes of steeples rising above roofs which have a different artistic character from those composed by the sad streets of Combray. I will never forget, in a curious Normandy town near Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses that are in many respects dear to me and venerable and between which, when you look at it from the lovely garden that descends from the front steps to the river, the Gothic spire of a church hidden behind them soars up, appearing to complete, to surmount their facades, but in a material so different, so precious, so annulated, so pink, so polished, that you see clearly it no more belongs to them than does the crimson crenellated spire of some sea-shell, tapering to a turret and glazed with enamel, to the two handsome, smooth pebbles between which it is caught on the beach. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the city, I know a window from which you can see, beyond a foreground, middle ground and even third ground composed of the piled-up roofs of several streets, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes also, in the noblest 'proofs' of it printed by the atmosphere, a decanted cindery black, which is in fact the dome of Saint-Augustin and which gives this view of Paris the character of certain views of Rome by Piranesi. But since into none of these little engravings, with whatever taste my memory may have executed them, was it able to put what I had lost a long time ago, the feeling that makes us not consider a thing a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without equivalent, none of them holds in subjection an entire profound part of my life, as does the memory of those views of the Combray steeple from the streets behind the church. Whether we saw it at five o'clock, when we went to get the letters at the post office, a few houses away from us to the left, abruptly lifting with an isolated peak the ridge line of the roofs; or whether, on the other hand, if we wanted to go in to ask for news of Mme Sazerat, our eyes followed that line, low again after the descent of its other slope, knowing we would have to turn at the second street after the steeple; or whether, again, going on farther, if we went to the station, we saw it obliquely, showing in profile new edges and surfaces like a solid caught at an unfamiliar moment of its revolution; or whether, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, muscularly gathered and raised to a greater height by the perspective, seemed to spring with the effort the steeple was making to hurl its spire into the heart of the sky: it was always to the steeple that we had to return, always the steeple that dominated everything, summing",4.053745490858183,1.075654146938748,0.46239736426818545,0.06250591545513227,4.33886124930901,4.0,2.2579970350684424,67.0,69.0,40.713997956840714,1.2581536760641239,1.0,0.5770831868769344,1809,688,0.38032061912658927,8108,27,67.26702431189334,1.6356767205294075e+29,7.990604399264326e+25,0.822838605596469,0.7997021190822124,32.390199004975145,25.38621337755666,13.5591,28.790049751243785,32.506036484245435,9.270713101160858,85.46323935876174,12.37037037037037,True,1110.0,0.8881289692232536,3.9609184171958964,2047.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021901493742430358,0.018974566007266856,0.013322567622123537,0.008074283407347598,0.0,0.0,0.015139281388776746,0.007064997981429148,0.008074283407347598,0.006350757205666829,14,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"she would add: 'Now, he told me you had met a man you didn't know!' And they would advise me to be more circumspect the next time and not to go on agitating my aunt with thoughtless remarks. One knew everybody so well, in Combray, animals and people, that if my aunt had chanced to see a dog pass by 'whom she did not know at all', she would not stop thinking about it and devoting to this incomprehensible fact all her talents for induction and her hours of freedom. That must be Mme Sazerat's dog, Francoise would say, without great conviction but in order to pacify my aunt, and so that she would not 'split her head in two'. As if I didn't know Mme Sazerat's dog! my aunt would answer, her critical mind not accepting a fact so easily. Then it will be the new dog M. Galopin brought back from Lisieux. That must be it. It seems it's quite an affable creature, added Francoise, who had got the information from Theodore, as clever as a Christian, always in a good humour, always friendly, always as agreeable as you might wish. It's uncommon for an animal of that age to be so well-behaved already. Madame Octave, I will have to leave you, I haven't time to enjoy myself, here it's almost ten o'clock, and my stove not lit yet, even, and I still have my asparagus to scrape. What, Francoise, more asparagus! Why, you've got a regular mania for asparagus this year. You'll make our Parisians grow tired of it! Why, no, Madame Octave, they like it very much. They'll come home from church with an appetite and you'll see, they won't eat it with the backs of their spoons. Church; why, they must be there already; you'd do well not to waste any time. Go and look after your lunch. While my aunt was gossiping with Francoise, I was going to Mass with my parents. How I loved it, how clearly I can see it again; our Church! The old porch by which we entered, black, pocked like a skimming ladle, was uneven and deeply hollowed at the edges (like the font to which it led), as if the gentle brushing of the countrywomen's cloaks as they entered the church and of their timid fingers taking holy water could, repeated over centuries, acquire a destructive force, bend the stone and carve it with furrows like those traced by the wheel of a cart in a boundary-stone which it knocks against every day. Its tombstones, under which the noble dust of the abbots of Combray, who were buried there, formed for the choir a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer inert and hard matter, for time had softened them and made them flow like honey beyond the bounds of their own square shapes, which, in one place, they had overrun in a flaxen billow, carrying off on their drift a flowered Gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble; and into which, elsewhere, they had reabsorbed themselves, further contracting the elliptical Latin inscription, introducing a further caprice in the arrangement of those abridged characters, bringing close together two letters of a word of which the others had been disproportionately distended. Its windows never sparkled as much as on the days when the sun hardly appeared, so that, if it was grey outside, we were sure it would be beautiful inside the church; one was filled to its very top by a single figure like a king in a game of cards, who lived up there, under an architectural canopy, between heaven and earth (and in whose slanting blue light, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there is no service at one of those rare times when the church, airy, vacant, more human, luxurious, with some sun on its rich furniture, looked almost habitable, like the hall of sculpted stone and painted glass of a medieval-style mansion one would see Mme Sazerat kneel for a moment, setting down on the next prayer stool a packet of petits fours tied with string that she had just picked up from the pastry-cook across the street and was going to take back home for lunch); in another, a mountain of pink snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frosted the very glass itself, which it swelled with its cloudy sleet like a window-pane on which there remained a few snowflakes, but flakes lit by some aurora (by the same, no doubt, that flushed the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh they seemed set there momentarily by a gleam from outside about to vanish, rather than by colours attached for ever to the stone); and all were so old that here and there one saw their silvery age sparkle with the dust of the centuries and show, shimmering and worn down to the thread, the weft of their soft tapestry of glass. One of them, a tall compartment, was divided into a hundred or so small rectangular panes in which blue predominated, like a great game of cards resembling the ones that were meant to entertain King Charles VI;1 but either because a beam of sunlight was shining, or because my gaze, as it moved, carried across the glass, snuffed and lit again by turns, a moving precious conflagration, the next moment it had assumed the changing lustre of a peacock's train, then trembled and undulated in a flaming and chimerical rain that dripped from the top of the dark rocky vault, along the damp walls, as if this were the nave of some grotto iridescent with sinuous stalactites into which I was following my parents, who were carrying their prayer books; a moment later the little lozenge-shaped panes had assumed the deep transparency, the infrangible hardness of sapphires which had been juxtaposed on some immense breast-plate, but behind which one felt, more beloved than all these riches, a momentary smile of sunlight; it was as recognizable in the soft blue billow with which it bathed the precious stones as on the pavement of the square or the straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays when we had arrived before Easter, it consoled me for the earth being still bare and black, by bringing into bloom, as in a historical spring-time dating from the age of Saint Louis's successors, this dazzling gilded carpet of glass forget-me-nots. Two high-warp tapestries represented the coronation of Esther (tradition had it that Ahasuerus had been given the features of a king of France and Esther those of a lady of Guermantes with whom he was in love), to which their colours, by melting, had added expression, relief, light: a little pink floated over Esther's lips outside the tracing of their outline; the yellow of her dress spread so unctuously, so thickly, that it acquired a kind of solidity and stood out boldly from the receding atmosphere; and the green of the trees, remaining vivid in the lower parts of the panel of silk and wool, but 'gone' at the top, brought out in a paler tone, above the dark trunks, the lofty yellowing branches, gilded and half obliterated by the abrupt, slanting illumination of an invisible sun. All this, and still more the precious objects that had come into the church from figures who were for me almost legendary (the gold cross worked, they said, by Saint Eloi2 and given by Dagobert, the tomb of the sons of Louis the Germanic,3 of porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I moved through the church, when we went to our seats, as though through a valley visited by the fairies, in which a country person is amazed to see in a rock, a tree, a pool, the palpable trace of their supernatural passage, all this made it, for me, something entirely different from the rest of the town: an edifice occupying a space with, so to speak, four dimensions the fourth being Time extending over the centuries its nave which, from bay to bay, from chapel to chapel, seemed to vanquish and penetrate not only a few yards but epoch after epoch from which it emerged victorious; hiding the rough, savage eleventh century in the thickness of the walls, from which it appeared with its heavy arches plugged and blinded by crude blocks of ashlar only in the deep gash incised near the porch by the tower staircase, and even there concealed by the graceful Gothic arcades that crowded coquettishly in front of it like older sisters who, to hide him from strangers, place themselves smiling in front of a younger brother who is boorish, sulky and badly dressed; lifting into the heavens above the square a tower which had contemplated Saint Louis and seemed to see him still; and plunging down with its crypt into a Merovingian night, in which, groping their way as they guided us under the dark vault as powerfully ribbed as the wing of an immense stone bat, Theodore and his sister would light for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert's4 little daughter, on which a deep scallop like the mark of a fossil had been dug, it was said, 'by a crystal lamp which, on the night the Frankish princess was murdered, had separated of its own accord from the golden chains by which it hung on the site of the present apse and without the crystal breaking, without the flame going out, had sunk deep into the stone which gave way softly under it'. The apse of the Combray church; what can one say about it? It was so crude, so lacking in artistic beauty and even religious spirit. From outside, because the street crossing it overlooked was on a lower level, its crude wall rose up from a sub-basement of quite unpolished ashlar, bristling with pebbles, and having nothing particularly ecclesiastical about it, the windows seemed to have been pierced at an excessive height, and the whole looked more like a prison wall than a church wall. And certainly, later, when I recalled all the glorious apses I had seen, it would never have occurred to me to compare them with the apse of Combray. But, one day, at the bend of a little street in a country town, I noticed, opposite the crossing of three lanes, a rough and unusally high wall with windows pierced far above and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. Then I did not ask myself as at Chartres or Rheims how powerfully it expressed religious feeling, but involuntarily exclaimed: 'The Church!' The church! Familiar; flanked, in the rue Saint-Hilaire, where its north door was situated, by its two neighbours, M. Rapin's pharmacy and Mme Loiseau's house, which",3.3822245405742724,1.3554584930074047,0.42032561386434886,0.07564470917612318,4.423055708769994,4.0,2.3340114902716373,53.3235294117647,18.0,86.4545853539286,1.2801985659128516,1.0,0.6282814040089251,1813,748,0.4125758411472697,8346,34,64.85362750185514,1.4641061182005469e+28,6.985239113552227e+24,0.752966433763504,0.7503830660134554,44.406818970831594,20.312519548359884,13.023866798666859,23.57982544369099,26.064357094189027,9.65246552675124,71.30477596443983,9.588235294117647,True,1058.0,0.8754770992366412,3.9818702290076335,2096.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003942440370589394,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008870490833826138,0.0,0.0,0.00715648854961832,13,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the finger of God, whose body might be hidden in the crowd of humans, though I would not confuse it with them because of that. And even today, if in a large provincial town or in a part of Paris I do not know well, a passing stranger who has 'put me on the right path' shows me in the distance, as a reference point, some hospital belfry, some convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of a street I am supposed to take, if only my memory can obscurely find in it some small feature resembling the dear departed form, the stranger, if he turns around to make sure I am not going astray, may, to his astonishment, see me, forgetting the walk I had begun or the necessary errand, remain there in front of the steeple for hours, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep in myself lands recovered from oblivion draining and rebuilding themselves; and then no doubt, and more anxiously than a short time before when I asked him to direct me, I am still seeking my path, I am turning a corner... but... I am doing so in my heart... As we returned home from Mass, we would often meet M. Legrandin, who was detained in Paris by his profession of engineer and, except during the summer vacation, could come to his property in Combray only from Saturday evening until Monday morning. He was one of those men who, quite apart from a career in science in which they have in fact been brilliantly successful, possess an entirely different culture, one that is literary, artistic, which their professional specialization does not make use of and which enriches their conversation. Better-read than many men of letters (we did not know at that time that M. Legrandin had a certain reputation as a writer and we were very surprised to see that a famous musician had composed a melody to some verses of his), gifted with more 'facility' than many painters, they imagine that the life they are leading is not the one that really suits them and they bring to their actual occupations either an indifference mingled with whimsy, or an application that is sustained and haughty, scornful, bitter and conscientious. Tall, with a handsome figure, a fine, thoughtful face with a long, blond moustache and disenchanted blue eyes, exquisitely courteous, a conversationalist such as we had never heard before, he was in the eyes of my family, who always cited him as an example, the epitome of the superior man, approaching life in the noblest and most delicate way. My grandmother reproached him only for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not having the same naturalness in his language as in his loosely knotted lavalliere bowties, in his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was also surprised by the fiery tirades he often launched against the aristocracy, against fashionable life, against snobbery, 'certainly the sin which Saint Paul has in mind when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness'. Worldly ambition was a sentiment that my grandmother was so incapable of feeling or even, almost, of understanding, that it seemed to her quite pointless to bring so much ardour to stigmatizing it. What was more, she did not think it in very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister near Balbec was married to a titled gentleman of Lower Normandy, should indulge himself in such violent attacks against the nobility, going so far as to reproach the Revolution for not having had them all guillotined. 'Greetings, my friends! he would say, coming up to us. How fortunate you are to be able to stay here so much of the time; tomorrow I have to return to Paris, to my niche. 'Oh! he would add, with his own particular smile, gently ironical, disappointed and slightly distracted, of course my house contains every useless thing in the world. It lacks only the one essential, a large piece of sky like this one. Always try to keep a piece of sky over your life, little boy, he would add, turning to me. You have a lovely soul, of a rare quality, an artist's nature, don't ever let it go without what it needs. When we returned home and my aunt sent to ask us if Mme Goupil had been late coming in to Mass, we could not give her any information. Instead, we increased her disturbance by telling her there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Francoise, sent immediately to the grocery, came back empty-handed owing to the absence of Theodore, whose two professions, that of chorister with a part in the upkeep of the church and of grocer's assistant, gave him connections in all worlds and therefore knowledge that was universal. 'Ah! sighed my aunt, I wish it were time for Eulalie. She's really the only one who will be able to tell me. Eulalie was a deaf and energetic spinster with a limp who had 'retired' after the death of Mme de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service since her childhood, and had then taken a room next to the church, descending from it constantly either for the services or, when there was no service, to say a little prayer or give Theodore a hand; the rest of the time she visited sick people like my Aunt Leonie, to whom she would describe what had happened at Mass or at Vespers. She was not above adding some revenue to the small pension paid her by the family of her former employers by going from time to time to look after the cure's linen or that of some other prominent personality in Combray's clerical world. Above a cloak of black cloth she wore a small white hood almost like a nun's, and a skin disease gave parts of her cheeks and her hooked nose the bright pink tones of an impatience flower. Her visits were the great diversion of my Aunt Leonie, who hardly received anyone else now, apart from M. le Cure. My aunt had gradually eliminated all the other visitors because they all made the mistake, in her eyes, of belonging to one or the other of two categories of people whom she detested. One group, the worst, whom she had got rid of first, were the ones who advised her not to 'coddle' herself and subscribed, if only negatively and showing it only by certain disapproving silences or by certain dubious smiles, to the subversive doctrine that a little walk in the sun and a good rare beefsteak (whereas two wretched sips of Vichy water would lie on her stomach for fourteen hours!) would do her more good than her bed and her medicines. The other category was made up of the people who seemed to believe she was more seriously ill than she thought, that she was as seriously ill as she said she was. And so, those she had allowed to come up after some hesitation and upon Francoise's kindly meant entreaties and who, in the course of their visit, had shown how very unworthy they were of the favour being done them by timidly risking a 'Don't you think that if you were to move about a little when the weather's fine,' or who, on the contrary, when she said to them: 'I'm very low, very low, this is the end, my poor friends,' answered her: 'Ah! when our health fails us! Still, you may last a while longer yet as you are' these, the former as well as the latter, were certain never to be received again. And if Francoise was amused by my aunt's horrified look when from her bed she saw one of these people in the rue du Saint-Esprit appearing to come towards her house or when she heard the doorbell ring, she would laugh more heartily still, and as though at a good trick, at my aunt's ever-victorious ruses for managing to have them turned away, and at their discomfited expressions as they went off without having seen her, and at heart admired her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these people since she did not want to receive them. In short, my aunt required that her visitors at the same time commend her on her regimen, commiserate with her for her sufferings and encourage her as to her future. This was where Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute: 'This is the end, my poor Eulalie,' twenty times Eulalie would answer: 'Knowing your illness as you know it, Madame Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme Sazerin was saying to me just yesterday.' (One of Eulalie's firmest beliefs, which the impressive number of denials contributed by experience had not been enough to shake, was that Mme Sazerat's name was Mme Sazerin.) 'I am not asking to live to a hundred,' answered my aunt, who preferred not to see her days assigned a precise term. And since along with this Eulalie knew better than anyone else how to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday, barring an unforeseen obstacle, were for my aunt a pleasure, the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state that was at first pleasant, but quite soon painful like an excessive hunger, if Eulalie was even a little late. Too prolonged, this ecstasy of waiting for Eulalie became a torment, my aunt looked constantly at the time, yawned, felt faint. The sound of Eulalie's ring, if it came at the very end of the day, when she no longer expected it, would almost make her ill. The fact was that on Sunday, she thought only of this visit and, as soon as lunch was finished, Francoise would be in a hurry for us to leave the dining-room so that she could go up and 'occupy' my aunt. But (especially once the fine weather settled in at Combray) a good long time would go by after the haughty hour of noon, descending from the Saint-Hilaire steeple, which it had emblazoned with the twelve momentary rosettes of its sonorous crown, had echoed around our table close to the consecrated bread which had also come in, familiarly, after church, and we would still be sitting in front of the Thousand and One Nights plates, oppressed by the heat and especially by the meal. For, upon a permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, jams, biscuits which she no longer even announced to us, Francoise would add",3.7460537248895633,1.2594996380389398,0.43631392095136656,0.05151856324223234,4.368566685113448,4.0,2.4004858606752615,41.06818181818182,32.5,31.452271002896904,1.2977310459324847,1.0,0.6510052238559436,1807,716,0.39623685666851133,8190,44,62.42952387719298,1.2965752515068514e+27,6.236533196281151e+23,0.7971506728682407,0.7849892477194468,55.36274896865726,15.739817251094234,12.602617957971052,19.10574533380289,19.68003999597525,9.166419479800776,59.717877446294715,7.659090909090909,True,1097.0,0.8768638768638769,3.9393939393939394,2079.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0038038038038038036,0.0038038038038038036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006006006006006006,0.0,0.0,0.006253006253006253,15,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"depending on the labours in the fields and orchards, the fruit of the tide, the luck of the market-place, the kindness of neighbours and her own genius, and with the result that our menu, like the quatrefoils carved on the portals of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected somewhat the rhythm of the seasons and the incidents of daily life : a brill because the monger had guaranteed her that it was fresh, a turkey hen because she had seen a large one at the Roussainville-le-Pin market, cardoons with marrow because she had not made them for us that way before, a roast leg of mutton because fresh air whets the appetite and it would have plenty of time to 'descend' in the next seven hours, spinach for a change, apricots because they were still uncommon, gooseberries because in two weeks there would not be any more, raspberries that M. Swann had brought especially, cherries, the first that had come from the cherry tree in the garden after two years in which it had not given any, cream cheese, which I liked very much at one time, an almond cake because she had ordered it the day before, a brioche because it was our turn to present it. When all of that was finished, there came a work of art composed expressly for us, but more particularly dedicated to my father who was so fond of it, a chocolate custard, the product of Francoise's personal inspiration and attention, ephemeral and light as an occasional piece into which she had put all her talent. If anyone had refused to taste it, saying: 'I'm finished, I'm not hungry any more,' that person would immediately have been relegated to the rank of those barbarians who, even in a gift an artist makes them of one of his works, scrutinize its weight and its material when the only things of value in it are its intention and its signature. To leave even a single drop of it on the plate would have been to display the same impoliteness as to stand up before the end of a piece under the very nose of the composer. At last my mother would say to me: 'Now, don't stay here all day, go up to your room if you're too hot outdoors, but get a little fresh air first so that you don't start reading right after leaving the table.' I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, often ornamented, like a Gothic font, with a salamander which sculpted on the rough stone the mobile relief of its allegorical tapering body, on the backless bench shaded by a lilac, in the little corner of the garden that opened through a service gate on to the rue du Saint-Esprit and from whose untended earth the scullery rose by two steps, projecting from the house like an independent structure. One could see its red paving-stones gleaming like porphyry. It looked not so much like Francoise's lair as a little temple of Venus. It overflowed with the offerings of the dairyman, the fruit man, the vegetable monger, who had come sometimes from fairly remote hamlets to dedicate to it the first fruits of their fields. And its roof was forever crowned with the coocooing of a dove. In earlier years I did not linger in the sacred grove surrounding it, since, before going upstairs to read, I would enter the little sitting-room that my Uncle Adolphe, a brother of my grandfather's and a veteran who had retired with the rank of major, occupied on the ground floor, and which, even when its open windows let in the heat, if not the rays of the sun, which seldom reached that far, gave off inexhaustibly that dark cool smell, of both forest and ancien regime, that makes your nostrils linger in a daydream when you venture into certain abandoned hunting lodges. But for a number of years now I had not gone into my Uncle Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray because of a quarrel that had occurred between him and my family, through my fault, in the following circumstances: Once or twice a month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a visit, as he was finishing lunch, dressed in a plain jacket, waited on by his servant dressed in a work jacket of violet-and-white-striped drill. He would complain that I had not come for a long time, grumble that we were abandoning him; he would offer me a marzipan cake or a tangerine, we would pass through a drawing-room in which no one ever stopped, where no one ever made a fire, whose walls were ornamented with gilded mouldings, its ceilings painted with a blue that was meant to imitate the sky and its furniture upholstered in satin as at my grandparents', but yellow; then we would go on into what he called his 'study', whose walls were hung with some of those engravings depicting, against a dark background, a fleshy pink goddess driving a chariot, standing on a globe, or wearing a star on her forehead, which were admired during the Second Empire5 because they were felt to have a Pompeiian look about them, were then hated, and are beginning to be admired again for one reason and one only, despite the others that are given, and that is that they have such a Second-Empire look about them. And I would stay with my uncle until his valet came to him from the coachman to ask what time the latter should harness up. My uncle would then sink into a deep meditation while his admiring valet, afraid of disturbing him by the slightest movement, waited curiously for the result, which was always identical. At last, after the greatest hesitation, my uncle would unfailingly utter these words: 'At quarter past two,' which the valet would repeat with surprise, but without disputing them: 'At quarter past two? Very good... I'll go and tell him...' In those days I loved the theatre, with a platonic love, for my parents had not yet allowed me to enter a theatre, and I pictured to myself so inaccurately the pleasures one might experience there that I was not far from believing that each spectator looked as though into a stereoscope at a scene that was for him alone, though similar to the thousand others being looked at, each one for himself, by the rest of the spectators. Every morning I would run to the Morris column6 to see what shows were being announced. Nothing could have been more disinterested or happier than the daydreams inspired in my imagination by each play that was announced, daydreams conditioned by the images inseparable from the words that made up its title and also by the colour of the posters, still damp and blistered with paste, against which the title appeared. Except for those strange works like Le Testament de Cesar Girodot or Oedipe-Roi, which were inscribed, not on the green poster of the Opera-Comique, but on the wine-red poster of the Comedie-Francaise, nothing seemed to me more different from the sparkling white plume of Les Diamants de la Couronne than the smooth, mysterious satin of Le Domino Noir,7 and, since my parents had told me that when I went to the theatre for the first time I would have to choose between these two plays, as I tried to study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other, since this was all I knew of them, so as to attempt to discern the pleasure each one promised me and compare it to the pleasure that lay concealed within the other, I managed to picture to myself so forcefully, on the one hand a play that was dazzling and proud, on the other a play that was soft and velvety, that I was as incapable of deciding which I would prefer as if, for dessert, I had been given the choice between rice a l'Imperatrice and chocolate custard. All my conversations with my friends concerned these actors whose art, though unknown to me, was the first form, of all those it assumes, in which Art allowed me a presentiment of what it was. Between the manner in which one actor and another delivered, nuanced a declamatory speech, the tiniest differences seemed to me to have an incalculable importance. And I would rank them in order of talent, according to what I had been told about them, in lists that I recited to myself all day long, and that in the end hardened in my brain and obstructed it with their immovability. Later, when I was in school, each time I wrote to a new friend during class as soon as the teacher' head was turned, my first question was always whether he had been to the theatre yet and whether he thought the greatest actor really was Got, the second-best Delaunay, etc. And if, in his opinion, Febvre came only after Thiron, or Delaunay only after Coquelin, the sudden mobility that Coquelin, losing his stony rigidity, would develop in my mind in order to pass to second place, and the miraculous agility, the fecund animation with which Delaunay would be endowed in order to withdraw to fourth, would restore the sensation of flowering and life to my newly supple and fertilized brain. But if the actors preoccupied me so, if the sight of Maubaut coming out of the Theatre-Francais one afternoon had filled me with the ecstasy and suffering of love, how much more did the name of a star blazing on the door of a theatre, how much more did the sight, at the window of a brougham passing in the street, its horses blossoming with roses in their headbands, of a woman I thought might be an actress, leave me in a state of prolonged disturbance, as I tried impotently and painfully to imagine her life! I would rank the most illustrious in order of talent, Sarah Bernhardt, La Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary, but all of them interested me. Now my uncle knew many of them and also some courtesans whom I did not distinguish clearly from the actresses. He would entertain them at home. And if we went to see him only on certain days, that was because on the other days women came whom his family could not have met, or so at least they thought, since my uncle himself, on the contrary, was only too ready to pay pretty widows who had perhaps never been married, and countesses with high-sounding names which were doubtless only assumed names, the courtesy of introducing them to my grandmother or even of presenting them with some of the family jewels, tendencies",3.8145149959405407,1.4047276772886879,0.4492908628765083,0.05626866202262379,4.374793615850303,4.0,2.370215749871492,56.78125,39.0,52.27077001955777,1.2927903137039076,1.0,0.6348161140711391,1817,722,0.39735828288387454,8214,32,65.6516766334718,3.252077521946975e+28,1.584833100364023e+25,0.8013082031280764,0.7960285067558288,39.83197071064943,21.80961320170611,13.81666964889586,25.178102641717118,27.56590293065492,9.402487616951017,75.21823403962576,10.46875,True,1111.0,0.8908382066276803,4.002923976608187,2052.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012782105052925903,0.008987417615338526,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008388256440982624,0.003195526263231476,0.0,0.009259259259259259,16,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"And not wanting to stop my reading, I would go and continue it in the garden, at least, under the chestnut tree, in a little hooded chair of wicker and canvas, in the depths of which I would sit and think I was hidden from the eyes of the people who might come and pay a visit to my parents. And wasn't my mind also like another crib in the depths of which I felt I remained ensconced, even in order to watch what was happening outside? When I saw an exterior object, my awareness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, edging it with a thin spiritual border that prevented me from ever directly touching its substance; it would dissipate somehow before I could make contact with it, just as an incandescent body brought near a damp object never touches its wetness because it is always preceded by a zone of evaporation. In the sort of screen dappled with different states of mind which my consciousness would unfold at the same time that I was reading, and which ranged from aspirations hidden most deeply in myself to the completely exterior vision of the horizon that I had, at the bottom of the garden, before my eyes, what was first in me, innermost, the constantly moving handle that controlled the rest, was my belief in the philosophical richness and the beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate them for myself, whatever that book might be. For, even if I had bought it in Combray, having seen it in front of Borange's grocery, which was too far away from the house for Francoise to be able to do her shopping there as she did at Camus's, but which was better stocked as stationer and bookshop, held in place by some strings in the mosaic of pamphlets and monthly serials that covered the two panels of its door, which was itself more mysterious, more sown with ideas than the door of a cathedral, the fact was that I had recognized it as having been mentioned to me as a remarkable work by the teacher or friend who appeared to me at that period to hold the secret of the truth and beauty half sensed, half incomprehensible, the knowledge of which was the goal, vague but permanent, of my thoughts. After this central belief, which moved incessantly during my reading from inside to outside, towards the discovery of the truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which I was taking part, for those afternoons contained more dramatic events than does, often, an entire lifetime. These were the events taking place in the book I was reading; it is true that the people affected by them were not 'real', as Francoise said. But all the feelings we are made to experience by the joy or the misfortune of a real person are produced in us only through the intermediary of an image of that joy or that misfortune; the ingeniousness of the first novelist consisted in understanding that in the apparatus of our emotions, the image being the only essential element, the simplification that would consist in purely and simply abolishing real people would be a decisive improvement. A real human being, however profoundly we sympathize with him, in large part is perceived by our senses, that is to say, remains opaque to us, offers a dead weight that our sensibilities cannot lift. If a calamity should strike him, it is only in a small part of the total notion we have of him that we will be able to be moved by this, even more, it is only in a part of the total notion he has of himself that he will be able to be moved himself. The novelist's happy discovery was to have the idea of replacing these parts, impenetrable to the soul, by an equal quantity of immaterial parts, that is to say, parts which our soul can assimilate. What does it matter, thenceforth, if the actions, the emotions of this new order of creatures seem to us true, since we have made them ours, since it is within us that they occur, that they hold sway, as we feverishly turn the pages of the book, over the rapidity of our breathing and the intensity of our gaze. And once the novelist has put us in that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is multiplied tenfold, in which his book will disturb us as might a dream but a dream more lucid than those we have while sleeping and one whose memory will last longer, then see how, for the space of an hour, he sets loose in us all possible happinesses and all possible unhappinesses, just a few of which we would spend years of our lives coming to know and the most intense of which would never be revealed to us because the slowness with which they occur prevents us from perceiving them; (thus our heart changes, in life, and it is the worst pain; but we know it only through reading, through our imagination: in reality it changes, as certain phenomena of nature occur, slowly enough so that, even if we are able to observe successively each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change). Already less interior to my body than these lives of the characters, next came, half projected in front of me, the landscape in which the action unfolded and which exerted on my thoughts a much greater influence than the other, than the one I had before my eyes when I lifted them from the book. It was thus that during two summers, in the heat of the garden at Combray, I felt, because of the book I was reading then, homesick for a mountainous and fluvial country, where I would see many sawmills and where, in the depths of the clear water, pieces of wood rotted under tufts of watercress: not far off, climbing along low walls, were clusters of violet and reddish flowers. And since the dream of a woman who would love me was always present in my mind, during those summers that dream was impregnated with the coolness of the running waters; and whichever the woman I conjured up, clusters of violet and reddish flowers would rise immediately on either side of her like complementary colours. This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever stamped, is adorned and enriched, by the glimmer of the colours not its own that may happen to surround it in our daydream; for the landscapes in the books I read were for me not merely landscapes more vividly portrayed in my imagination than those which Combray set before my eyes but otherwise analogous. Because the author had chosen them, because of the faith with which my mind went to meet his word as though it were a revelation, they seemed to be an impression hardly ever given me by the countryside in which I happened to be, and especially by our garden, the unmagical product of the perfectly correct conception of the gardener so despised by my grandmother an actual part of Nature itself, worthy to be studied and explored. If my parents had allowed me, when I was reading a book, to go to visit the region it described, I would have believed I was taking an invaluable step forward in the conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always surrounded by our own soul, it is not as though by a motionless prison: rather, we are in some sense borne along with it in a perpetual leap to go beyond it, to reach the outside, with a sort of discouragement as we hear around us always that same resonance, which is not an echo from outside but the resounding of an internal vibration. We try to rediscover in things, now precious because of it, the glimmer that our soul projected on them, we are disappointed to find that they seem to lack in nature the charm they derived in our thoughts from the proximity of certain ideas; at times we convert all the forces of that soul into cunning, into magnificence, in order to have an effect on people who are outside us, as we are well aware, and whom we will never reach. Thus, if I always imagined the woman I loved surrounded by the places I longed for most at that time, if I would have liked her to be the one who took me to visit them, who opened the way for me into an unknown world, it was not because of a simple chance association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments which I am separating artificially today as if I were cutting sections at different heights of an apparently motionless iridescent jet of water in a single inflexible upsurge of all the forces of my life. Lastly, continuing to trace from the inside to the outside these states simultaneously juxtaposed in my consciousness, and before reaching the real horizon that enveloped them, I find pleasures of another kind, the pleasure of being comfortably seated, of smelling the good scent of the air, of not being disturbed by a visit; and, when an hour rang in the belltower of Saint-Hilaire, of seeing fall piece by piece what was already consumed of the afternoon, until I heard the last stroke, which allowed me to add up the total and after which the long silence that followed it seemed to commence in the blue sky that whole part that was still granted me for reading until the good dinner which Francoise was preparing and which would restore me from the hardships I had incurred, during the reading of the book, in pursuit of its hero. And at each hour it would seem to me only a few moments since the preceding hour had rung; the most recent would come and inscribe itself close to the other in the sky, and I would not be able to believe that sixty minutes were held in that little blue arc comprised between their two marks of gold. Sometimes, even, this premature hour would ring two strokes more than the last; there was therefore one that I had not heard, something that had taken place had not taken place for me; the interest of the reading, as magical as a deep sleep, had deceived my hallucinated ears and erased the golden bell from the azure surface of the silence.

"which had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, when an actres's name came into the conversation, I would hear my father say to my mother, smiling: 'A friend of your uncle's'; and I would think that the novitiate pointlessly endured for perhaps years on end by eminent men at the door of some woman who would not answer their letters and would ask her doorman to turn them away could have been spared a boy like me by my uncle, who could introduce him in his own home to the actress who, unapproachable by so many others, was for him an intimate friend. And so using the excuse that a lesson which had been moved now came at such an awkward hour that it had prevented me several times and would continue to prevent me from seeing my uncle one day, different from the day set apart for the visits we made to him, taking advantage of the fact that my parents had had lunch early, I went out and, instead of going to look at the column of posters, for which I was allowed to go out alone, I ran to him. I noticed in front of his door a carriage with two horses, each of which had a red carnation at its blinkers, as did the coachman in his buttonhole. From the staircase I heard a laugh and a woman' voice, and, as soon as I rang, a silence, then the sound of doors being shut. The valet came to open the door, and when he saw me seemed embarrassed, told me my uncle was very busy, probably would not be able to see me and when he went to let him know anyway, the same voice I had heard before said: 'Oh, yes! do let him come in; just for a minute, I would enjoy it so much. In the photograph you have on your desk, he looks so much like his mother, your niece; that' her photograph next to his, isn't it? I would so like to see him, just for a moment, I would so like to see the boy. I heard my uncle grumble, become cross, finally the valet showed me in. On the table, there was the same plate of marzipan as always; my uncle had on his usual jacket, but across from him, in a pink silk dress with a long string of pearls around her neck, sat a young woman who was eating the last of a tangerine. My uncertainty as to whether I should call her Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush and, not daring to turn my eyes too much in her direction for fear of having to talk to her, I went to kiss my uncle. She looked at me, smiling, my uncle said to her: 'My nephew,' without telling her my name, or telling me hers, probably because, ever since the difficulties he had had with my grandfather, he had been trying as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this sort of acquaintance. How much like his mother he is, she said. But you've never seen my niece except in a photograph, said my uncle brusquely. I beg your pardon, my dear friend, I passed her on the stairs last year when you were so ill. It' true that I saw her for only a split second and your stairs are quite dark, but that was enough for me to admire her. This young man has her beautiful eyes and also that, she said, drawing a line with her finger along the lower part of her forehead. Does Madame, your niece, have the same name as you, my dear? she asked my uncle. He looks like his father more than anyone, muttered my uncle, who was no more anxious to introduce them at a distance by saying Mama' name than to do so at close quarters. 'He is exactly like his father and also my poor mother. I don't know his father, said the lady in pink with a slight inclination of her head, and I never knew your poor mother, my dear. You remember, it was shortly after your bereavement that we met. I was feeling a little disappointed, because this young lady was no different from the other pretty women I had sometimes seen in my family, in particular the daughter of a cousin of ours to whose house I went every year on the 1st of January. Better dressed, only, my uncle' friend had the same quick and kind glance, she seemed as open and affectionate. In her I found no trace of the theatrical appearance that I admired in photographs of actresses, nor of the diabolical expression that would have suited the life she must lead. I had trouble believing she was a courtesan and I especially would not have believed she was a stylish courtesan, if I had not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearl necklace, if I had not known that my uncle was acquainted only with those of the highest sort. But I wondered how the millionaire who had given her her carriage and her house and her jewels could enjoy squandering his fortune on a person whose appearance was so simple and proper. And yet, as I thought about what her life must be like, the immorality of it disturbed me perhaps more than if it had taken concrete form before my eyes in some special guise it was so invisible, like the secret of some romantic story, of some scandal which had driven out of the home of her bourgeois parents and consigned to the public, which had brought to a bloom of beauty and raised to the demi-monde and to notoriety, this woman, the play of whose features, the intonations of whose voice, the same as so many others I knew already, made me consider her despite myself to be a young woman from a good family, though she was no longer from any family. We had gone into the 'study', and my uncle, appearing somewhat ill at ease because of my presence, offered her a cigarette. No, she said, my dear, you know I've become used to the ones the grand-duke sends me. I told him you were jealous. And from a case she drew cigarettes covered with gilded foreign writing. 'Why yes, she added abruptly, I must have met this young man' father at your house. Isn't he your nephew? How could I have forgotten it? He was so good, so exquisite to me,' she said modestly and sensitively. But as I thought about what might have been my father' rude greeting which she said she had found so exquisite, I, who knew his reserve and his coldness, was embarrassed, as by an indelicacy he had committed, by this disparity between the excessive gratitude that was bestowed on him and his insufficient friendliness. It seemed to me later that it was one of the touching aspects of the role of these idle and studious women that they devote their generosity, their talent, a free-floating dream of beauty in love for, like artists, they do not carry it to fruition, do not bring it into the framework of a shared existence and a gold that costs them little, to enrich with a precious and refined setting the rough and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was wearing a jacket to receive her, with her gentle person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, the elegance emanating from the friendship of a grand-duke, so in the same way she had taken some insignificant remark of my father', had worked it delicately, turned it, given it a precious appellation, and enchasing it with one of her glances of the finest water, tinged with humility and gratitude, had given it back changed into an artistic jewel, into something 'completely exquisite'. Come now, it' time for you to go, my uncle said to me. I stood up, I had an irresistible desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but it seemed to me this would have been something as bold as an abduction. My heart pounded as I said to myself: 'Should I do it, should I not do it,' then I stopped asking myself what I should do so as to be able to do something. And with a blind and senseless gesture divested of all the reasons I had found in its favour a moment ago, I carried to my lips the hand she was holding out to me. How nice he is! How gallant! Why, the boy' a bit of a ladies' man already: he takes after his uncle. He'll be a perfect gentleman,8 she added, clenching her teeth to give the phrase a slightly British accent. Couldn't he come have a cup of tea with me sometime, as our neighbours the English say? He need only send me a 'blue'9 in the morning. I did not know what a 'blue' was. I did not understand half the words the lady said, but my fear that there was some question concealed in them which it would have been impolite of me not to answer made me keep on listening to them with close attention, and this made me very tired. Oh no, that's not possible, said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders, he's very busy, he works hard. He wins all the prizes at school, he added in a low voice so that I would not hear this lie and contradict it. Who knows? Perhaps the boy will be a little Victor Hugo, another Vaulabelle,10 you know. I adore artists, answered the lady in pink, they're the only ones who understand women... Besides a few superior creatures like you. Excuse my ignorance, my dear, but who is Vaulabelle? Is it those gilt-edged volumes in the little glass bookcase in your sitting room? You know you promised to lend them to me, I'll take great care of them. My uncle, who hated lending his books, said nothing in answer and took me to the front hall. Crazed with love for the lady in pink, I covered my old uncle's tobacco-filled cheeks with mad kisses, and, while with some embarrassment he let me know without venturing to tell me openly that he would just as soon I not talk about this visit to my parents, I said to him, tears in my eyes, that the memory of his goodness was so powerful within me that one day I would certainly find the means to show him my gratitude. It was so powerful, in fact, that two hours later, after a few mysterious phrases that did not",2.969327724614103,0.9610377064969822,0.4421521482007885,0.07280323497405075,4.075221238938053,4.0,2.2535333504682824,27.815384615384616,18.0,25.490204639123213,1.2400442477876106,1.0,0.5759854946763255,1808,621,0.3434734513274336,7672,65,67.09620543619369,1.378833344896739e+29,6.622638544172618e+25,0.7628290925640613,0.7424243726427593,73.69464125255278,9.890522123893806,9.925550702671664,13.161552076242343,11.671984343090536,7.098141592920353,41.75343771272975,3.876923076923077,True,1145.0,0.8756003842459174,3.6849183477425553,2082.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021642736486486486,0.0046452702702702705,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013513513513513514,0.004750844594594595,0.006756756756756757,0.0033621517771373678,17,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"seem to me to give my parents a distinct enough idea of the new importance with which I was endowed, I found it more explicit to describe to them every last detail of the visit I had just paid. I did not think that in doing this I was causing problems for my uncle. How could I have thought that, since I did not want that? And I could not imagine that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I saw none. Doesn't it happen every day that a friend asks us to be sure to apologize for him to a woman to whom he has been prevented from writing, and that we neglect to do it, feeling that this person cannot attach any importance to a silence that has none for us? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brain of another person was an inert and docile receptacle, without the power to react specifically to what one introduced into it; and I did not doubt that in depositing in my parents' brains the news of the acquaintance I had made through my uncle, I was transmitting to them at the same time, as I wished to, the kindly opinion that I had of this introduction. My parents unfortunately deferred to principles entirely different from those I was suggesting they adopt, when they wished to appraise my uncle's action. My father and grandfather had some violent arguments with him; of this, I was indirectly informed. A few days later, encountering my uncle outdoors as he was passing in an open carriage, I was filled with all the pain, the gratitude, the remorse that I would have liked to express to him. Compared to their immensity, I felt that raising my hat would be shabby and might make my uncle think I did not believe I owed him more than an ordinary sort of courtesy. I decided to refrain from that inadequate gesture and I turned my head away. My uncle thought that in doing this I was following my parents' orders, he did not forgive them, and he died many years later without any of us ever seeing him again. And so I no longer went into my Uncle Adolphe's sitting-room, now closed, and would linger in the vicinity of the scullery until Francoise emerged from her temple into the yard and said to me: 'I'm going to let my kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water, I must fly to Mme Octave,' when I would decide to go back in and would go straight upstairs to read in my room. The kitchen-maid was an abstract entity, a permanent institution whose invariable set of attributes assured her a sort of continuity and identity, through the succession of temporary forms in which she was incarnated, for we never had the same one two years running. The year we ate so much asparagus, the kitchen-maid usually given the job of 'scraping' them was a poor, sickly creature, in a state of pregnancy already rather advanced when we arrived at Easter, and we were in fact surprised that Francoise allowed her to do so many errands and so much heavy work, for she was beginning to have difficulty carrying before her the mysterious basket, rounder every day, whose magnificent form one could divine under her ample smocks. These smocks reminded me of the cloaks worn by certain of Giotto's symbolic figures, photographs of whom I had been given by M. Swann. He himself was the one who had pointed this out to us and when he asked for news of the kitchen-maid he would say: 'How is Giotto's Charity?' What was more, she herself, poor girl, fattened by her pregnancy even in her face, even in her cheeks, which descended straight and square, rather resembled, in fact, those strong, mannish virgins, matrons really, in whom the virtues are personified in the Arena. And I realize now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua11 resembled her in still another way. Just as the image of this girl was increased by the added symbol she carried before her belly without appearing to understand its meaning, without expressing in her face anything of its beauty and spirit, as a mere heavy burden, in the same way the powerful housewife who is represented at the Arena below the name 'Caritas', and a reproduction of whom hung on the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, embodies this virtue without seeming to suspect it, without any thought of charity seeming ever to have been capable of being expressed by her vulgar, energetic face. Through a lovely invention of the painter, she is trampling upon the treasures of the earth, but absolutely as if she were treading grapes to extract their juice or rather as she would have climbed on some sacks to raise herself up; and she holds out to God her flaming heart, or, to put it more exactly, she 'hands' it to him, as a cook hands a corkscrew through the skylight of her cellar to someone who is asking her for it at the ground-floor window. Envy, too, might have had more of a particular expression of envy. But in this fresco too, the symbol occupies such a large place and is represented as so real, the serpent hissing at the lips of Envy is so fat, it fills her wide-open mouth so completely, that the muscles of her face are distended to contain it, like those of a child swelling a balloon with its breath, and that Envy's attention and ours along with it entirely concentrated as it is on the action of her lips, has scarcely any time for envious thoughts. Despite all the admiration M. Swann professed for these figures of Giotto, for a long time I took no pleasure in contemplating, in our schoolroom, where the copies he had brought back to me had been hung, this Charity without charity, this Envy which looked like nothing more than a plate in a medical book illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour of the tongue or by the introduction of the operating surgeon's instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular face was the very same which, in Combray, characterized certain pretty, pious and unfeeling bourgeois ladies I saw at Mass, some of whom had long since been enrolled in the reserve militia of Injustice. But later I understood that the startling strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes was due to the large place which the symbol occupied in them, and the fact that it was represented, not as a symbol, since the thought symbolized was not expressed, but as real, as actually experienced or physically handled, gave something more literal and more precise to the meaning of the work, something more concrete and more striking to the lesson it taught. In the case of the poor kitchen-maid, too, wasn't one's attention constantly brought back to her belly by the weight that pulled on it; and in the same way, also, the thoughts of the dying are quite often turned towards the aspect of death that is real, painful, dark, visceral, towards the underside of death, which is in fact the side it presents to them and so harshly makes them feel, and which more closely resembles a crushing burden, a difficulty breathing, a need to drink, than what we call the idea of death. There must have been in those Virtues and Vices of Padua a good deal of reality, since they appeared to me as alive as the pregnant servant, and since she herself did not seem to me much less allegorical. And perhaps this (at least apparent) non-participation of a person's soul in the virtue that is acting through her has also, beyond its aesthetic value, a reality that is, if not psychological, at least, as they say, physiognomical. When, later I had occasion to meet, in the course of my life, in convents for instance, truly saintly embodiments of practical charity, they generally had the cheerful, positive, indifferent and brusque air of a busy surgeon, the sort of face in which one can read no commiseration, no pity in the presence of human suffering, no fear of offending it, the sort which is the ungentle face, the antipathetic and sublime face of true goodness. While the kitchen-maid involuntarily causing Francoise's superiority to shine forth, just as Error, by contrast, renders more dazzling the triumph of Truth served coffee which according to Mama was merely hot water, and then took up to our rooms hot water which was barely lukewarm, I had lain down on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which tremulously protected its frail transparent coolness from the afternoon sun behind its nearly closed shutters, through which a gleam of daylight had nonetheless contrived to pass its yellow wings and remained motionless between the wood and the window-pane, in a corner, like a poised butterfly. It was barely light enough to read, and the sensation of the splendid brightness of the day came to me only from the blows struck in the rue de la Cure by Camus (told by Francoise that my aunt was 'not resting' and that one could make noise) against some dusty crates, which, however, reverberating in the sonorous atmosphere peculiar to hot weather, seemed to send scarlet stars flying into the distance; and also by the houseflies that performed for me, in a little concert, a sort of chamber music of summer: this music does not evoke summer in the same way as a melody of human music, which, when you happen to hear it during the warm season, afterwards reminds you of it; it is connected to the summer by a more necessary bond: born of the fine days, born again only with them, containing a little of their essence, it not only awakens their image in our memory, it guarantees their return, their presence, actual, ambient, immediately accessible. This dim coolness of my room was to the full sun of the street what a shadow is to a ray of light, that is to say, it was just as luminous and offered my imagination the full spectacle of summer, which my senses, had I been out walking, could have enjoyed only piecemeal; and so it was quite in harmony with my repose, which (because of the stirring adventures narrated in my books) sustained, like the repose of an unmoving hand in the midst of a stream of water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity. But my grandmother, even if the hot weather had turned bad, if a storm or merely a squall had arisen, would come and beg me to go out.",3.8510303049970425,0.889398175235364,0.4362240029547345,0.05698038212081603,4.3938223938223935,4.0,2.4728878244664214,54.93939393939394,39.0,37.690075370724216,1.3287369001654716,1.0,0.6815157854800247,1813,710,0.39161610590182017,8224,33,67.1524329389916,1.4585827457337798e+29,7.0908252101788034e+25,0.8764198031276464,0.8833322121251014,38.66037339751628,21.5154590583162,14.597789272814204,24.91012051012051,26.73460044460044,9.496900165471587,75.6785003927861,11.393939393939394,True,1104.0,0.8872143898881867,3.9980554205153136,2057.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009976057462090982,0.004788507581803671,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01137270550678372,0.007182761372705506,0.004788507581803671,0.002916869227029655,18,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"emptied by me of the ordinary incidents of my own existence, which I had replaced by a life of foreign adventures and foreign aspirations in the heart of a country washed by running waters, you still evoke that life for me when I think of you and you contain it in fact from having gradually encircled and enclosed it while I went on with my reading in the falling heat of the day in the crystalline succession, slowly changing and spanned by leafy branches, of your silent, sonorous, redolent and limpid hours. I was sometimes dragged away from my reading, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener's daughter, who would run like a lunatic, overturning an orange tree in its tub as she went by, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth and shouting, 'They're coming, they're coming!' so that Francoise and I should run out too and not miss any of the show. This was on the days when the regiment passed through Combray on its way to garrison manoeuvres, generally going down the rue de Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on chairs outside the railings, watched the people of Combray taking their Sunday walk and allowed themselves to be watched in turn, the gardener's daughter through a slit left between two distant houses in the avenue de la Gare had caught sight of the glitter of helmets. The servants had rushed to bring in their chairs, for when the cuirassiers paraded down the rue Sainte-Hildegarde, they filled its entire breadth, and the cantering horses grazed the houses, covering pavements submerged like banks that offer too narrow a bed to a torrent unleashed. Poor children, said Francoise, having barely reached the railings and already in tears; poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow; the very thought of it gives me a shock, she added, putting her hand on her heart, where she had received that shock. A fine sight, isn't it, Madame Francoise, all these youngsters with no care for their lives? said the gardener to get a 'rise' out of her. He had not spoken in vain: No care for their lives? Well, now, what should we care for if we don't care for our lives, the only gift the dear Lord never gives us twice over? Alas, dear God! It's quite true, though, they don't care! I saw them in '70; in those wretched wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing more nor less than madmen; and then they're not worth the rope to hang them with; they're not men any more, they're lions. (For Francoise, the comparison of a man to a lion, which she pronounced lie-on, was not at all complimentary.) The rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see anything coming from far off, and it was through that slit between the two houses in the avenue de la Gare that we saw more and more new helmets flowing and shining in the sun. The gardener wanted to know if there were many more still to come, and he was thirsty, because the sun was beating down. So, all of a sudden, his daughter, leaping out as though from a place besieged, would sally forth, gain the corner of the street, and after braving death a hundred times, come back to us bringing, along with a carafe of licorice water, the news that there were at least a thousand of them coming without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Meseglise. Francoise and the gardener, reconciled, would discuss what action should be taken in case of war. You see, Francoise, said the gardener, revolution would be better, because when they declare a revolution, it's only them that wants to that goes. Well now, at least I can understand that, it's more honest. The gardener believed that when war was declared they would stop all the railway trains. Of course! So we doesn't run off, said Francoise. And the gardener: 'Oh, they're clever ones!' because he would not admit that war was not a kind of bad trick that the State tried to play on the people, and that if only they had the means to do it, there was not a single person who would not have run away from it. But Francoise would hurry back to my aunt, I would return to my book, the servants would settle in front of the gate again to watch as the dust subsided along with the emotion roused by the soldiers. Long after calm had descended, an unaccustomed flow of people out walking would continue to darken the streets of Combray. And in front of each house, even those where it was not the custom, the servants or even the masters, sitting and watching, would festoon the sill with a border as dark and irregular as the border of sea-weed and shells whose crepe and embroidery are left on the shore by a strong tide after it recedes. Except on those days, however, I could usually read in peace. But the interruption and the commentary that a visit of Swann's once produced as I was in the midst of reading a book by an author quite new to me, Bergotte, had the consequence that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall adorned with spikes of violet flowers, but against a quite different background, before the portal of a Gothic cathedral, that the image now appeared of one of the women I dreamed of. I had heard Bergotte mentioned for the first time by a friend of mine older than I whom I greatly admired, Bloch. When he heard me admit how much I admired 'La Nuit d'Octobre',12 he had exploded in laughter as noisy as a trumpet and said to me: 'Beware this rather low fondness of yours for the Honourable de Musset. He's an extremely pernicious individual and a rather sinister brute. I must admit, however, that he and even our man Racine did, each of them, in the course of their lives, make one fairly rhythmical line of verse that also has in its favour what I believe to be the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. They are: 'La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camyre' and 'La fille de Minos et de Pasiphae.'13 They were pointed out to me in defence of those two rogues in an article by my very dear master, old Leconte, acceptable to the Immortal Gods. Speaking of which, here's a book I don't have time to read right now which is recommended, it seems, by that colossal fellow. I've been told he considers the author, the Honourable Bergotte, to be a most subtle individual; and even though he may evince, at times, a goodness of heart rather hard to explain, for me his word is a Delphic Oracle. Do read these lyrical pieces of prose, therefore, and if the titanic rhymester who composed 'Bhagavat' and 'Le Levrier de Magnus'14 has spoken the truth, by Apollo, you will taste, dear master, the nectarine joys of Olympos. ' It was in a sarcastic tone that he had asked me to call him 'dear master' and that he called me the same. But in reality we took a certain pleasure in this game, since we were still close to the age when one believes one creates what one names. Unfortunately, I was unable to talk to Bloch and ask him for an explanation in order to quiet the disturbance he had caused in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I expected nothing less than a revelation of the truth) were all the finer if they meant nothing at all. For Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first he had been made quite welcome. It was true that my grandfather claimed that each time I formed a closer attachment to one of my friends than the others and brought him home, he was always a Jew, which would not have displeased him in principle even his friend Swann was of Jewish extraction had he not felt that it was not from among the best that I had chosen him. And so when I brought home a new friend, he very seldom failed to hum: 'Oh God of our Fathers' from La Juive15 or 'Israel, break thy bond',16 singing only the tune, naturally (Ti la lam talam, talim), but I was afraid my friend would know it and restore the words. Before he saw them, simply from hearing the name, which quite often had nothing particularly Jewish about it, he would guess not only the Jewish background of those of my friends who were in fact Jewish, but even whatever might be distressing about their family. And what is the name of this friend of yours who's coming this evening? Dumont, Grandfather. Dumont! Oh, now I'm suspicious! And he would sing: Archers, faites bonne garde! Veillez sans treve et sans bruit;17 And after adroitly asking us a few more specific questions, he would cry out: 'On guard! On guard!' or, if it was the victim himself, already there, whom he had forced, by a subtle interrogation, unwittingly to confess his origins, then, to show us he no longer had any doubts, he would simply gaze at us while barely perceptibly humming: De ce timide Israelite Quoi, vous guidez ici les pas! Champs paternels, Hebron, douce vallee.19 or else: Oui je suis de la race elue.20 These little idiosyncrasies of my grandfather's did not imply any feeling of ill-will towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for other reasons. He had begun by irritating my father, who, noticing that he was wet, had said to him with lively interest: Why, Monsieur Bloch, what's the weather like? Has it been raining? I don't understand this at all, the barometer couldn't have been better. The only answer he had drawn from him had been this: Monsieur, I absolutely cannot tell you if it has been raining. I live so resolutely beyond physical contingencies that my senses do not bother to notify me of them. Why, my poor son, that friend of yours is an idiot, my father had said to me when Bloch had gone. My goodness! He can't even tell me what the weather's like! Why, nothing's more interesting than that! He's an imbecile. Then Bloch had displeased my grandmother because after lunch, when she said she was feeling a little indisposed, he had stifled a sob and wiped away a few tears. How can you tell me he's sincere, she said to me. He doesn't know me; unless he's out of his mind, of course. And finally he had annoyed everyone because, having",2.8637431521688312,1.021625415687703,0.42374144540023506,0.08103366234087805,4.260532150776053,4.0,2.287480373116248,23.736842105263158,17.0,19.76198398644054,1.2544345898004434,1.0,0.5729559848517002,1804,693,0.38414634146341464,8078,76,64.88048949971954,1.5039679205614834e+28,7.11432318146397e+24,0.6531671774356316,0.6321949307787912,76.6169389660404,8.469696580697867,9.206073818396264,11.40161045629595,10.505527482786789,8.004922394678491,40.92087758198156,4.078947368421052,True,1103.0,0.8708609271523179,3.8211920529801326,2114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010528447054059526,0.006276574205304718,0.006276574205304718,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005466693662684754,0.002733346831342377,0.0,0.01229895931882687,20,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"I wept over the writer's pages as though in the arms of a father I had found again. From his books, I imagined Bergotte to be a frail, disappointed old man who had lost several of his children and never recovered. And so I would read, I would sing his prose to myself, more dolce, more lento perhaps than it was written, and the simplest sentence spoke to me with a more tender intonation. Above all else I loved his philosophy, I had pledged myself over to it for life. It made me impatient to reach the age when I would enter secondary school and enroll in the class called Philosophy. But I did not want to do anything else there but live according to Bergotte's ideas exclusively, and, had I been told that the metaphysicians to whom I would be devoting myself by then would not resemble him at all, I would have felt the despair of a lover who wants his love to be lifelong and to whom one talks about the other mistresses he will have later. One Sunday, as I was reading in the garden, I was disturbed by Swann, who had come to see my parents. What are you reading? May I look? Well, well! Bergotte! Now, who told you about his books? I said it was Bloch. Ah, yes! The boy I saw here once, who looks so much like the portrait of Mohammed II by Bellini.23 Oh, it's quite striking! He has the same circumflex eyebrows, the same curved nose, the same jutting cheekbones. When he has a goatee, he'll be the same person. Well, he has good taste, in any case, because Bergotte is quite enchanting. And seeing how much I appeared to admire Bergotte, Swann, who never talked about the people he knew, out of kindness made an exception and said to me: I know him very well. If you would like him to write a few words in the front of your book, I could ask him. I did not dare accept his offer, but asked Swann some questions about Bergotte. 'Could you tell me which is his favourite actor?' Actor? I don't know. But I do know that he doesn't consider any man on the stage equal to La Berma; he puts her above everyone else. Have you seen her? No, Monsieur, my parents don't allow me to go to the theatre. That's unfortunate. You ought to ask them. La Berma in Phedre, in Le Cid,24 is only an actress, you might say, but you know, I'm not much of a believer in the 'hierarchy!' of the arts (and I noticed, as had often struck me in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters, that when he talked about serious things, when he used an expression that seemed to imply an opinion about an important subject, he took care to isolate it in a tone of voice that was particularly mechanical and ironic, as though he had put it between quotation marks, seeming not to want to take responsibility for it, as though saying: 'hierarchy, you know, as it is called by silly people?' But then if it was so silly, why did he say hierarchy?). A moment later, he added: 'It will give you as noble a vision as any masterpiece, I don't know, really... as and he began to laugh the Queens of Chartres!'25 Until then his horror of ever expressing a serious opinion had seemed to me a thing that must be elegant and Parisian and that was the opposite of the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters; and I also suspected it was a form of wit in the social circles in which Swann moved, where, in reaction to the lyricism of earlier generations, they went to an extreme in rehabilitating those small, precise facts formerly reputed to be vulgar, and proscribed 'fine phrases'. But now I found something shocking in this attitude of Swann's towards things. He appeared not to dare to have an opinion and to be at his ease only when he could with meticulous accuracy offer some precise piece of information. But if that was the case, he did not realize that to postulate that the accuracy of these details was important was to profess an opinion. I thought again of that dinner at which I was so sad because Mama would not be coming up to my room and at which he had said that the balls given by the Princesse de Leon were of no importance whatsoever. But it was to just that sort of pleasure that he devoted his life. I found all this contradictory. For what other lifetime was he reserving the moment when he would at last say seriously what he thought of things, formulate opinions that he did not have to put between quotation marks, and no longer indulge with punctilious politeness in occupations which he declared at the same time to be ridiculous? I also noticed in the way Swann talked to me about Bergotte something that was, on the other hand, not peculiar to him, but shared at the time by all the writer's admirers, by my mother's friend, by Doctor du Boulbon. Like Swann, they said about Bergotte: 'He's quite enchanting, so individual, he has his own way of saying things which is a little overly elaborate, but so pleasing. You don't need to see the signature, you know right away that it's by him.' But none of them would have gone so far as to say: 'He's a great writer, he has a great talent.' They did not even say he had talent. They did not say it because they did not know it. We are very slow to recognize in the particular features of a new writer the model that is labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas. Precisely because these features are new, we do not think they fully resemble what we call talent. Instead, we talk about originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we realize that all of this is, in fact, talent. Are there any books by Bergotte in which he talks about La Berma? I asked M. Swann. I think so, in his slim little volume on Racine, but it must be out of print. There may have been a reissue, though. I'll find out. I can also ask Bergotte anything you like; there isn't a week in the whole year when he doesn't come to dinner at our house. He's my daughter's greatest friend. They go off together visiting old towns, cathedrals, castles. Since I had no notion of social hierarchy, for a long time the fact that my father found it impossible for us to associate with Mme and Mlle Swann had had the effect above all, by making me imagine a great distance between them and us, of giving them prestige in my eyes. I was sorry my mother did not dye her hair and put lipstick on her lips as I had heard our neighbour Mme Sazerat say that Mme Swann did in order to please, not her husband, but M. de Charlus, and I thought we must be an object of scorn to her, which distressed me most of all because of Mlle Swann, who, from what I had been told, was such a pretty little girl and about whom I often dreamed, giving her each time the same arbitrary and charming face. But when I learned that day that Mlle Swann was a creature of so rare a condition, bathing as though in her natural element in the midst of such privileges, that when she asked her parents if anyone was coming to dinner, she would be answered by those syllables filled with light, by the name of that golden dinner guest who was for her only an old friend of the family: Bergotte; that for her the intimate talk at the table, the equivalent for me of my great-aunt's conversation, would be Bergotte's words on all the subjects he had not been able to broach in his books, and on which I would have liked to hear him pronounce his oracles; and that, lastly, when she went to visit other towns, he would walk along next to her, unknown and glorious, like the Gods who descended among mortals; then I was conscious both of the worth of a creature like Mlle Swann and also of how crude and ignorant I would appear to her, and I felt so keenly the sweetness and the impossibility of my being her friend that I was filled at once with desire and despair. Most often, now, when I thought of her, I would see her in front of a cathedral porch, explaining to me what the statues meant and, with a smile that said good things about me, introducing me as her friend to Bergotte. And always the charm of all those ideas awakened in me by the cathedrals, the charm of the hills of Ile-de-France and the plains of Normandy, cast reflections which overflowed on to the picture I was forming of Mlle Swann: this was what it meant to be quite ready to fall in love with her. Our belief that a person participates in an unknown life which his or her love would allow us to enter is, of all that love demands in order to come into being, what it prizes the most, and what makes it care little for the rest. Even women who claim to judge a man by his appearance alone see that appearance as the emanation of a special life. This is why they love soldiers, firemen; the uniform makes them less particular about the face; they think that under the breast-plate they are kissing a different heart, adventurous and sweet; and a young sovereign, a crown prince, may make the most flattering conquests in the foreign countries he visits without needing the regular profile that would perhaps be indispensable to a stockbroker. While I read in the garden, something my great-aunt would not have understood my doing except on a Sunday, a day when it is forbidden to occupy oneself with anything serious and when she did not sew (on a weekday, she would have said to me 'What? Still amusing yourself with a book? This isn't Sunday, you know,' giving the word amusement the meaning of childishness and waste of time), my Aunt Leonie would gossip with Francoise, waiting until it was time for Eulalie. She would announce that she had just seen Mme Goupil go by 'without an umbrella, in that silk dress she had made for her at Chateaudun. If she has far to go before Vespers, she could very well get it properly drenched.' 'Maybe, maybe' (meaning maybe",2.7378535826864248,1.066218824049275,0.41983781015554394,0.07234765345126845,4.16398891966759,4.0,2.3082964038367924,25.422535211267604,17.0,30.358729385643468,1.2592797783933518,1.0,0.608643677951394,1805,611,0.33850415512465376,7842,71,65.79471183034161,3.7521508160380905e+28,1.8030518097251756e+25,0.7120469676596778,0.6987429706082828,74.49605750848582,9.184290117435918,9.80641137383143,12.318598572041669,10.89365541726815,7.519933518005537,41.15660723342827,4.0,True,1175.0,0.8808265257087938,3.7683805862566073,2081.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074673304293715,0.0028002489110143126,0.0,0.011052378664103796,22,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"come for lunch an hour-and-a-half late covered with mud, instead of apologizing, he had said: I never allow myself to be influenced either by atmospheric perturbations or by the conventional divisions of time. I would happily instate the use of the opium pipe and the Malay kris,21 but I know nothing about the use of these infinitely more pernicious and also insipidly bourgeois implements, the watch and the umbrella. He would have returned to Combray despite all this. He was not, of course, the friend my parents would have wanted for me; in the end they had believed that the tears he shed over my grandmother's indisposition were not feigned; but they knew, either instinctively or from experience, that our impulsive emotions have little influence over the course of our actions or the conduct of our lives, and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to friends, the completion of a piece of work, obedience to a rule of life, have a surer foundation in blind habits than in those momentary transports, ardent and sterile. They would have preferred for me, instead of Bloch, companions who would have given me no more than is suitable to give one's friends, according to the laws of bourgeois morality; who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruits because they had been thinking of me with affection that day, but who, being incapable of tipping in my favour the correct balance of the obligations and claims of friendship by a simple impulse of their imagination and sensibility, would also not tamper with it to my detriment. Even our offences will not easily divert from their duty towards us those natures of which the model was my great-aunt, who, estranged for years from a niece to whom she never spoke, did not for this reason change the will in which she left that niece her entire fortune, because she was her closest relative and it 'was proper'. But I liked Bloch, my parents wanted to make me happy, the insoluble problems I posed for myself concerning the meaningless beauty of the daughter of Minos and Pasiphae tired me more and made me more ill than further conversations with him would have done, even though my mother felt they were harmful. And he would still have been received at Combray, if, after that dinner, having just informed me news that later had a great deal of influence on my life and made it first happier, then less happy that every woman thought only about love and that there was not one whose resistance could not be overcome, he had not assured me that he had heard most positively that my great-aunt had had a tempestuous youth and had been known as a kept woman. I could not stop myself from repeating these remarks to my parents, he was shown the door when he returned, and when I went up to him afterwards in the street, he was extremely cold to me. But on the subject of Bergotte what he had said was true. In the first few days, like a melody one will become infatuated with but that one cannot yet make out, what I was to love so much in his style was not apparent to me. I could not put down the novel I was reading by him, but thought I was interested only in the subject, as in that first period of love when you go to meet a woman every day at some gathering, some entertainment, thinking you are drawn to it by its pleasures. Then I noticed the rare, almost archaic expressions he liked to use at certain moments, when a hidden wave of harmony, an inner prelude, would heighten his style; and it was also at these moments that he would speak of the 'vain dream of life', the 'inexhaustible torrent of beautiful appearances', the 'sterile and delicious torment of understanding and loving', the 'moving effigies that for ever ennoble the venerable and charming facades of our cathedrals', that he expressed an entire philosphy, new to me, through marvellous images which seemed themselves to have awakened this harp-song which then arose and to whose accompaniment they gave a sublime quality. One of these passages by Bergotte, the third or fourth that I had isolated from the rest, filled me with a joy that could not be compared to the joy I had discovered in the first one, a joy I felt I was experiencing in a deeper, vaster, more unified region of myself, from which all obstacles and partitions seemed to have been removed. What had happened was that, recognizing the same preference for rare expressions, the same musical effusion, the same idealist philosophy that had already, the other times, without my realizing it, been the source of my pleasure, I no longer had the impression I was in the presence of a particular passage from a certain book by Bergotte, tracing on the surface of my mind a purely linear figure, but rather of the 'ideal passage' by Bergotte, common to all his books, to which all the analogous passages that merged with it had added a sort of thickness, a sort of volume, by which my mind seemed enlarged. I was not quite Bergotte's only admirer; he was also the favourite writer of a friend of my mother's, a very well-read woman, while Doctor du Boulbon would keep his patients waiting as he read Bergotte's most recent book; and it was from his consulting room, and from a park near Combray, that some of the first seeds of that predilection for Bergotte took flight, a rare species then, now universally widespread, so that all through Europe, all through America, even in the smallest village, one can find its ideal and common flower. What my mother's friend and, it seems, Doctor du Boulbon liked above all in Bergotte's books, as I did, was that same melodic flow, those old-fashioned expressions, a few others which were very simple and familiar, but which enjoyed, to judge from the places in which he focused attention on them, a particular preference on his part; lastly, in the sad passages, a certain brusqueness, a tone that was almost harsh. And no doubt he himself must have felt that these were his greatest charms. For in the books that followed, if he had found out some great truth, or the name of a famous cathedral, he would interrupt his narrative and, in an invocation, an apostrophe, a long prayer, he would give vent to those exhalations which in his early works remained interior to his prose, revealed only by the undulations of its surface, even sweeter, perhaps, more harmonious, when they were thus veiled and one could not have pointed out precisely where their murmur rose, where it died. These passages in which he took such pleasure were our favourite passages. I myself knew them by heart. I was disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Each time he talked about something whose beauty had until then been hidden from me, about pine forests, about hail, about Notre-Dame Cathedral, about Athalie or Phedre,22 with one image he would make that beauty explode into me. And so, realizing how many parts of the universe there were that my feeble perception would not be able to distinguish if he did not bring them close to me, I wanted to possess an opinion of his, a metaphor of his, for everything in the world, especially those things that I would have an opportunity of seeing myself, and, of the latter, particularly for some of the historic buildings of France and certain seascapes, because the insistence with which he mentioned them in his books proved that he considered them rich in meaning and beauty. Unfortunately, about almost everything in the world I did not know what his opinion was. I did not doubt that it was entirely different from my own, since it came down from an unknown world towards which I was trying to rise: persuaded that my thoughts would have looked like pure ineptitude to that perfect mind, I had made such a clean sweep of them all that, when by chance I happened to encounter in one of his books a thought that I had already had myself, my heart would swell as though a god in his goodness had given it back to me, had declared it legitimate and beautiful. It happened now and then that a page of his would say the same things that I often wrote to my grandmother and my mother at night when I could not sleep, so that this page by Bergotte seemed like a collection of epigraphs to be placed at the beginnings of my letters. Later still, when I began writing a book, and the quality of certain sentences was not high enough to convince me to continue it, I would find their equivalent in Bergotte. But it was only then, when I read them in his book, that I could enjoy them; when I was the one composing them, anxious that they should reflect exactly what I perceived in my thoughts, afraid I would not 'make a good likeness', I hardly had time to ask myself whether what I was writing was agreeable! But in fact there was no other sort of sentence, no other sort of idea, that I really loved. My uneasy and dissatisfied efforts were themselves a sign of love, a love without pleasure but profound. And so, when I suddenly found sentences like these in a book by another person, that is, without having to suffer my usual qualms, my usual severity, without having to torment myself, I would at last abandon myself with delight to my partiality for them, like a cook who, when for once he does not have to cook, at last finds the time to be a glutton. One day, when I encountered in a book by Bergotte a joke about an old servant woman which the writer's magnificent and solemn language made even more ironical, but which was the same joke I had often made to my grandmother when talking about Francoise, another time when I saw that he did not think it unworthy to portray in one of those mirrors of truth which were his books a remark similar to one I had had occasion to make about our friend M. Legrandin (remarks about Francoise and M. Legrandin that were certainly among those I would most resolutely have sacrificed to Bergotte, persuaded that he would find them uninteresting), it seemed to me suddenly that my humble life and the realms of the truth were not as widely separated as I had thought, that they even coincided at certain points, and from confidence and joy",3.8840691914464958,1.183128673019863,0.43058445329709977,0.05095493191983494,4.4378796245168415,4.0,2.469220961718544,53.26470588235294,52.0,36.316669988190576,1.3136388735505247,1.0,0.6645779020287105,1811,645,0.35615681943677524,8271,34,63.60073507037004,4.182618808326758e+27,2.053322929959135e+24,0.8741395925030564,0.8685068525373936,41.637474827037394,20.684174002013837,14.038888211671637,24.04470068535421,26.104765972650796,9.739017117614576,72.97757170234189,10.5,True,1158.0,0.8929798723613157,4.060382916053019,2037.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005461225300367392,0.0031774401747592094,0.002383080131069407,0.011291114383897889,21,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"not), said Francoise so as not to rule out absolutely the possibility of a more favourable alternative. 'Oh dear, said my aunt, striking her forehead, that reminds me I never found out if she arrived at church after the elevation. I will have to remember to ask Eulalie... Francoise, just look at that black cloud behind the steeple, and that pitiful sunlight on the slates. It's sure to rain before the day is done. It couldn't possibly stay like this, it was too hot. And the sooner the better, because until the storm breaks, my Vichy water won't go down,' added my aunt, in whose mind her desire to hasten the descent of her Vichy water was infinitely more important than her fear of seeing Mme Goupil ruin her dress. Maybe, maybe. And the fact is, when it rains on the square there isn't much shelter. What, three o'clock? my aunt cried out suddenly, turning pale, why, my goodness, Vespers has begun and I've forgotten my pepsin! Now I know why my Vichy water was lying on my stomach. And swooping down on a missal bound in violet velvet, with gilt clasps, from which, in her haste, she let escape a few of those pictures edged with a band of yellowing paper lace that mark the pages of the feast days, my aunt, while swallowing her drops, began reading the sacred texts as fast as she could, her comprehension of them slightly obscured by her uncertainty as to whether the pepsin, taken so long after the Vichy water, would still be able to catch up with it and make it go down. 'Three o'clock! It's unbelievable how the time passes!' A little tap against the window-pane, as though something had struck it, followed by a copious light spill, as of grains of sand dropping from a window above, then the spill extending, growing regular, finding a rhythm, turning fluid, resonant, musical, immeasurable, universal: it was the rain. Well, now, Francoise! What did I tell you? How it's coming down! But I think I heard the bell at the garden gate: go and see who could be outside in such weather. Francoise returned: It was Mme Amedee (my grandmother) she said she was going for a little walk. And yet it's raining hard. That doesn't surprise me at all, said my aunt, lifting her eyes to the skies. I've always said that her way of thinking is different from everyone else's. I'd rather it be her than me outdoors just now. Mme Amedee is always as different as she can be from everyone else,' said Francoise gently, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from saying that she believed my grandmother was a little 'touched'. 'Now, see? The Benediction is over! Eulalie won't be coming, sighed my aunt; the weather must have frightened her away. But it's not five o'clock, Madame Octave, it's only half-past four. Only half-past four? And I had to raise the little curtains to get a wretched glimmer of daylight. At half-past four! One week before the Rogations! Oh, my poor Francoise, the Good Lord must be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far these days! As my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten the Good Lord too often and he's taking his revenge. A bright flush enlivened my aunt's cheeks; it was Eulalie. Unfortunately, scarcely had she been shown in before Francoise returned and, with a smile that was meant to indicate her participation in the joy she was sure her words would give my aunt, articulating the syllables to show that, despite her use of the indirect style, she was reporting, good servant that she was, the very words the visitor had condescended to use: M. le Cure would be delighted, enchanted, if Mme Octave is not resting and could see him. M. le Cure does not wish to disturb. M. le Cure is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour. In fact, the cure's visits did not give my aunt as much pleasure as Francoise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which Francoise thought she must illuminate her face each time she had to announce him did not entirely correspond to the invalid's feelings. The cure (an excellent man with whom I am sorry I did not have more conversations, for if he understood nothing about the arts, he did know many etymologies), being in the habit of enlightening distinguished visitors with information about the church (he even intended to write a book about the parish of Combray), fatigued her with endless explanations that were in fact always the same. But when his visit came at the very same time as Eulalie's, it became frankly unpleasant for my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie and not have all her company at once. But she did not dare decline to see the cure and only made a sign to Eulalie not to leave at the same time, so that she could keep her there by herself for a little while after he was gone. Monsieur le Cure, what's this they've been telling me, that a painter has set up his easel in your church and is copying a window? I must say, old as I am, I've never in my life heard of such a thing! What is the world coming to? And the ugliest part of the church, too! I will not go so far as to say it is the ugliest, for if there are parts of Saint-Hilaire that are well worth a visit, others are very old in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored! My Lord, the porch is dirty and ancient, but really majestic in character; the case is the same for the tapestries of Esther, for which personally I would not give two sous, but which the experts rank immediately after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain rather realistic details, they offer some others that show a genuine power of observation. But don't talk to me about the windows! Is there any sense in leaving us with windows that give no light and even deceive our eyes with patches of colour I would never be able to define, in a church where no two flag-stones are on the same level and they refuse to replace them for me with the excuse that these are the tombstones of the Abbes de Combray and the Seigneurs de Guer-mantes, the old Comtes de Brabant? The direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes and of the Duchesse too since she's a Demoiselle de Guermantes who married her cousin. ' (My grandmother, who, because she took no notice of other people, ended by confusing all names, would claim, each time anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes, that she must be a relative of Mme de Villeparisis. Everyone would burst out laughing; she would try to defend herself by harking back to some official announcement: 'I seem to recall there was something in it about Guermantes.' And for once I would side with the others against her, unable to admit that there was any connection between her friend from boarding school and the descendant of Genevieve de Brabant.) 'Look at Roussainville, today it is no more than a parish of farmers, though in ancient times the locality experienced a great boom in the commerce of felt hats and clocks. (I'm not sure of the etymology of Roussainville. I'm inclined to think the original name was Rouville (Radulfi villa), analogous to Chateauroux (Castrum Radulfi), but we can talk about that some other time.) Well! The church has superb windows, almost all modern, including that impressive Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray, which would be more in keeping at Combray itself and which is just as good, they say, as the famous windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I saw Doctor Percepied's brother, who goes in for these things and who regards it as a very fine piece of work. But, as I in fact said to this artist, who seems very polite, by the way, and who is apparently a veritable virtuoso with the paintbrush, I said, now what do you find so extraordinary about this window, which is if anything a little darker than the others?' I'm sure that if you asked the Bishop, my aunt said feebly, beginning to think she was going to be tired, he would not refuse you a new window. You may depend upon it, Madame Octave, answered the cure. But it was His Grace himself who started all the fuss about this wretched window by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, Sire de Guermantes, a direct descendant of Genevieve de Brabant, who was a Demoiselle de Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire. But I can't see where Saint-Hilaire would be. Why, in the corner of the window you never noticed a lady in a yellow dress? Well, now, that's Saint Hilaire, who in certain provinces is also called, you know, Saint Illiers, Saint Helier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. And these various corruptions of sanctus Hilarius are not the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed. For instance, your own patron, my good Eulalie, sancta Eulalia do you know what she is in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, quite simply: she has become a male saint. You see, Eulalie? after you die they will turn you into a man. Monsieur le Cure always has a joke for us. Gilbert's brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince but, having early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has had no discipline in his youth, and, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he didn't like, would massacre every last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to take revenge on Charles, caused the church of Combray to be burned down, the original church at the time, which Theodebert, when he and his court left the country house he had near here, at Thiberzy (which would be Theodeberciacus), to go to fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Blessed One would grant him the victory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt which Theodore must have taken you down into, for Gilbert burned the rest. Finally, he defeated the unfortunate Charles with the help of William the Conqueror' (the cure pronounced it Will'am), 'which is why so many English people come to see it. But he apparently was unable to win the affection of",2.7006949303162573,1.098460729511682,0.4090231512113661,0.09644812923184679,4.311357340720222,4.0,2.336867848899834,21.235294117647058,15.0,19.62690054271165,1.2897506925207756,1.0,0.6207226544488752,1805,675,0.3739612188365651,8180,85,67.31566515934816,1.717204130132949e+29,8.054428377734283e+25,0.6404378097504377,0.623048277476421,76.16826788333063,7.910822877627506,9.3871,10.754505458693174,9.494140133615776,8.156875346260389,38.79762098745315,3.7294117647058824,True,1110.0,0.8639774859287055,3.8367729831144466,2132.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009819639278557115,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007715430861723447,0.004008016032064128,0.004208416833667334,0.009380863039399626,23,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"the people of Combray, for they rushed upon him as he was coming out of Mass and cut off his head. Theodore has a little book he lends out to people that explains it all. 'But what is unquestionably the most extraordinary thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is magnificent. Certainly in your case, since you're not strong, I would never advise you to climb our ninety-seven steps, exactly half the number of the celebrated dome in Milan. It's quite tiring enough for someone in good health, especially as you must go up bent double if you don't want to crack your head, and you collect all the cobwebs off the stairwell on your clothes. In any case you would have to wrap yourself up quite snugly,' he added (without noticing my aunt's indignation at the idea that she was capable of climbing into the belfry), 'because there's quite a breeze once you get to the top! Some people declare they have felt the chill of death up there. Nonetheless, on Sundays there are always groups coming even from a long way off to admire the beauty of the panorama, and they go away enchanted. Now next Sunday, if the weather holds, you'll be sure to find some people there, since it's Rogation Day. It really must be admitted, though, that from that spot the scene is magical, with what you might call vistas over the plain that have quite a special charm of their own. On a clear day, you can see all the way to Verneuil. But the great thing is that you can see all in one glance things you can't usually see except one without the other, like the course of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-les-Combray, which are separated by a screen of tall trees, or the different canals at Jouy-le Vicomte (Gaudiacus vice comitis, as you know). Each time I've gone to Jouy-le-Vicomte, of course, I've seen a bit of the canal, and then I've turned a corner and seen another bit, but by then I could no longer see the preceding bit. I could put them together in my mind, but that didn't have much of an effect for me. But from the Saint-Hilaire belfry it's different, the whole area seems to have been caught in a great web. Only you can't see any water; it's as though there were great clefts slicing up the town into different neighbourhoods so neatly it looks like a brioche which still holds together after it has been cut up. To do it right, you'd have to be in both places at the same time, in the steeple of Saint Hilaire and at Jouy-le-Vicomte.' The cure had so exhausted my aunt that he was scarcely gone before she had to send Eulalie away too. Here, my poor Eulalie, she said weakly, drawing a coin from a little purse that she had within reach of her hand, this is so that you won't forget me in your prayers. Oh, Madame Octave! I don't know if I should; you know I don't come here for that! Eulalie would say with the same hesitation and the same awkwardness, each time, as if it were the first, and with an appearance of dissatisfaction that cheered my aunt but did not displease her, because if one day Eulalie looked a little less vexed than usual as she took the coin, my aunt would say: I don't know what was bothering Eulalie; I gave her the same as usual, but yet she didn't look happy. I think she has nothing to complain about, all the same, Francoise would sigh, inclined to consider as small change anything my aunt gave her for herself or her children and as treasure madly squandered on an ingrate the little coins placed in Eulalie's hand each Sunday, but so discreetly that Francoise never managed to see them. It was not that Francoise would have wanted for herself the money my aunt gave Eulalie. She took sufficient pleasure in what my aunt possessed, knowing that the mistress's wealth both elevated and embellished her servant in everyone's eyes; and that she, Francoise, was distinguished and renowned in Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte and other places, on account of my aunt's many farms, the cure's frequent and extended visits, the singular number of bottles of Vichy water consumed. She was greedy only for my aunt; if it had been up to her to manage my aunt's fortune, which would have been her dream, she would have preserved it from the encroachments of others with a maternal ferocity. She would not, however, have seen any great harm in what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give away, as long as it went to rich people. Perhaps she thought that they, having no need of gifts from my aunt, could not be suspected of liking her because of them. Besides, gifts made to people of eminence and wealth, like Mme Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin, Mme Goupil, to persons 'of the same rank' as my aunt who 'were well matched', appeared to her to belong to the customs of the strange and brilliant life of the rich who hunt, give balls, visit back and forth, people whom she admired and smiled upon. But it was not the same if the beneficiaries of my aunt's generosity were what Francoise called 'people like me, people who are no better than me', the ones of whom she was most scornful unless they called her 'Madame Francoise' and considered themselves to be 'less than her'. And when she saw that despite her advice my aunt did just as she pleased and threw her money away as Francoise saw it, at least on the unworthy, she began to think the gifts my aunt made to her were quite small compared to the imaginary sums lavished on Eulalie. There was not a single farm in the vicinity of Combray so substantial that Francoise did not suppose Eulalie could easily have bought it with all she earned from her visits. It is true that Eulalie formed the same estimate of the immense and hidden riches of Francoise. It was Francoise's habit, when Eulalie had gone, to make unkind predictions about her. She detested her, but she was also afraid of her and believed that when Eulalie was there she had to present a 'good face'. She made up for it after Eulalie's departure, without ever naming her, in fact, but proffering sibylline oracles, or pronouncements of a general character like those in Ecclesiastes, whose application could not escape my aunt. After watching through a corner of the curtain to see if Eulalie had closed the gate behind her, she would say: 'Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome and collect a little pocket money; but have patience, the Good Lord will punish them all one fine day,' with the sidelong glance and the insinuation of Joas thinking only of Athalie when he says: Le bonheur des mechants comme un torrent s'ecoule.26 But when the cure had come as well and his interminable visit had exhausted my aunt's strength, Francoise would leave the bedroom behind Eulalie and say: Madame Octave, I will let you rest, you look very tired. And my aunt would not even answer, breathing a sigh that must, it seemed, be the last, her eyes closed, as though dead. But scarcely had Francoise gone down, than four peals dealt with the greatest violence would echo through the house, and my aunt, upright on her bed, would cry out: Has Eulalie gone yet? Can you believe it I forgot to ask her if Mme Goupil arrived at Mass before the elevation! Quick, run after her! But Francoise would return without having been able to catch up with Eulalie. It's vexing, my aunt would say, shaking her head. The only important thing I had to ask her! In this way life went on for my Aunt Leonie, always the same, in the sweet uniformity of what she called, with affected disdain and deep tenderness, her 'little routine'. Preserved by everyone, not only in the house, where we had all experienced the futility of advising her to adopt a better health regimen and so had gradually resigned ourselves to respecting the routine, but even in the village where, three streets away from us, the goods packer, before nailing his crates, would send word to ask Francoise if my aunt was 'resting' this routine was, however, disturbed once during that year. Like a hidden fruit that had ripened without anyone's noticing and had dropped spontaneously, one night the kitchen-maid gave birth. But her pains were intolerable, and since there was no midwife in Combray, Francoise had to go off before daybreak to find one in Thiberzy. My aunt could not rest because of the kitchen-maid's cries, and since Francoise, despite the short distance, did not come back until very late, my aunt missed her very much. And so my mother said to me in the course of the morning: 'Go up, why don't you, and see if your aunt needs anything.' I went into the first room, and through the open door saw my aunt lying on her side sleeping; I heard her snoring lightly. I was going to go away quietly, but the noise I had made had probably interfered with her sleep and made it 'shift gears', as they say about cars, because the music of her snoring broke off for a second and resumed on a lower note, then she woke up and half turned her face, which I could now see; it expressed a sort of terror; she had obviously just had a horrible dream; she could not see me the way she was positioned, and I stayed there not knowing if I should go in to her or leave; but already she seemed to have returned to a sense of reality and had recognized the falsity of the visions that had frightened her; a smile of joy, of pious gratitude to God who permits life to be less cruel than dreams, weakly illuminated her face, and with the habit she had formed of talking to herself half-aloud when she thought she was alone, she murmured: 'God be praised! Our only worry is the kitchen-maid, who is having a baby. And here I've gone and dreamed that my poor Octave had come back to life and was trying to make me go for a walk every day!' Her hand went out towards her rosary, which was on the little table, but sleep was overcoming her again and did not leave her the strength to reach it: she fell asleep, soothed, and I crept out of the room without her or",3.5528673651936002,1.0801408190108632,0.4303692960374176,0.05285874901789503,4.254405286343612,4.0,2.1888364083519627,33.018181818181816,26.0,26.780923270859606,1.2312775330396475,1.0,0.5497613800166312,1816,634,0.3491189427312775,8086,55,63.31449242606682,3.141482792062188e+27,1.486037271552596e+24,0.799149242816148,0.8008613007248573,69.15546615939128,11.81616579895875,9.844476818778066,14.881281537845414,15.11733980776932,8.319427312775328,49.42787344813776,5.418181818181818,True,1146.0,0.8765373699148533,3.824976348155156,2114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008395711106615416,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016993728504956503,0.004551891563827635,0.002427675500708072,0.007095553453169348,24,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"anyone else ever finding out what I had heard. When I say that except for very rare events, like that confinement, my aunt's routine never suffered any variation, I am not speaking of those variations which, always the same and repeated at regular intervals, introduced into the heart of that uniformity only a sort of secondary uniformity. And so, for instance, every Saturday, because Francoise went to the Roussainville-le-Pin market in the afternoon, lunch was, for everyone, an hour earlier. And my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly violation of her habits that she clung to this habit as much as to the others. She was so well 'routined' to it, as Francoise said, that if she had had to wait, some Saturday, to have lunch at the regular hour, this would have 'disturbed' her as much as if on another day she had had to move her lunch forward to the Saturday hour. What was more, this early lunch gave Saturday, for all of us, a special face, indulgent and almost kindly. At a time when one usually has one more hour to live through before the relaxation of the meal, we knew that in a few seconds we would see the arrival of some precocious endives, a gratuitous omelette, an undeserved beefsteak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those little events, internal, local, almost civic, which, in peaceful lives and closed societies, create a sort of national bond and become the favourite theme of conversations, jokes, stories wantonly exaggerated: it would have been the ready-made nucleus for a cycle of legends, if one of us had had a propensity for the epic. First thing in the morning, before we were dressed, for no reason, for the pleasure of feeling the strength of our comradeship, we would say to one another with good humour, with warmth, with patriotism: 'There's no time to lose; don't forget it's Saturday!' while my aunt, conferring with Francoise and remembering that the day would be longer than usual, would say: 'You might make them a nice bit of veal, since it's Saturday.' If at ten-thirty one of us absentmindedly drew out his watch and said: 'Let's see, still an hour-and-a-half before lunch,' everyone was delighted to have to say to him: 'Come now, what are you thinking of, you're forgetting it's Saturday!'; we would still be laughing over it a quarter of an hour after and we would promise ourselves to go up and report this lapse to my aunt to amuse her. Even the face of the sky seemed changed. After lunch, the sun, aware that it was Saturday, would linger an hour longer at the top of the sky, and when someone, thinking we were late for our walk, said: 'What, only two o'clock?', watching, as they passed, the two strokes from the Saint-Hilaire steeple (which usually do not encounter anyone yet on paths deserted because of the midday meal or the afternoon nap, alongside the lively white stream which even the fisherman has abandoned, and go on alone into the empty sky where only a few lazy clouds remain), we would all answer him in chorus: 'But you're wrong, we had lunch an hour early; you know very well it's Saturday!' The surprise of a barbarian (this was what we called anyone who did not know what was special about Saturday) who, arriving at eleven o'clock to talk to my father, found us at the table, was one of the things in her life which most amused Francoise. But if she found it funny that the dumbfounded visitor did not know we had lunch earlier on Saturday, she found it even more comical (while at the same time sympathizing from the bottom of her heart with this narrow chauvinism) that my father himself had not realized that the barbarian might not know this and had responded with no further explanation to his astonishment at seeing us already in the dining-room: 'Well what do you expect, it's Saturday!' Having reached this point in her story, she would wipe away a few tears of hilarity and to increase her own pleasure, would prolong the dialogue, invent what had been said in answer by the visitor, to whom this 'Saturday' did not explain anything. And quite far from complaining about her embellishments, we would feel they were not enough for us and we would say: 'But I think he also said something else. It was longer the first time you told it.' Even my great-aunt would put down her needlework, lift her head and look over her glasses. What was also special about Saturday was that on this day, during the month of May, we would go out after dinner to attend the 'Month of Mary'. Since there we would sometimes meet M. Vinteuil, who was very severe about 'the deplorable fashion of slovenliness in young people, which seems to be encouraged these days', my mother would take care that nothing should be wrong with my appearance, then we would leave for church. It was in the Month of Mary that I remember beginning to be fond of hawthorns. Not only were they in the church, which was so holy but which we had the right to enter, they were put up on the altar itself, inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration they took part, their branches running out among the candles and holy vessels, attached horizontally to one another in a festive preparation and made even lovelier by the festoons of their foliage, on which were scattered in profusion, as on a bridal train, little bunches of buds of a dazzling whiteness. But, though I dared not do more than steal a glance at them, I felt that the ceremonious preparations were alive and that it was nature herself who, by carving those indentations in the leaves, by adding the supreme ornament of those white buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a popular festivity and a mystical celebration. Higher up, their corollas opened here and there with a careless grace, still holding so casually, like a last and vaporous adornment, the bouquets of stamens, delicate as gossamer, which clouded them entirely, that in following, in trying to mime deep inside myself the motion of their flowering, I imagined it as the quick and thoughtless movement of the head, with coquettish glance and contracted eyes, of a young girl in white, dreamy and alive. M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and sat down beside us. He was from a good family and had been my grandmother's sisters' piano teacher, and when, after his wife died and he came into an inheritance, he retired near Combray, we often entertained him at the house. But he was extremely prudish, and stopped coming so as not to meet Swann, who had made what he called 'an unsuitable marriage, as is the fashion these days'. My mother, after learning that he composed, had said to him in a friendly way that when she went to see him, he would have to let her hear something of his. M. Vinteuil would have taken great joy in this, but he was so scrupulous in his politeness and kindness that, always putting himself in the place of others, he was afraid he would bore them and appear egotistical if he pursued or even allowed them to infer his own desires. The day my parents had gone to visit him at his home, I had gone with them, but they had allowed me to stay outside and, since M. Vinteuil's house, Montjouvain, stood at the foot of a brush-covered hillock where I had hidden, I had found I was on a level with the second-floor drawing-room, a foot or two from the window. When the servant had come to announce my parents, I had seen M. Vinteuil hurry to place a piece of music in a conspicuous position on the piano. But once my parents had entered, he had taken it away and put it in a corner. No doubt he had been afraid of letting them think he was happy to see them only so that he could play them some of his compositions. And each time my mother had made a fresh attempt in the course of the visit, he had repeated several times: 'I don't know who put that on the piano, it doesn't belong there,' and had diverted the conversation to other subjects, precisely because they interested him less. His only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her boyish appearance, seemed so robust that one could not help smiling at the sight of the precautions her father took for her sake, always having extra shawls to throw over her shoulders. My grandmother pointed out what a gentle, delicate, almost shy expression often came into the eyes of that rough-mannered child, whose face was covered with freckles. After she made a remark, she would hear it with the minds of the people to whom she had made it, would grow alarmed at possible misunderstandings, and one would see, illuminated, showing through as though by transparency, under the mannish face of the 'good fellow' that she was, the more refined features of a young girl in tears. When, before leaving the church, I kneeled in front of the altar, I suddenly smelled, as I stood up, a bitter-sweet scent of almonds escaping from the hawthorns, and then I noticed, on the flowers, little yellower places under which I imagined that scent must be hidden, as the taste of a frangipani must be hidden under the burned parts, or that of Mlle Vinteuil's cheeks under their freckles. Despite the silence and stillness of the hawthorns, this intermittent scent was like the murmuring of an intense life with which the altar quivered like a country hedge visited by living antennae, of which I was reminded by the sight of certain stamens, almost russet-red, that seemed to have preserved the springtime virulence, the irritant power, of insects now metamorphosed into flowers. We would talk with M. Vinteuil for a moment in front of the porch on our way out of church. He would intervene among the children squabbling in the square, take up the defence of the little ones, deliver a lecture to the older ones. If his daughter said to us in her loud voice how happy she was to see us, it would immediately seem as if a more sensitive sister within her were blushing at this thoughtless, tomboyish remark, which might have made us think she was asking to be invited to our house. Her father would throw a cloak over her shoulders, they would get up into a little cabriolet, which she would",3.3881188360811207,0.9349363277628121,0.4461047301470467,0.05838427288194983,4.386225895316804,4.0,2.378305951651303,39.45652173913044,34.5,23.742922535155543,1.2991735537190083,1.0,0.648179803783932,1815,656,0.36143250688705236,8289,46,65.35575779826833,2.4190507095620233e+28,1.1464695305981152e+25,0.841122340493732,0.8253291486339136,56.876547790154504,15.12829141214517,12.239951139068232,18.36112109234639,18.957384836507366,9.24081542699724,57.748532758414186,7.217391304347826,True,1151.0,0.8687203791469195,3.928436018957346,2110.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00951531370799881,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008325899494498959,0.006442660323124194,0.005550599662999306,0.005687203791469194,25,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"request, she would observe my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the look on her face what she thought and what she would decide. And so while some artist who, reading the memoirs of the seventeenth century and wanting to be like the great King, thinks he will be making progress in that direction if he fabricates a genealogy for himself that traces his own descent from a historic family or if he carries on a correspondence with one of the current sovereigns of Europe is actually turning his back on what he mistakenly sought in forms that were identical and consequently dead an old lady from the provinces who was simply yielding to irresistible manias and to a malice born of idleness, saw, without ever thinking of Louis XIV, the most insignificant occupations of her day, those concerned with her rising, her lunch, her afternoon rest, acquire, because of their despotic singularity, some of the interest of what Saint-Simon called the 'mechanics' of life at Versailles,30 and could also believe that her silences, a nuance of good humour or disdain in her features, were for Francoise the object of a commentary as passionate, as fearful as were the silence, the good humour, the disdain of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest lords, handed him a petition at the bend of an avenue at Versailles. One Sunday when my aunt had had a visit from the cure and Eulalie at the same time and had afterwards rested, we all went up to say good evening to her, and Mama offered her her condolences on the bad luck that always brought her visitors at the same hour: I know that things turned out badly again this afternoon, Leonie,' she said to her gently, 'you had all your company here at the same time. Which my great-aunt interrupted with: 'Too much of a good thing can do no harm...' because, ever since her daughter had become ill, she had believed it was her duty to cheer her up by consistently showing her the bright side of everything. But now my father spoke: I would like to take advantage, he said, of the fact that the whole family is together to tell you all about something without having to begin all over again with each of you separately. I'm afraid we've had a falling-out with Legrandin: he barely said hello to me this morning. I did not stay to hear my father's story, because I had actually been with him after Mass when we met M. Legrandin, and I went down to the kitchen to ask about the menu for our dinner, which diverted me every day like the news in the paper and excited me like the programme for some festivity. When M. Legrandin had passed near us as he was coming out of the church, walking by the side of a lady from a neighbouring chateau whom we knew only by sight, my father had greeted him in a way that was at once friendly and reserved, though we had not stopped; M. Legrandin had barely responded, with a surprised look, as if he did not recognize us, and with that perspective in his gaze peculiar to people who do not want to be friendly and who, from the suddenly extended depths of their eyes, seem to perceive you at the end of an interminable road and at so great a distance that they confine themselves to addressing to you a minuscule nod in order to give it the proportions of your puppet-like dimensions. Now the lady whom Legrandin was accompanying was a virtuous and esteemed person; it was quite out of the question that he was having an affair and embarrassed at being found out, and my father wondered how he might have annoyed Legrandin. 'I would be especially sorry to know he is vexed,' said my father, 'because of the fact that among all those people dressed up in their Sunday best there is something about him, with his little straight jacket, his loose tie, that is so uncontrived, so truly simple, an air of ingenuousness, almost, that is extremely likeable.' But the family council was unanimously of the opinion that my father was imagining things, or that Legrandin, at that particular moment, was absorbed in some other thought. And in fact my father's apprehension was dispelled the very next evening. As we were returning from a long walk, near the Pont-Vieux we saw Legrandin, who because of the holidays was staying in Combray for a few days. He came up to us with his hand outstretched: 'My young bookworm, he asked me, do you know this line by Paul Desjardins: Les bois sont deja noirs, le ciel est encor bleu.31 Isn't that a fine rendering of this hour of the day? Perhaps you've never read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my child; today he is transforming himself, they tell me, into a sermonizing friar, but for a long time he was a limpid water-colourist... Les bois sont deja noirs, le ciel est encor bleu... May the sky remain for ever blue for you, my young friend; and even at the hour which is now approaching for me, when the woods are dark already, when night is falling fast, you will console yourself as I do by looking up towards the sky. ' He took a cigarette out of his pocket, remained for a long time with his eyes on the horizon. 'Good-bye, friends,' he said to us suddenly, and he left us. At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what the menu was, dinner would already have been started, and Francoise, commanding the forces of nature, which were now her assistants, as in fairy plays where giants hire themselves out as cooks, would strike the coal, entrust the steam with some potatoes to cook and make the fire finish to perfection the culinary masterpieces first prepared in potters' vessels that ranged from great vats, casseroles, cauldrons and fishkettles to terrines for game, moulds for pastry and little jugs for cream, and included a complete collection of pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had just shelled them, to see the peas lined up and tallied like green marbles in a game; but what delighted me were the asparagus, steeped in ultramarine and pink, whose tips, delicately painted with little strokes of mauve and azure, shade off imperceptibly down to their feet still soiled though they are from the dirt of their garden-bed with an iridescence that is not of this earth. It seemed to me that these celestial hues revealed the delicious creatures who had merrily metamorphosed themselves into vegetables and who, through the disguise of their firm, edible flesh, disclosed in these early tints of dawn, in these beginnings of rainbows, in this extinction of blue evenings, the precious essence that I recognized again when, all night long following a dinner at which I had eaten them, they played, in farces as crude and poetic as a fairy play by Shakespeare, at changing my chamber pot into a jar of perfume. Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann called her, instructed by Francoise to 'scrape' them, would have them beside her in a basket, her expression as mournful as though she were suffering all the misfortunes of the earth; and the light crowns of azure that girded the asparagus stalks above their tunics of pink were delicately drawn, star by star, as, in the fresco, are the flowers bound around the forehead or tucked into the basket of Virtue at Padua. And meanwhile, Francoise would be turning on the spit, as she alone knew how to roast them, one of those chickens which had carried the fragrance of her merits through the far reaches of Combray and which, while she was serving them to us at the table, would make the quality of gentleness predominate in my particular conception of her character, the aroma of that flesh which she knew how to render so unctuous and so tender being for me only the specific perfume of one of her virtues. But the day when, as my father consulted the family council about the encounter with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen was one of those on which Giotto's Charity, very ill from her recent confinement, could not get out of bed; Francoise, having no help now, was late. When I arrived downstairs she was busy, in the scullery that opened on to the poultry-yard, killing a chicken which, by its desperate and quite natural resistance, but accompanied by Francoise, beside herself as she tried to split its neck under the ear, with cries of 'Filthy creature! Filthy creature!', put the saintly gentleness and unction of our servant a little less in evidence than it would, at dinner the next day, by its skin embroidered with gold like a chasuble and its precious juice drained from a ciborium. When it was dead, Francoise collected the blood, which flowed without drowning her resentment, had another fit of anger, and looking at her enemy's cadaver, said one last time: 'Filthy creature!' I went back upstairs trembling all over; I wanted them to dismiss Francoise immediately. But who would have prepared me such cosy hot-water bottles, such fragrant coffee, and even... those chickens? And in fact, everyone had had to make this cowardly calculation, just as I had. For my Aunt Leonie knew as I did not yet know that Francoise, who would for her daughter, for her nephews, have given her life without a murmur, was singularly hard-hearted towards other people. Despite this my aunt had kept her, for if she was aware of her cruelty, she valued her service. I gradually came to see that the gentleness, the compunction, the virtues of Francoise concealed scullery tragedies, just as history reveals that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed with their hands joined in church windows were marked by bloody incidents. I realized that, apart from her own relatives, human beings inspired her with more pity for their afflictions the farther away from her they lived. The torrents of tears she shed while reading in the newspaper about the misfortunes of strangers would dry up quickly if she could picture to herself at all precisely the person concerned. On one of the nights following the confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized by appalling cramps: Mama heard her moaning, got up and woke Francoise, who, quite indifferent, declared that all this wailing was a sham, that the girl wanted 'to be the centre of attention'. The doctor, who had been afraid of such attacks, had put a marker in a medical book we had, at the page",3.702600150387144,0.9954153321866321,0.4156738227248554,0.06950671191537171,4.465526751241037,4.0,2.4460077474715565,45.325,33.5,38.19253035607879,1.3055708769994485,1.0,0.641768161364484,1813,724,0.39933811362382793,8374,40,62.304047976127634,1.1436792357241205e+27,5.5223526592183515e+23,0.7885732627831973,0.7982166164407605,50.378828805846666,17.49248634859349,13.308373905834344,20.931985659128518,22.265130998345285,9.804236072807498,65.45737727523442,9.125,True,1068.0,0.8797682279092226,4.043457267020763,2071.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013563986632592884,0.013563986632592884,0.008452919205818754,0.008452919205818754,0.008452919205818754,0.008452919205818754,0.008256339689404365,0.0032435620208374288,0.0,0.008691453404152583,27,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"drive herself, and the two of them would return to Montjouvain. As for us, since it was Sunday the next day and we would not get up until time for High Mass, if there was moonlight and the air was warm, instead of having us go home directly, my father, out of a love of personal glory, would take us by way of the Calvary on a long walk which my mother's incapacity for orienting herself, or knowing what road she was on, made her consider the feat of a strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, whose spans of stone like great strides began at the railway station and represented to me the exile and distress that lay outside the civilized world, because each year as we came from Paris we were warned to pay careful attention, when Combray came, not to let the station go by, to be ready ahead of time because the train would leave again after two minutes and would set off across the viaduct beyond the Christian countries of which Combray marked for me the farthest limit. We would return by way of the station boulevard, which was lined by the most pleasant houses in the parish. In each garden the moonlight, like Hubert Robert,27 scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains, its half-open gates. Its light had destroyed the Telegraph Office. All that remained of it was one column, half-shattered but still retaining the beauty of an immortal ruin. I was dragging my feet, I was ready to drop with sleep, the fragrance of the lindens that perfumed the air seemed to me a reward that one could win only at the cost of the greatest fatigue and that was not worth the trouble. From gates far apart, dogs awakened by our solitary steps sent forth alternating barks such as I still hear at times in the evening and among which the station boulevard (when the public garden of Combray was created on its site) must have come to take refuge, for, wherever I find myself, as soon as they begin resounding and replying, I see it, with its lindens and its pavement lit by the moon. Suddenly my father would stop us and ask my mother: 'Where are we?' Exhausted from walking but proud of him, she would admit tenderly that she had absolutely no idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. Then, as if he had taken it out of his jacket pocket along with his key, he would show us the little back gate of our own garden, which stood there before us, having come, along with the corner of the rue du Saint-Esprit, to wait for us at the end of these unfamiliar streets. My mother would say to him with admiration: 'You are astonishing!' And from that moment on, I did not have to take another step, the ground walked for me through that garden where for so long now my actions had ceased to be accompanied by any deliberate attention: Habit had taken me in its arms, and it carried me all the way to my bed like a little child. If Saturday, which began an hour earlier and deprived her of Francoise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt, she nonetheless awaited its return with impatience from the beginning of the week, because it contained all the novelty and distraction that her weakened and finical body was still able to endure. And yet this was not to say that she did not now and then aspire to some greater change, that she did not experience those exceptional moments when we thirst for something other than what we have, and when people who from a lack of energy or imagination cannot find a source of renewal in themselves ask the next minute that comes, the postman as he rings, to bring them something new, even if it is something worse, some emotion, some sorrow; when our sensibility, which happiness has silenced like an idle harp, wants to resonate under some hand, even a brutal one, and even if it might be broken by it; when the will, which has with such difficulty won the right to surrender unimpeded to its desires, to its afflictions, would like to throw the reins into the hands of imperious events, even if they may be cruel. No doubt, since my aunt's strength, drained by the least fatigue, returned to her only drop by drop deep within her repose, the reservoir was very slow to fill up, and months would go by before she had that slight overflow which others divert into activity and which she was incapable of knowing, and deciding, how to use. I have no doubt that then just as the desire to replace it by potatoes with bechamel sauce ended after a certain time by being born from the very pleasure she felt at the daily return of the mashed potatoes of which she did not 'get tired' she would derive from the accumulation of those monotonous days which she valued so the expectation of some domestic cataclysm lasting only a moment but forcing her to bring about once and for all one of those changes which she recognized would be beneficial to her and to which she could not of her own accord make up her mind. She truly loved us, she would have taken pleasure in mourning for us; occurring at a moment when she felt well and was not in a sweat, the news that the house was being consumed by a fire in which all of us had perished already and which would soon not leave a single stone of the walls standing, but from which she would have ample time to escape without hurrying, so long as she got out of bed right away, must often have lingered among her hopes, since it combined, with the secondary advantages of allowing her to savour all her tenderness for us in an extended grief and to be the cause of stupefaction in the village as she led the funeral procession, courageous and stricken, dying on her feet, that other much more precious advantage of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to lose, no possibility of an enervating hesitation, to go and spend the summer on her pretty farm, Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. As no event of that sort had ever occurred, the outcome of which she would certainly contemplate when she was alone, absorbed in her innumerable games of patience (and which would have reduced her to despair from the first moment of its realization, from the first of those little unforeseen developments, the first word announcing the bad news, whose accent can never be forgotten afterwards, everything that bears the imprint of real death, so different from its logical, abstract possibility), she would from time to time resort to introducing into her life, to make it more interesting, imaginary incidents which she would follow with passion. She enjoyed suddenly pretending that Francoise was stealing from her, that she herself had been cunning enough to make sure of it, that she had caught her in the act; being in the habit, when she played cards alone, of playing both her own hand and the hand of her opponent, she would utter out loud to herself Francoise's embarrassed excuses and would answer them with so much fire and indignation that if one of us entered at that moment, we found her bathed in perspiration, her eyes sparkling, her false hair dislodged and showing her bald forehead. Francoise would perhaps sometimes hear from the next room mordant pieces of sarcasm that were addressed to her, the invention of which would not have relieved my aunt sufficiently if they had remained in a purely immaterial state and if by murmuring them half-aloud she had not given them more reality. Sometimes, even this 'theatre in bed'28 was not enough for my aunt, she wanted to have her plays performed. And so, on a Sunday, all doors mysteriously closed, she would confide to Eulalie her doubts about Francoise's honesty, her intention of getting rid of her, and another time, to Francoise, her suspicions about the faithlessness of Eulalie, to whom the door would very soon be closed; a few days later, she would be disgusted with her confidant of the day before and once again consort with the traitor, though for the next performance the two of them would exchange roles yet again. But the suspicions that Eulalie was able at times to inspire in her amounted only to a straw fire and died down quickly, for lack of fuel, since Eulalie did not live in the house. It was not the same for those that concerned Francoise, of whose presence under the same roof my aunt was perpetually conscious, though for fear of catching cold if she left her bed, she did not dare go down to the kitchen to verify whether they were well founded. Gradually her mind came to be occupied entirely by attempting to guess what, at each moment, Francoise could be doing and trying to hide from her. She would notice the most furtive movements of Francoise's features, a contradiction in something she said, a desire that she seemed to be concealing. And she would show Francoise that she had unmasked her, with a single word that made Francoise turn pale and that my aunt seemed to find a cruel amusement in driving deep into the heart of the unfortunate woman. And the following Sunday, a revelation of Eulalie's like those discoveries that suddenly open an unsuspected field to a young science that has got into something of a rut would prove to my aunt that her own suppositions were far short of the truth. 'But Francoise ought to know that, now that you've given her a carriage. Given her a carriage! my aunt would cry. Oh, well, I don't know really. I thought, well, I saw her passing just a short time ago in a calash, proud as Artaban,29 going to the market at Roussainville. I thought it was Mme Octave who gave it to her.' And so by degrees Francoise and my aunt, like quarry and hunter, reached the point of constantly trying to anticipate each other's ruses. My mother was afraid Francoise would develop a real hatred for my aunt, who insulted her as brutally as she could. Certainly Francoise came more and more to pay an extraordinary attention to the least of my aunt's remarks, to the least of her gestures. When she had to ask her something, she would hesitate for a long time over how she should go about it. And when she had tendered her",3.3803862328379184,1.1476806822515997,0.4445918859939974,0.07044583875597539,4.397783933518006,4.0,2.345549346581477,42.976190476190474,24.0,39.55495760586546,1.2925207756232686,1.0,0.6478385244206292,1805,682,0.3778393351800554,8164,42,59.73707040557393,8.779707394481052e+25,4.35933832893796e+22,0.8221900070585856,0.8121619105339051,53.866909048938155,16.42245943806886,12.416235457179464,19.65030998549004,20.771657564965047,9.370216066481994,60.98173064239546,7.738095238095238,True,1126.0,0.9016881827209533,4.0536246276067525,2014.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0074267362505018066,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010839020473705338,0.007727820152549177,0.0036130068245684463,0.004965243296921549,26,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"on which they are described, and told us to consult it in order to find out what sort of first aid to give. My mother sent Francoise to get the book, warning her not to let the bookmark fall out. After an hour, Francoise had not returned; my mother, indignant, thought she had gone back to bed and told me to go to the library myself and see. There I found Francoise, who, having wanted to look at what the marker showed, was reading the clinical description of the attack and sobbing, now that the patient was a hypothetical one whom she did not know. At each painful symptom mentioned by the author of the article, she would exclaim: 'Oh dear, Holy Virgin, is it possible that the good Lord would want a wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!' But as soon as I called her and she came back to the bedside of Giotto's Charity, her tears immediately stopped flowing; she could recognize neither the agreeable sensation of pity and tenderness which she knew so well and had so often derived from reading the newspapers, nor any pleasure of the same sort, in the boredom and irritation of having had to get up in the middle of the night for her kitchen-maid; and, at the sight of the same sufferings whose description had made her cry, she now produced nothing more than some bad-tempered mutterings, even some nasty, sarcastic remarks, saying, when she thought we had gone and could not hear her: 'She had only to stop herself from doing what you do to get this way! I'm certain she enjoyed it well enough! So she needn't make a fuss now! Anyways, the boy must have to be quite forsaken by the good Lord to want to go with this one. Oh dear! It's just as they used to say in my poor mother's patois: Qui du cul d'un chien s'amourose, Il lui parait une rose.32 Although, when her grandson had a little cold in the head, she would go off in the night even if she was ill, instead of going to bed, to see if he needed anything, covering four leagues on foot before daybreak in order to be back in time to do her work, this same love of her own people and her desire to ensure the future greatness of her house was expressed, in her policy towards the other servants, by a consistent principle, which was never to let a single one of them become attached to my aunt, whom she took, moreover, a sort of pride in not allowing to be approached by anyone, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get up out of bed in order to give her mistress her Vichy water rather than permit the kitchen-maid access to the bedroom. And like the hymenopteron observed by Fabre,33 the burrowing wasp who, so that its young may have fresh meat to eat after its death, summons anatomy in aid of its cruelty and, after capturing a few weevils and spiders, proceeds with a marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce them in the nerve centre on which depends the movement of their legs but not their other life functions, in such a way that the paralysed insect near which it deposits its eggs provides the larvae, when they hatch, with prey that is docile, harmless, incapable of flight or resistance, but not in the least tainted, Francoise found, to serve her abiding desire to make the house intolerable to any other servant, ruses so clever and so merciless that many years later we learned that if we had eaten asparagus almost every day that summer, it was because their smell provoked in the poor kitchen-girl who was given the job of scraping them attacks of asthma so violent that she was obliged in the end to leave. Alas, we had to change our minds definitively about Legrandin. On one of the Sundays following the meeting on the Pont-Vieux after which my father had had to admit his mistake, as Mass was ending and as something so far from holy was entering the church, with the sunlight and the noise from outdoors, that Mme Goupil, Mme Percepied (all the people who, just a short time before, when I arrived a little late, had kept their eyes absorbed in prayer so that I would have thought they did not even see me come in if, at the same time, their feet had not gently pushed back the little kneeling-bench that was blocking my path to my seat) began to converse with us loudly about quite temporal subjects as if we were already in the square, we saw on the blazing threshold of the porch, looking out over the motley tumult of the market, Legrandin being introduced by the husband of that lady with whom we had just recently encountered him to the wife of another large landowner of the area. Legrandin's face expressed an animation, a zeal, that were quite extraordinary; he made a deep bow with a secondary recoil that brought his back sharply up past its starting position and that must have been taught him by the husband of his sister, Mme de Cambremer. This rapid straightening caused Legran-din's bottom, which I had not supposed was so fleshy, to flow back in a sort of ardent muscular wave; and I do not know why that undulation of pure matter, that quite fleshly billow, with no expression of spirituality and whipped into a storm by a fully contemptible alacrity, suddenly awakened in my mind the possibility of a Legrandin quite different from the one we knew. This lady asked him to say something to her coachman, and as he went over to the carriage, the imprint of timid and devoted joy which the introduction had set upon his face persisted there still. He was smiling, enraptured in a sort of dream, then he hurried back to the lady and, since he was walking more quickly than was his habit, his two shoulders oscillated ridiculously to the right and left, and so entirely did he abandon himself to this, without concern for anything else, that he looked like some inert and mechanical slave of happiness. Meanwhile, we were leaving the porch, we were going to pass right by him, he was too well-mannered to turn his head away, but he fastened his gaze, suddenly burdened by a profound reverie, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us and did not have to greet us. His face remained ingenuous above his straight and supple jacket that looked as though it had been led astray against its will into detestably splendid surroundings. And a polka-dotted Lavalliere bow tie tossed by the wind in the Square continued to float in front of Legrandin like the flag of his proud isolation and noble independence. Just as we reached the house, Mama realized that we had forgotten the Saint-Honore cake and asked my father to go back the way we had come, taking me with him, and tell them to bring it immediately. Near the church we met Legrandin, who was coming in the opposite direction escorting the same lady to her carriage. He passed close to us, did not break off his conversation with his neighbour, and from the corner of his blue eye gave us a little sign that was in some way interior to his eyelid and which, not involving the muscles of his face, could go perfectly unnoticed by the lady he was talking to; but seeking to compensate by intensity of feeling for the somewhat narrow field in which he had circumscribed its expression, in the azure corner assigned to us he set sparkling all the liveliness of a grace that exceeded playfulness, bordered on mischievousness; he over-refined the subtleties of amiability into winks of connivance, insinuations, innuendoes, the mysteries of complicity; and finally exalted his assurances of friendship into protestations of affection, into a declaration of love, illuminating for us alone, at that moment, with a secret languor invisible to the lady, a love-smitten eye in a face of ice. He had in fact asked my parents the day before to send me to dine with him that evening: 'Come and keep your old friend company, he had said to me. Like a bouquet sent to us by a traveller from a country to which we will never return, allow me to breathe from the distance of your adolescence those flowers that belong to the springtimes which I too traversed many years ago. Come with the primrose, the monk's-beard, the buttercup, come with the sedum that makes the bouquet of love in Balzac's flora,34 come with the flower of Resurrection Day, the Easter-daisy and the garden snowdrop, which is beginning to perfume your great-aunt's paths even though the last snows dropped by the Easter showers have not yet melted. Come with the glorious silk raiment of the lily worthy of Solomon himself, and with the polychrome enamel of the pansies, but above all come with the breeze still cool from the last frosts, that will open the petals, for the two butterflies that have waited at its door since morning, of the first Jerusalem rose. At home they wondered if they ought to send me to have dinner with M. Legrandin even so. But my grandmother refused to believe he had been impolite. 'Even you admit that he goes about dressed in very simple clothes, hardly those of a man of high society.' She declared that in any case, and at the very worst, if he had been, it was better to appear not to have noticed. In fact, my father himself, though he was the one most irritated by Legrandin's attitude, may still have harboured a last doubt as to what it meant. It was like any attitude or action that reveals a person's deep and hidden character: it has no connection with anything he has said before, we cannot seek confirmation from the culprit's testimony for he will not confess; we are reduced to the testimony of our own senses concerning which we wonder, confronting this isolated and incoherent memory, if they were not the victims of an illusion; so that these attitudes, the only ones of any importance, often leave us with some doubts. I had dinner with Legrandin on his terrace; the moon was shining: 'This silence has a nice quality, does it not? he said to me; for wounded hearts such as mine, a novelist whom you will read later asserts that the only fit companions are shadow and silence.35 And you know, my child, in life there comes a time, still quite remote for you, when our",3.513680515128685,1.1148015625877212,0.42418002011477907,0.07280525340568575,4.359977949283352,4.0,2.370799761681247,47.73684210526316,31.0,46.37302086032256,1.2998897464167585,1.0,0.6390714641145154,1814,755,0.41620727673649394,8169,38,62.100625741894646,9.331663773073228e+26,4.565393235358722e+23,0.7865132147798667,0.7551787974338772,48.411432716300155,18.366067428770382,13.323128011795099,21.762873556548485,22.973917193756172,9.216604189636165,66.64533163117275,9.026315789473685,True,1095.0,0.8948140900195695,3.9965753424657535,2044.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007824255191092387,0.0033102618116160097,0.0,0.010763209393346379,28,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"weary eyes can tolerate only one light, that which a lovely night like this prepares and distils from the darkness, when our ears cannot listen to any other music but that which is played by the moonlight on the flute of silence. ' I was listening to M. Legrandin's words, which always seemed to me so pleasant; but disturbed by the memory of a woman I had seen recently for the first time, and thinking, now that I knew Legrandin was friends with several of the prominent local aristocracy, that perhaps he knew this one, plucking up my courage I said to him: 'Monsieur, do you know the lady... the ladies of Guermantes?', happy too that in pronouncing this name I was assuming a sort of power over it, by the mere fact of bringing it out of my daydreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of sound. But at the name of Guermantes, I saw a little brown notch appear in the centre of each of our friend's blue eyes as if they had been stabbed by invisible pinpoints, while the rest of the pupil reacted by secreting floods of azure. The arc of his eyelids darkened and drooped. And his mouth, marked by a bitter fold, but recovering more quickly, smiled while his eyes remained sorrowful, like the eyes of a handsome martyr whose body bristles with arrows: 'No, I don't know them,' he said, but instead of giving so simple a piece of information, so unsurprising an answer in the natural, everyday tone that would have been appropriate, he declaimed it stressing each word, bending forward, nodding his head, with the insistence one imparts, so as to be believed, to an improbable statement as though the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to a curious accident of fate and also with the expressive force of a person who, unable to keep silent about a situation that is painful to him, prefers to proclaim it so as to give others the idea that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, is easy, pleasant, spontaneous, that the situation itself the absence of relations with the Guermantes could well have been, not suffered, but desired by him, could result from some family tradition, moral principle or mystical vow specifically forbidding him any association with the Guermantes. 'No, he went on, explaining his own intonation by what he said, no, I don't know them, I've never wanted to, I've always made a point of safeguarding my complete independence; deep down I'm a Jacobin in my thinking, you know. Many people have tried to save me, they told me I was wrong not to go to Guermantes, that I was making myself look like a boor, an old bear. But that's not the sort of reputation that dismays me, it's so very true! Deep down, I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches, two or three books, scarcely more paintings, and the light of the moon when the breeze of your youth brings me the fragrance of the flower-beds that my old eyes can no longer distinguish.' I did not understand very clearly why, in order not to go to the houses of people whom one did not know, it was necessary to cling to one's independence, or how this might make one look like a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was that Legrandin was not being completely truthful when he said he cared only for churches, moonlight and youth; he cared very much for the people from the chateaux and in their presence was overcome by so great a fear of displeasing them that he did not dare let them see that some of his friends were bourgeois people, sons of notaries or stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth was to be revealed, that it be revealed in his absence, far away from him and 'by default'; he was a snob. Certainly he never said any of this in the language my family and I loved so much. And if I asked: 'Do you know the Guermantes?', Legrandin the talker would answer: 'No, I have never wanted to know them.' Unfortunately, he was not the first Legrandin to answer, but the second, because another Legrandin whom he kept carefully concealed deep inside himself, whom he did not exhibit because that Legrandin knew some compromising stories about our own, about his snobbishness, had already answered by the wound in his eyes, by the rictus of his mouth, by the excessive gravity in the tone of his answer, by the thousand arrows with which our own Legrandin had been instantly larded, languishing like a Saint Sebastian of snobbishness: 'Alas! How you hurt me! No, I don't know the Guermantes, do not reawaken the great sorrow of my life.' And since this troublemaker Legrandin, this blackmailer Legrandin, though he did not have the other's pretty language, had the infinitely quicker speech consisting of what are called 'reflexes', when Legrandin the talker wished to impose silence on him, the other had already spoken, and though our friend might grieve over the poor impression that his alter ego's revelations must have produced, he could only attempt to mitigate it. And this certainly does not mean that M. Legrandin was not sincere when he ranted against snobs. He could not be aware, at least from his own knowledge, that he was one, since we are familiar only with the passions of others, and what we come to know about our own, we have been able to learn only from them. Upon ourselves they act only secondarily, by way of our imagination, which substitutes for our primary motives alternative motives that are more seemly. It was never Legrandin's snobbishness that advised him to pay frequent visits to a duchess. It would instruct Legrandin's imagination to make that duchess appear to him as being endowed with all the graces. Legrandin would become acquainted with the duchess, filled with esteem for himself because he was yielding to attractions of wit and virtue unknown to vile snobs. Only other people were aware that he was one himself; for, because they were incapable of understanding the intermediary work of his imagination, they saw, coupled together, Legrandin's social activity and its primary cause. Now we at home no longer had any illusions about M. Legrandin, and our contacts with him became fewer and farther between. Mama was infinitely amused each time she caught Legrandin in flagrante delicto in the sin that he would not confess, that he continued to call the sin without forgiveness, snobbishness. My father, on the other hand, had trouble accepting Legrandin's manifestations of disdain with such detachment and good humour; and when, one year, they thought of sending me to spend my summer vacation at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: 'I absolutely must let Legrandin know that you'll be going to Balbec, to see if he offers to put you in touch with his sister. He probably doesn't remember telling us she lives only a mile from there.' My grandmother, who believed that when staying at a seaside resort one should be on the beach from morning to evening inhaling the salt and that one ought not to know anyone thereabouts because visits and excursions were only so much time taken from the sea air, asked on the contrary that we not speak about our plans to Legrandin, as she could already see his sister, Mme de Cambremer, arriving at the hotel just when we were about to go fishing and forcing us to remain confined indoors entertaining her. But Mama laughed at her fears, thinking privately that the danger was not so great, that Legrandin would not be in such a hurry to put us in touch with his sister. Yet no one had to mention Balbec to him, it was Legrandin himself who, never suspecting that we had any intention of going to those parts, walked into the trap of his own accord one evening when we met him on the banks of the Vivonne. There are very lovely violets and blues in the clouds this evening, are there not, my friend, he said to my father, a blue, especially, more flowery than airy, the blue of a cineraria, which is surprising in the sky. And that little pink cloud, too, has it not the tint of some flower, a sweet william or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, but on the Channel, between Normandy and Britanny, have I made richer observations of this sort of plant kingdom of the atmosphere. There, near Balbec, near those wild areas, there is a little bay, charmingly gentle, where the sunsets of the Auge country, the red and gold sunsets which I do not in the least disdain, let it be said, are characterless, insignificant; but in that damp and mild atmosphere, in the evening, you will see blooming in the space of a few instants celestial bouquets of blue and pink which are incomparable and often last for hours before they fade. There are others that lose their blossoms immediately, and then it is even lovelier to see the entire sky strewn with the scattering of their countless petals, sulphur or pink. In this bay, which they call Opal Bay, the golden beaches seem gentler still because they are chained like blonde Andromedas36 to those terrible rocks of the nearby coast, to that gloomy shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a vessel is lost to the perils of the sea. Balbec! The most ancient geological skeleton of our soil, truly Ar-mor, the Sea,37 the land's end, the accursed region which Anatole France38 an enchanter whom our little friend here ought to read has painted so well, under its eternal fogs, like the veritable country of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey.39 From Balbec especially, where they are already building hotels, superimposing them upon the ancient and charming soil which they cannot change, what a delight it is to go for excursions just a step or two away through regions so primitive and so lovely! Oh, do you know someone in Balbec? asked my father. As it happens, this boy of ours will be spending two months there with his grandmother, and my wife, too, perhaps. Legrandin, caught unprepared by this question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father, could not turn his eyes away, but fastening them more intensely second by second and at the same time smiling sadly to the eyes of his questioner, with an expression of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him full in the face, he seemed to have gone right through that",3.3496121238109513,1.2296640638373202,0.4363191067710481,0.06564504655577168,4.473946784922394,4.0,2.494536768857388,40.08888888888889,30.0,34.913112609716784,1.3253880266075388,1.0,0.6758411152569187,1804,677,0.37527716186252774,8363,45,64.9547136104413,1.6198458762612298e+28,7.8366999335328e+24,0.7689434499056502,0.757987865528395,54.01695072678001,15.684245380635627,13.312825808039673,19.20628726287263,19.68673380142892,9.768447893569842,59.989110618378916,7.977777777777778,True,1114.0,0.8824383164005806,4.045960328979197,2067.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011709141001672734,0.010626783430089541,0.003935845714847978,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008265276001180754,0.0031486765718783823,0.0026566958575223853,0.01741654571843251,29,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"feathers, glazed, even in the shade, by the sun in which they had bathed. A few, half hidden by the little tiled lodge called the Archers' House, where the caretaker lived, overtopped its Gothic gable with their pink minarets. The Nymphs of Spring would have seemed vulgar compared to these young houris, which preserved within this French garden the pure and vivid tones of Persian miniatures. Despite my desire to entwine their supple waists and draw down to me the starry curls of their fragrant heads, we would pass by without stopping because my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann's marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into the park, instead of taking the lane that goes along its fence and climbs directly up to the fields, we would take another that leads to the same place, but obliquely, and that brought us out too far away. One day, my grandfather said to my father: Don't you remember Swann's telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter were going off to Rheims and that he would take the opportunity to spend a day in Paris? We could go along by the park, since the ladies aren't there; it would make the walk that much shorter for us. We stopped for a moment in front of the gate. Lilac-time was nearly over; a few, still, poured forth in tall mauve chandeliers the delicate bubbles of their flowers, but in many places among the leaves where only a week before they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, a hollow scum now withered, shrunken and dark, dry and without perfume. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the look of the place had remained the same, and in what respects it had changed, since the walk he had taken with M. Swann the day of his wife's death, and he used the occasion to tell the story of that walk one more time. In front of us, a path bordered with nasturtiums climbed in full sun towards the house. To the right, the park extended over level ground. Darkened by the shade of the tall trees that surrounded it, an ornamental pond had been dug by Swann's parents; but even in his most artificial creations, man is still working upon nature; certain places will always impose their own particular empire on their surroundings, sport their immemorial insignia in the middle of a park just as they would have done far from any human intervention, in a solitude which returns to surround them wherever they are, arising from the exigencies of the position they occupy and superimposed on the work of human hands. So it was that, at the foot of the path that overlooked the artificial pond, there might be seen in its two rows woven of forget-me-nots and periwinkles, a natural crown, delicate and blue, encircling the chiaroscuro brow of water, and so it was that the sword-lily, bending its blades with a regal abandon, extended over the eupatorium and wet-footed frogbit the ragged fleurs-de-lis, violet and yellow, of its lacustrine sceptre. Mlle Swann's departure, which by taking from me the terrible chance that I might see her appear on a path, that I might be recognized and scorned by the privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and went to visit cathedrals with him made the contemplation of Tansonville a matter of indifference to me the first time it was allowed me, seemed on the contrary to add to that estate, in the eyes of my grandfather and my father, certain accommodations, a transitory charm, and, as does for an excursion into mountain country the absence of any cloud, to make that day exceptionally favourable for a walk in that direction; I would have liked their calculations to be foiled, a miracle to make Mlle Swann appear with her father, so close to us that we would not have time to avoid her and would be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when suddenly I saw on the grass, like a sign of her possible presence, a creel sitting forgotten next to a line whose bob was floating on the water, I hastened to turn my father's and grandfather's eyes away in another direction. In any case, since Swann had told us it was bad of him to go off because he had family at the house just now, the line could belong to one of his guests. We heard no sound of steps on the paths. Dividing the height of an unknown tree, an invisible bird, contriving to make the day seem short, explored the surrounding solitude with one prolonged note, but received from it a retort so unanimous, a repercussion so redoubled by silence and immobility, that one felt it had arrested for ever that moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The light fell so implacably from the now still sky that one would have wanted to elude its attention, and the dormant water itself, whose sleep was perpetually irritated by insects, dreaming no doubt of some imaginary Maelstrom, increased the disturbance into which I had been plunged by the sight of the cork float, by appearing to draw it at full speed over the silent reaches of the reflected sky; almost vertical, it seemed about to dive and I was already wondering if, quite apart from my desire to know her and fear of knowing her, I did not have a duty to warn Mlle Swann that the fish was biting when I had to run to rejoin my father and grandfather, who were calling me, surprised that I had not followed them along the little lane they had already entered which leads up to the fields. I found it all humming with the smell of the hawthorns. The hedge formed a sort of series of chapels that disappeared under the litter of their flowers, heaped into wayside altars; below them, the sun was laying down a grid of brightness on the ground as if it had just passed through a stained-glass window; their perfume spread as unctuous, as delimited in its form as if I were standing before the altar of the Virgin, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, each held out with a distracted air its sparkling bunch of stamens, delicate radiating ribs in the flamboyant style like those which, in the church, perforated the balustrade of the rood screen or the mullions of the window and blossomed out into the white flesh of a strawberry flower. How naive and folksy by comparison the wild roses would seem which, in a few weeks, would also clamber up in full sun the same country lane, in the smooth silk of their blushing bodices undone by a breath. But though I remained there in front of the hawthorns breathing in their invisible, unchanging smell, bringing it into the presence of my thoughts, which did not know what to do with it, then losing it, and then finding it again, absorbing myself in the rhythm that tossed their flowers here and there with youthful high spirits and at unexpected intervals like certain intervals in music, they offered me the same charm endlessly and with an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me study it more deeply, like the melodies you replay a hundred times in succession without descending farther into their secrets. I turned away from them for a moment, to accost them again with renewed strength. I pursued, all the way on to the embankment behind the hedge that rose steeply towards the fields, some lost poppy, a few cornflowers which had lazily stayed behind, which decorated it here and there with their flowerheads like the border of a tapestry on which appears, thinly scattered, the rustic motif that will dominate the panel; infrequent still, spaced out like the isolated houses that announce the approach of a village, they announced to me the immense expanse where the wheat breaks in waves, where the clouds fleece, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting its red flame to the top of its ropes and whipping it in the wind above its greasy black buoy made my heart pound like the heart of a traveller who spies on a lowland a first beached boat being repaired by a caulker and, before catching sight of it, cries out: 'The Sea!' Then I came back to stand in front of the hawthorns as you do in front of those masterpieces which, you think, you will be able to see more clearly when you have stopped looking at them for a moment, but although I formed a screen for myself with my hands so that I would have only them before my eyes, the feeling they awakened in me remained obscure and vague, seeking in vain to detach itself, to come and adhere to their flowers. They did not help me to clarify it, and I could not ask other flowers to satisfy it. Then, filling me with the joy we feel when we see a work by our favourite painter that is different from the ones we knew, or if someone takes us up to a painting of which we had until then seen only a pencil sketch, if a piece heard only on the piano appears to us later clothed in the colours of the orchestra, my grandfather, calling me and pointing to the Tansonville hedge, said to me: 'You love hawthorns just look at this pink one. Isn't it lovely!' Indeed it was a hawthorn, but a pink hawthorn, even more beautiful than the white ones. It, too, wore finery for a holiday for the only true holidays, which are the religious holidays, since they are not assigned by some fortuitous whim, as are the secular holidays, to an ordinary day that is not especially intended for them, that has nothing essentially festal about it but their finery was even more opulent, for the flowers, attached to the branch one above another, in such a way as to leave no spot that was not decorated, like pompoms garlanding a rococo shepherd's crook, were 'in colour', and consequently of a superior quality according to the aesthetics of Combray, if one judged it by the scale of prices in 'the store' in the Square, or at Camus', where the more expensive biscuits were the pink ones. Even I preferred cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed to crush strawberries in it. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of an edible thing, or of a delicate embellishment to an outfit for an important holiday, one of those colours which, because they offer children the reason for their superiority, seem most",3.6505682040991614,1.1594931384295235,0.4330748385127581,0.07538615341728998,4.410171365395246,4.0,2.3814806083013065,54.81818181818182,39.0,45.36415254458254,1.2924267551133222,1.0,0.642301971273953,1809,723,0.3996683250414594,8210,33,65.52661706807513,2.869777395563137e+28,1.4157757254874875e+25,0.8279044330120087,0.8158075223045964,41.85524197195841,21.039726619428112,14.291902434058311,24.713342379014023,26.750998040102516,9.591840796019898,73.28142117694357,10.121212121212121,True,1089.0,0.8978786383818451,4.05032067094228,2027.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008591408591408592,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008391608391608392,0.004395604395604396,0.004495504495504496,0.004440059200789344,31,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"face as though it had become transparent, and to be seeing at that moment, far beyond and behind it, a bright and colourful cloud that created a mental alibi for him and would allow him to prove that at the moment when he had been asked if he knew someone at Balbec, he was thinking of something else and had not heard the question. Usually, such an expression makes the other person say: 'What are you thinking about?' But my father, curious, irritated and cruel, said again: You know Balbec so well do you have friends in the area? In a last desperate effort, Legrandin's smiling gaze reached its highest degree of tenderness, vagueness, sincerity and distraction, but, no doubt thinking there was nothing else he could do but answer, he said to us: I have friends wherever there are companies of trees, wounded but not vanquished, which huddle together with touching obstinacy to implore an inclement and pitiless sky. That was not what I meant, interrupted my father, as obstinate as the trees and as pitiless as the sky. In case something should happen to my mother-in-law and she needed to feel she was not all alone in an out-of-the-way place, I was asking if you knew anyone there? There as everywhere, I know everyone and I know no one, answered Legrandin, who was not going to give in so quickly; I know a great deal about things and very little about people. But in that place the very things themselves seem to be people, rare people, delicate in their very essence, disappointed by life. Sometimes it is a manor house that you encounter on a cliff, by the side of a road, where it has stopped to point its sorrow towards the still pink evening where the golden moon rises while the returning boats, fluting the dappled water, hoist the flame of evening on their masts and carry its colours; sometimes it is a simple solitary house, rather ugly, its expression shy but romantic, which conceals from all eyes some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. This country which is so unreal, he added with a Machiavellian delicacy, this country of pure fiction makes bad reading for a child, and would certainly not be what I would select and recommend for my little friend, already so inclined to sadness, for his heart, already so predisposed. A climate of amorous confession or vain regret may be suitable for a disillusioned old man like me, but they are always unhealthy for a temperament as yet unformed. Please believe me, he went on insistently, the waters of that bay, already half Breton, may act as a sedative, though a questionable one, on a heart like mine that is no longer undamaged, on a heart for whose wounds there is no longer any compensation. They are contra-indicated at your age, my boy. Good night, neighbours,' he added, leaving us with that evasive abruptness which was his habit and, turning back towards us with a doctor's raised finger, he summed up his advice: 'No Balbec before the age of fifty, and even then it must depend on the state of the heart,' he called to us. Although my father talked to him about this again in our subsequent encounters, torturing him with questions, it was a useless effort: like that erudite crook40 who used to employ, in fabricating false palimpsests, a labour and a scholarship a hundredth part of which would have been enough to guarantee him a more lucrative, but honourable position, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would have ended by constructing a whole system of landscape ethics and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy, sooner than admit to us that his own sister lived a mile from Balbec and be obliged to offer us a letter of introduction which would not have been such an object of terror for him had he been absolutely certain as in fact he should have been given his experience of my grandmother's character that we would not have taken advantage of it. We always returned in good time from our walks so that we could pay a visit to my Aunt Leonie before dinner. At the beginning of the season, when the days ended early, when we reached the rue du Saint-Esprit there was still a reflection of the sunset on the windowpanes of the house and a band of crimson deep in the timbers of the Calvary, which was reflected farther off in the pool, a red which, often accompanied by a rather brisk chill, was associated in my mind with the red of the fire over which was roasting the chicken that would allow the poetic pleasure given me by the walk to be succeeded by the pleasure of good eating, warmth and rest. But in the summer, when we returned, the sun was not yet setting; and during the visit we made to my Aunt Leonie, its light, lowering and touching the window, had stopped between the great curtains and the curtain-loops, divided, ramified, filtered, and, encrusting the lemon-wood of the chest of drawers with little pieces of gold, illuminated the room obliquely with the delicacy it acquires in the forest undergrowth. But on certain very rare days, when we returned, the chest had lost its momentary encrustations long before, when we reached the rue du Saint-Esprit there was no reflection of the sunset spread over the window-panes, and the pool at the foot of the Calvary had lost its red, sometimes it was already the colour of opal and a long ray of moonlight that grew broader and broader and broke over all the wrinkles of the water traversed it entirely. Then, as we came near the house, we would see a figure on the doorstep and Mama would say to me: Dear me! There's Francoise, watching for us. Your aunt must be worried; that means we're late. And, without taking the time to remove our things, we would quickly go up to my Aunt Leonie's room to reassure her and show her that, contrary to what she was already imagining, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the 'Guermantes way' and, bless us, when one took that walk, my aunt knew very well one could never be sure what time one would be back. There, Francoise, said my aunt, what did I tell you? Didn't I say they must have gone the Guermantes way? Heavens! How hungry they must be! And your leg of lamb all dried up after waiting so long. What a time to be getting back! Well, imagine that, you went the Guermantes way! But I thought you knew, Leonie, said Mama. I thought Francoise saw us go out the little gate from the kitchen garden. For in the environs of Combray there were two 'ways' which one could go for a walk, in such opposite directions that in fact we left our house by different doors when we wanted to go one way or the other: the Meseglise-la-Vineuse way, which we also called the way by Swann's because we passed in front of M. Swann's estate when we went in that direction, and the Guermantes way. About Meseglise-la-Vineuse, to tell the truth, I never knew anything but the 'way' and some strangers who used to come and stroll around Combray on a Sunday, people whom, this time, even my aunt, along with all the rest of us, 'did not know at all' and whom because of this we assumed to be 'people who must have come from Meseglise'. As for Guermantes, I was to know more about it one day, but only much later; and during the whole of my adolescence, if for me Meseglise was something as inaccessible as the horizon, concealed from view, however far we went, by the folds of a landscape that already no longer resembled the landscape of Combray, Guermantes, on the other hand, appeared to me only as the terminus, more ideal than real, of its own 'way', a sort of abstract geographical expression like the line of the equator, like the pole, like the Orient. So, 'to set off towards Guermantes' in order to go to Meseglise, or the opposite, would have seemed to me an expression as devoid of meaning as to set off towards the east in order to go west. Since my father always talked about the Meseglise way as the most beautiful view of the plain that he knew and about the Guermantes way as a typical river landscape, I gave them, conceiving of them thus as two entities, the cohesion, the unity that belong only to the creations of our mind; the smallest part of either of them seemed to me precious and to manifest their particular excellence, while beside them, before one reached the sacred ground of one or the other, the purely physical paths in the midst of which they were established as the ideal view of the plain and the ideal river landscape were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, for the spectator infatuated with the art of drama, the little streets next to a theatre. But most importantly I set between them, much more than their distances in kilometres, the distance that lay between the two parts of my brain where I thought about them, one of those distances of the mind which not only moves things away from each other, but separates them and puts them on different planes. And that demarcation was made even more absolute because our habit of never going both ways on the same day, in a single walk, but one time the Meseglise way, one time the Guermantes way, shut them off, so to speak, far apart from one another, unknowable by one another, in the sealed and uncommunicating vessels of different afternoons. When we wanted to go in the direction of Meseglise, we would go out (not too early, and even if the sky was overcast, because the walk was not very long and did not take us too far away) as though we were going anywhere at all, through the front door of my aunt's house on the rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith, we would drop our letters in the box, we would tell Theodore from Francoise, as we passed, that she had no more oil or coffee, and we would leave town by the lane that ran along the white gate of M. Swann's park. Before reaching it, we would meet the smell of his lilacs, coming out to greet the strangers. From among the fresh green little hearts of their leaves, the flowers would curiously lift above the gate of the park their tufts of mauve or white",3.290292649149911,1.1327235001504907,0.43631192290808973,0.06699569614605354,4.330764997248211,4.0,2.351852656366002,41.29545454545455,31.5,34.797191334838914,1.2806824435883324,1.0,0.613035768065678,1817,647,0.35608145294441385,8149,44,66.27445157278045,6.062176954251334e+28,2.9089140855332695e+25,0.7937068578808807,0.7800387427920387,56.574378908790734,15.627280107069598,12.20270954787414,18.96177015059789,19.615630409766347,8.948112272977433,58.52165157352279,7.113636363636363,True,1123.0,0.8771593090211133,3.9102687140115164,2084.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021208161624283847,0.017187657050959895,0.010252286661976077,0.010252286661976077,0.010252286661976077,0.010252286661976077,0.009046135289978892,0.006030756859985928,0.005126143330988039,0.01055662188099808,30,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"obviously beautiful to the eyes of children, and for that reason will always seem more vivid and more natural to them than the other tints, even after the children have learned that they did not promise anything for the appetite and had not been chosen by the dressmaker. And certainly, I had felt at once, as I had felt in front of the white hawthorns but with more wonder, that it was in no artificial manner, by no device of human fabrication that the festive intention of the flowers was expressed, but that nature had spontaneously expressed it with the naivety of a village shop-keeper labouring over her wayside altar, by overloading the shrub with these rosettes which were too delicate in their colour and provincially pompadour in their style. At the tops of the branches, like those little rosebushes, their pots hidden in lace paper, whose thin spindles radiated from the altar on the major feast-days, teemed a thousand little buds of a paler tint which revealed, when they began to open, as though at the bottom of a cup of pink marble, reds of a bloody tinge, and expressed even more than the flowers the particular, irresistible essence of the hawthorn which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to flower, could do so only in pink. Inserted into the hedge, but as different from it as a young girl in a party dress among people in everyday clothes who are staying at home, the shrub was all ready for Mary's month, and seemed to form a part of it already, shining there, smiling in its fresh pink outfit, catholic and delicious. Through the hedge we could see within the park a path edged with jasmines, pansies and verbenas between which stocks opened their fresh purses, of a pink as fragrant and faded as an old piece of Cordovan leather, while a long green-painted watering hose, uncoiling its loops over the gravel, sent up at each of the points where it was punctured, over the flowers whose fragrances it imbibed, the prismatic vertical fan of its multicoloured droplets. Suddenly I stopped, I could not move, as happens when something we see does not merely address our eyes, but requires a deeper kind of perception and possesses our entire being. A little girl with reddish blonde hair, who appeared to be coming back from a walk and held a gardening spade in her hand, was looking at us, lifting towards us a face scattered with pink freckles. Her dark eyes shone, and since I did not know then, nor have I learned since, how to reduce a strong impression to its objective elements, since I did not have enough 'power of observation', as they say, to isolate the notion of their colour, for a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her again, the memory of their brilliance would immediately present itself to me as that of a vivid azure, since she was blonde: so that, perhaps if she had not had such dark eyes which struck one so the first time one saw her I would not have been, as I was, in love most particularly with her blue eyes. I looked at her, at first with the sort of gaze that is not merely the messenger of the eyes, but a window at which all the senses lean out, anxious and petrified, a gaze that would like to touch the body it is looking at, capture it, take it away and the soul along with it; then, so afraid was I that at any second my grandfather and my father, noticing the girl, would send me off, telling me to run on a little ahead of them, with a second sort of gaze, one that was unconsciously supplicating, that tried to force her to pay attention to me, to know me! She cast her eyes forwards and sideways in order to take stock of my grandfather and father, and no doubt the impression she formed of them was that we were absurd, for she turned away and with an indifferent and disdainful look, placed herself at an angle to spare her face from being in their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, passed beyond me, she allowed her glances to stream out at full length in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to see me, but with a concentration and a secret smile that I could only interpret, according to the notions of good breeding instilled in me, as a sign of insulting contempt; and at the same time her hand sketched an indecent gesture for which, when it was directed in public at a person one did not know, the little dictionary of manners I carried inside me supplied only one meaning, that of intentional insolence. Gilberte, come here! What are you doing? came the piercing, authoritarian cry of a lady in white whom I had not seen, while, at some distance from her, a gentleman dressed in twill whom I did not know stared at me with eyes that started from his head; the girl abruptly stopped smiling, took her spade and went away without turning back towards me, with an air that was docile, inscrutable and sly. So it was that this name Gilberte passed by close to me, given to me like a talisman that might one day enable me to find her again, this girl whom it had just turned into a person and who, a moment before, had been merely an uncertain image. So it passed, spoken over the jasmines and the stocks, as sour and as cool as the drops from the green watering hose; impregnating, colouring the portion of pure air that it had crossed and that it isolated with the mystery of the life of the girl it designated for the happy creatures who lived, who travelled in her company; deploying under the pink thicket, at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity, for me so painful, with her and with the unknown territory of her life which I would never be able to enter. For a moment (as we moved away, my grandfather murmuring: 'Poor Swann, what a role they make him play: they make him leave so that she can stay there alone with her Charlus because it was him, I recognized him! And the little girl, mixed up in that disgraceful business!') the impression left in me by the despotic tone with which Gilberte's mother had spoken to her without her answering back, by presenting her to me as someone obliged to obey another person, as not being superior to everything in the world, calmed my suffering a little, restored some of my hope and diminished my love. But very soon that love welled up in me again like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was trying to put itself on the same level as Gilberte or bring her down to its own. I loved her, I was sorry I had not had the time or the inspiration to insult her, hurt her, and force her to remember me. I thought her so beautiful that I wished I could retrace my steps and shout at her with a shrug of my shoulders: 'I think you're ugly, I think you're grotesque, I loathe you!' But I went away, carrying with me for ever, as the first example of a type of happiness inaccessible to children of my kind because of certain laws of nature impossible to transgress, the image of a little girl with red hair, her skin scattered with pink freckles, holding a spade and smiling as she cast at me long, cunning and inexpressive glances. And already the charm with which the incense of her name had imbued that place under the pink hawthorns where it had been heard by her and by me together, was beginning to reach, to overlay, to perfume everything that came near it, her grandparents, whom my own had had the ineffable happiness of knowing, the sublime profession of stockbroker, the harrowing neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysees where she lived in Paris. 'Leonie, said my grandfather when we returned, I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would not recognize Tansonville. If I had dared, I would have cut you a branch of those pink hawthorns you used to love so much.' And so my grandfather told Aunt Leonie the story of our walk, either to entertain her or because they had not lost all hope of inducing her to go outdoors. For at one time she had liked that estate very much, and, too, Swann's visits had been the last she had received, when she had already closed her door to everyone else. And just as, when he now called to inquire after her (she was the only person in our house he still asked to see), she would tell them to answer him that she was tired, but that she would let him come in the next time, so she said, that evening: 'Yes, some day when it's nice out, I'll take the carriage and go as far as the gate of the park.' She said it sincerely. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but this desire was enough for what strength remained to her; its fulfilment would have exceeded her strength. Sometimes the good weather restored a little of her energy, she would get up, get dressed; the fatigue would set in before she had gone into the other room and she would ask to go back to bed. What had begun for her earlier, merely, than it usually happens was the great renunciation which comes with old age as it prepares for death, wraps itself in its chrysalis, and which may be observed at the ends of lives that are at all prolonged, even in old lovers who have loved each other the most, even between friends bound by the closest ties of mutual sympathy, who, after a certain year, stop making the necessary journey or outing to see each other, stop writing to each other and know they will not communicate again in this world. My aunt must have known perfectly well that she would not see Swann again, that she would never again leave the house, but this final seclusion must have been made fairly comfortable to her for the very reason that, in our eyes, ought to have made it more painful for her: it was that this seclusion was required of her by the diminution in her strength which she could observe each day and which, making each action, each movement, a cause of fatigue, if not pain, in her eyes gave inaction,",3.842121444984617,1.449835857581276,0.4207369750793359,0.051067028723629775,4.295290858725762,4.0,2.33242944833658,53.088235294117645,44.0,37.18504415286499,1.2637119113573407,1.0,0.6139979022196589,1805,671,0.3717451523545706,7999,34,64.06397925348733,6.647107134475155e+27,3.2567893848481897e+24,0.8247530135241422,0.7983854170888662,46.04041347563958,20.026212318722504,13.681092451943961,23.80593123676063,25.344937591657164,8.898747922437675,70.2627505295747,9.117647058823529,True,1137.0,0.8878000979911808,3.919157275845174,2041.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0061230737830390855,0.0027553832023675885,0.0,0.0014698677119059284,32,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"isolation, silence, the restorative and blessed sweetness of repose. My aunt did not go to see the hedge of pink hawthorns, but again and again I asked my parents if she would not go, if at one time she had often gone to Tansonville, trying to make them talk about Mlle Swann's parents and grandparents, who seemed to me as great as gods. When I was talking with my parents, I pined from the need to hear them say that name, Swann, which had become almost mythological for me, I did not dare pronounce it myself, but I drew them on to subjects that were close to Gilberte and her family, that concerned them, in which I did not feel I was exiled too far from them; and I would suddenly compel my father, by pretending to believe, for instance, that my grandfather's appointment had already been in our family before his time, or that the hedge of pink hawthorns which my Aunt Leonie wanted to see was on communal land, to correct what I had said, to say to me, as though despite me, as though of his own accord: 'No, that appointment belonged to Swann's father, that hedge is part of Swann's park.' Then I had to catch my breath, so effectively did that name, coming to rest as it did on the spot where it was always written inside me, oppress me to the point of suffocation, that name which, at the moment I heard it, seemed to me more massive than any other name because it was heavy with all the times I had uttered it beforehand in my mind. It gave me a pleasure that I was embarrassed at having dared to demand from my parents, because that pleasure was so great that it must have required considerable effort on their part to procure it for me, and without compensation, since it was not a pleasure for them. And so I would turn the conversation in another direction out of discretion. Out of compunction, too. All the odd allurements that I invested in this name Swann I would hear in it again when they pronounced it. Then it would suddenly seem to me that my parents could not fail to experience these allurements, that they must share my point of view, that they in their turn perceived, forgave, embraced my dreams, and I was unhappy, as if I had defeated them and corrupted them. That year, when my parents had decided which day we would be returning to Paris, a little earlier than usual, on the morning of our departure, after they had my hair curled for a photograph, and carefully placed on my head a hat I had never worn before and dressed me in a quilted velvet coat, after looking for me everywhere, my mother found me in tears on the steep little path beside Tansonville, saying good-bye to the hawthorns, putting my arms around the prickly branches, and, like the princess in the tragedy burdened by vain ornaments, ungrateful to the importunate hand that with such care had gathered my hair in curls across my brow,41 trampling underfoot my torn-out curl papers and my new hat. My mother was not moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my crushed hat and ruined coat. I did not hear it: 'Oh my poor little hawthorns, I said, weeping, you're not the ones trying to make me unhappy, you aren't forcing me to leave. You've never hurt me! So I will always love you.' And, drying my tears, I promised them that when I was grown up I would not let my life be like the senseless lives of other men and that even in Paris, on spring days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would go out into the countryside to see the first hawthorns. Once in the fields, we did not leave them again during the rest of our walk towards Meseglise. They were perpetually crossed, as though by an invisible vagabond, by the wind that was for me the presiding spirit of Combray. Each year, the day we arrived, in order to feel that I was really in Combray, I would go up to find it again where it ran along the furrows and made me run after it. We always had the wind beside us when we went the Meseglise way, over that cambered plain where for miles it encounters no rise or fall in the land. I knew that Mlle Swann often went to Laon to spend a few days, and even though it was several miles away, since the distance was compensated for by the absence of any obstacle, when, on hot afternoons, I saw a single gust of wind, coming from the farthest horizon, first bend the most distant wheat, then roll like a wave through all that vast expanse and come to lie down murmuring and warm among the sainfoin and clover at my feet, this plain which was shared by us both seemed to bring us together, join us, and I would imagine that this breath of wind had passed close to her, that what it whispered to me was some message from her though I could not understand it, and I would kiss it as it went by. On the left was a village called Champieu (Campus pagani, according to the cure). To the right, you could see beyond the wheat the two chiselled rustic spires of Saint-Andre-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, imbricated, chequered, yellowing and granulose as two spikes of wheat. At symmetrical intervals, in the midst of the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves, which cannot be confused with the leaves of any other fruit tree, the apple trees opened their broad petals of white satin or dangled the timid bouquets of their reddening buds. It was on the Meseglise way that I first noticed the round shadow that apple trees make on the sunny earth and those silks of impalpable gold which the sunset weaves obliquely under the leaves, and which I saw my father interrupt with his stick without ever deflecting them. Sometimes in the afternoon sky the moon would pass white as a cloud, furtive, lustreless, like an actress who does not have to perform yet and who, from the audience, in street clothes, watches the other actors for a moment, making herself inconspicuous, not wanting anyone to pay attention to her. I liked finding its image again in paintings and books, but these works of art were quite different at least during the early years, before Bloch accustomed my eyes and my mind to subtler harmonies from those in which the moon would seem beautiful to me today and in which I would not have recognized it then. It might be, for example, some novel by Saintine,42 some landscape by Gleyre43 in which it stands out distinctly against the sky in the form of a silver sickle, one of those works which were naively incomplete, like my own impressions, and which it angered my grandmother's sisters to see me enjoy. They thought that one ought to present to children, and that children showed good taste in enjoying right from the start, those works of art which, once one has reached maturity, one will admire for ever after. The fact is that they probably regarded aesthetic merits as material objects which an open eye could not help perceiving, without one's needing to ripen equivalents of them slowly in one's own heart. It was along the Meseglise way, at Montjouvain, a house situated at the edge of a large pond and backed up against a brush-covered hillock, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we often met his daughter on the road driving a cabriolet at top speed. One year, she was not alone when we met her, and from then on she was always accompanied by an older friend, a woman who had a bad reputation in the area and who one day moved permanently into Montjouvain. People said: 'Poor M. Vinteuil must be blind with love not to realize what kind of rumours are going around a man who is shocked by a single remark out of place letting his daughter bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He says she's a most superior woman, with a good heart, and that she would have had an extraordinary aptitude for music if she had cultivated it. He can be sure she's not dabbling in music when she's with his daughter.' M. Vinteuil did say this; and in fact it is remarkable how a person always inspires admiration for her moral qualities in the family of the person with whom she is having carnal relations. Physical love, so unfairly disparaged, compels people to manifest the very smallest particles they possess of goodness, of self-abnegation, so much so that these particles glow even in the eyes of those immediately surrounding them. Doctor Percepied, whose loud voice and thick eyebrows permitted him to play as much as he liked the role of villain which his general appearance belied, without in the least compromising his unshakeable and undeserved reputation as a kindly old curmudgeon, was capable of making the cure and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying gruffly: 'Well, now! It seems young Mlle Vinteuil is making music with her friend. You seem surprised. Now I don't know. It was old Vinteuil who told me just yesterday. After all, the girl certainly has a right to enjoy her music. It's not for me to go against a child's artistic vocation. Nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he himself plays music with his daughter's friend, as well. Heaven help us! There's certainly a good deal of music-making going on in that establishment. Well, why are you laughing? They play too much music, those people. The other day I met old Vinteuil near the cemetery. He was ready to drop.' For those like us who saw M. Vinteuil at that time avoiding people he knew, turning away when he saw them, ageing in a few months, immersing himself in his sorrow, becoming incapable of any effort whose direct goal was not his daughter's happiness, spending whole days before the grave of his wife it would have been difficult not to realize that he was dying of sorrow, or to imagine that he was not aware of the talk that was going around. He knew about it, maybe he even believed it. Perhaps there exists no one, however virtuous he may be, who may not be led, one day, by the complexity of his circumstances to live on familiar terms with the vice he condemns most expressly without his fully recognizing it,",3.1252701979508477,1.0614229829854493,0.4198475666428661,0.06301264679726615,4.322099447513812,4.0,2.3647054904170486,32.90909090909091,27.0,31.31440140793354,1.2823204419889502,1.0,0.6141671151919729,1810,694,0.3834254143646409,8088,55,63.94803471424787,5.919412495869352e+27,2.8847039453554346e+24,0.7668702878333904,0.7344026857951902,64.94796333500754,12.375926670015065,11.281258264143084,15.638774485183326,15.381633852335511,8.71449723756906,50.14665996986439,5.672727272727273,True,1121.0,0.8913255360623782,3.9415204678362574,2052.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0054611650485436895,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006067961165048544,0.0027305825242718447,0.0,0.013157894736842105,33,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"have folded their sails and stand motionless out at sea all night long. But what did the rain matter, what did the storm matter! In summer, bad weather is only a passing, superficial mood on the part of the steady, underlying good weather, which is very different from the fluid and unstable good weather of winter, and having settled on the earth, where it has taken solid form in dense branches of leaves on which the rain may drip without compromising the resistance of their permanent joy, has hoisted for the whole season, even in the streets of the village, on the walls of the houses and gardens, its colours of white or violet silk. Sitting in the little drawing-room, where I waited for the dinner hour while I read, I would hear the water dripping from our chestnut trees, but I knew that the downpour was only varnishing their leaves and that they would promise to stay there, like pledges of summer, all the rainy night, ensuring that the good weather would continue; that rain as it might, tomorrow little heart-shaped leaves would undulate just as numerous above the white gate of Tansonville; and it was without sadness that I saw the poplar in the rue des Perchamps meet the storm praying and bowing in despair; it was without sadness that I heard at the back of the garden the last rolls of thunder warbling among the lilacs. If the weather was bad in the morning, my parents would give up the walk and I would not go out. But I later acquired the habit of going out to walk alone on those days along the Meseglise-la-Vineuse way, during the autumn in which we had to come to Combray to settle my Aunt Leonie's estate, because she had at last died, proving correct both those who had claimed that her enfeebling regimen would end by killing her, and also those who had always maintained that she suffered from an illness that was not imaginary but organic, to the evidence of which the sceptics would certainly be obliged to yield when she succumbed to it; and causing no great suffering by her death except to a single person, but to that one, a grief that was savage. During the two weeks of my aunt's final illness, Francoise did not leave her for an instant, did not undress, did not allow anyone else to care for her in any way, and did not leave her body until it was buried. Then we realized that the kind of dread in which Francoise had lived, of my aunt's ill-natured remarks, suspicions, angry moods, had developed a feeling in her that we had taken for hatred and that was actually veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions were impossible to foresee, whose ruses were difficult to foil, whose good heart was easy to touch, her sovereign, her mysterious and all-powerful monarch, was no longer. Next to her we counted for very little. The time was by now far in the past when, as we began coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we possessed as much prestige as my aunt in Francoise's eyes. That autumn, completely occupied as they were with the formalities that had to be observed, the interviews with notaries and tenants, my parents, having scarcely any time to go on excursions, which the weather frustrated in any case, fell into the habit of letting me go for walks without them along the Meseglise way, wrapped in a great plaid that protected me from the rain and that I threw over my shoulders all the more readily because I sensed that its Scottish patterning scandalized Francoise, into whose mind one could not have introduced the idea that the colour of one's clothes had nothing to do with mourning and to whom, in any case, the sorrow that we felt over the death of my aunt was not very satisfactory, because we had not offered a large funeral dinner, because we did not adopt a special tone of voice in speaking of her, because I even hummed to myself now and then. I am sure that in a book and in this I was actually quite like Francoise such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the Chanson de Roland45 and the portal of Saint-Andre-des-Champs, would have appealed to me. But as soon as Francoise was near me, some demon would goad me to try to make her angry, I would seize the slightest pretext to tell her that I missed my aunt because she was a good woman despite her ridiculous ways, but not in the least because she was my aunt, that she might have been my aunt and still seemed odious to me, and then her death would not have caused me any pain, remarks that would have seemed to me inept in a book. If Francoise then, filled like a poet with a flood of confused thoughts about bereavement, about family memories, excused herself for not knowing how to answer my theories and said: 'I don't know how to espress myself,' I would gloat over that admission with an ironic and brutal common sense worthy of Doctor Percepied; and if she added: 'All the same, she was your own kith and kindred,46 and there's a proper respect we owe to our kith and kindred, you know,' I would shrug my shoulders and say to myself: 'Look at me, arguing with an illiterate woman who makes such blunders,' adopting, in judging Francoise, the mean-spirited attitude of men whose behaviour those people who despise them the most when contemplating them impartially are quite capable of adopting, when actually playing one of life's vulgar scenes. My walks that autumn were all the more pleasant because I took them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired from reading all morning in the parlour, throwing my plaid over my shoulders I would go out: my body, which had had to keep still for so long, but which had accumulated, as it sat, a reserve of animation and speed, now needed, like a top that has been released, to expend them in all directions. The walls of the houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of the Roussainville woods, the thickets at the back of Montjou-vain, submitted to the blows of my umbrella or walking stick, heard my shouts of joy, these being both merely confused ideas that exhilarated me and found no repose in the light of understanding, because they had preferred, instead of a slow and difficult clarification, the pleasure of an easier diversion towards an immediate outcome. Most of the supposed expressions of our feelings merely relieve us of them in this way by drawing them out of us in an indistinct form that does not teach us to know them. When I try to count up what I owe to the Meseglise way, the humble discoveries for which it was the fortuitous setting or the necessary inspiration, I recall that it was that autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy hillock that protects Montjouvain, that I was struck for the first time by this discord between our impressions and their habitual expression. After an hour of rain and wind which I had fought cheerfully, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, beside a little hut covered in tiles where M. Vinteuil's gardener stowed his gardening tools, the sun had just reappeared, and its gildings, washed by the downpour, glistened freshly in the sky, on the trees, on the wall of the hut, on its still wet tile roof along the crest of which a hen was walking. The wind that was blowing pulled the wild grass growing in the side of the wall and the downy plumage of the hen, the one and the other streaming out at full length horizontally before its breath, with the abandon of things that are weightless and inert. In the pond, reflective again under the sun, the tile roof made a pink marbling to which I had never before given any attention. And seeing on the water and on the face of the wall a pale smile answering the smile of the sky, I cried out to myself in my enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: 'Damn, damn, damn, damn.' But at the same time I felt I was in duty bound not to stop at these opaque words, but to try to see more clearly into my rapture. And it was at that moment, too because of a countryman who was passing by, who seemed rather cross already and was more so when my umbrella nearly went in his face, and who responded without warmth to my 'fine weather, isn't it, perfect for a walk' that I learned that the same emotions do not arise simultaneously, in a pre-established order, in all men. Later, each time a rather prolonged session of reading had put me in a mood to chat, the friend I was so eager to talk to would himself have just been indulging in the pleasure of conversation and now wanted to be left to read in peace. If I had just been thinking tenderly about my parents and making the wisest decisions, those most likely to please them, they would have been employing the same time in discovering some peccadillo I had forgotten, and they would reproach me severely for it just at the moment I bounded towards them to give them a hug. Sometimes the exhilaration I felt at being alone was joined by another kind that I was not able to separate distinctly from it, and that came from my desire to see a peasant-girl appear in front of me whom I could clasp in my arms. Born suddenly, and without my having had time to identify exactly what had caused it, from among very different thoughts, the pleasure which accompanied it seemed to me only one degree higher than that which those other thoughts had given me. Everything that was in my mind at that moment acquired an even greater value, the pink reflection of the tile roof, the wild grass, the village of Roussainville to which I had been wanting to go for so long now, the trees of its woods, the steeple of its church, as a result of this new emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to carry me towards them more rapidly when it filled my sail with a powerful, mysterious and propitious wind. But if, for me, this desire that a woman should appear added something more exhilarating to the charms of nature, the charms of nature,",3.9570882425374343,1.1489509796274464,0.4458818220262729,0.05339935880371745,4.327453142227123,4.0,2.3218786867312775,56.6875,44.0,38.03816956361071,1.282800441014333,1.0,0.6211644707782694,1814,678,0.3737596471885336,8080,32,65.73765415406888,3.5440549944210424e+28,1.7441215523725603e+25,0.8712419694469821,0.86506720383962,40.77227019018744,21.65517020396913,13.477294815401379,24.99032524807056,27.296054299889747,9.12326350606395,74.76908765159868,10.25,True,1118.0,0.8976377952755905,3.9763779527559056,2032.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010222672064777328,0.005870445344129555,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009615384615384616,0.0024291497975708503,0.0,0.010826771653543307,35,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"moreover, in the disguise of particular details that it assumes in order to come into contact with him in that way and make him suffer: strange remarks, an inexplicable attitude, one evening, on the part of someone whom he has otherwise so many reasons for liking. But a man like M. Vinteuil must have suffered much more than most in resigning himself to one of those situations which are wrongly believed to be the exclusive prerogative of the bohemian life: they occur whenever a vice which nature itself plants in a child, like the colour of its eyes, sometimes merely by mingling the virtues of its father and mother, needs to reserve for itself the space and the security it requires. But the fact that M. Vinteuil perhaps knew about his daughter's behaviour does not imply that his worship of her would thereby be diminished. Facts do not find their way into the world in which our beliefs reside; they did not produce our beliefs, they do not destroy them; they may inflict on them the most constant refutations without weakening them, and an avalanche of afflictions or ailments succeeding one another without interruption in a family will not make it doubt the goodness of its God or the talent of its doctor. But when M. Vinteuil thought about his daughter and himself from the point of view of society, from the point of view of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself with her in the rank which they occupied in the general esteem, then he made this social judgment exactly as it would have been made by the most hostile inhabitant of Combray, he saw himself and his daughter in the lowest depths, and because of this his manner had recently acquired that humility, that respect for those who were above him and whom he saw from below (even if they had been well below him until then), that tendency to seek to climb back up to them, which is an almost automatic result of any downfall. One day as we were walking with Swann down a street in Combray, M. Vinteuil, who was emerging from another, found himself face to face with us too suddenly to have time to avoid us; and Swann, with the proud charity of a man of the world who, in the midst of the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another man's disgrace merely a reason for showing him a kindliness whose manifestations are all the more gratifying to the self-regard of the one offering them because he feels they are so precious to the one receiving them, had conversed with M. Vinteuil for a long time, although he had never spoken to him before then, and before leaving us had asked him if he would not send his daughter to play at Tansonville some day. This was an invitation which two years before would have incensed M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with such feelings of gratitude that he believed he was obliged by them not to have the indiscretion of accepting it. Swann's friendliness towards his daughter seemed to him in itself so honourable and so delightful a support that he thought it would perhaps be better not to make use of it, so as to have the wholly platonic pleasure of preserving it. What a charming man, he said, when Swann had left us, with the same enthusiastic veneration that causes bright and pretty middle-class women to be awed and entranced by a duchess, even if she is ugly and foolish. What a charming man! How unfortunate that he should have made such an entirely inappropriate marriage! And then, since even the most sincere people have a streak of hypocrisy in them which makes them put to one side their opinion of a person while they are talking to him, and express it as soon as he is no longer present, my parents deplored Swann's marriage along with M. Vinteuil in the name of principles and conventions which (by the very fact that they joined him in invoking them, as decent people of the same stamp) they seemed to be implying he had not violated at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to Swann's house. And Swann was the first to regret it. For each time he left M. Vinteuil, he remembered that for some time now he had had a question to ask him about a person who bore the same name, a relative of his, he believed. And this time he had truly promised himself not to forget what he wanted to tell him when M. Vinteuil sent his daughter to Tansonville. Since the walk along the Meseglise way was the shorter of the two that we took out of Combray and since, because of that, we saved it for uncertain weather, the climate along the Meseglise way was quite rainy and we would never lose sight of the skirt of the Roussainville woods, in the thickness of which we could take cover. Often the sun would hide behind a storm cloud, distorting its oval, yellowing the edges of the cloud. The brilliance though not the brightness would disappear from the countryside where all life seemed suspended, while the little village of Roussainville sculpted its white rooftops in relief against the sky with an overpowering precision and finish. A little wind would make a crow fly up and then drop down again in the distance, and against the whitening sky the distant parts of the woods would appear bluer, as though painted in one of those monochromes that decorate the pier glasses of old houses. But at other times the rain with which we had been threatened by the little hooded monk in the optician's window44 would begin to fall; the drops of water, like migrating birds which take flight all at the same time, would descend in close ranks from the sky. They do not separate at all, they do not wander away during their rapid course, but each one keeps to its place, drawing along the one that comes after it, and the sky is more darkened by them than when the swallows leave. We would take refuge in the woods. When their flight seemed to be over, a few of them, feebler, slower, would still be arriving. But we would come back out of our shelter, because raindrops delight in leafy branches, and, when the earth was already nearly dry again, more than one still lingered to play on the ribs of a leaf and, hanging from the tip, tranquil and sparkling in the sun, would suddenly let go, slip off, and drop from the entire height of the branch on to our nose. Often, too, we would go and take shelter all crowded in together with the stone saints and patriarchs in the porch of Saint-Andre-des-Champs. How French that church was! Above the door, the saints, the knight-kings with fleurs-de-lis in their hands, wedding and funeral scenes, were depicted as they might have been in Francoise's soul. The sculptor had also narrated certain anecdotes involving Aristotle and Virgil just as Francoise in her kitchen readily talked about Saint Louis as if she had known him personally, usually in order to put my grandparents to shame by comparison since they were less 'fair-minded'. One felt that the notions which the medieval artist and the medieval countrywoman (living on into the nineteenth century) had acquired of ancient or Christian history, and which were distinguished by containing as much inaccuracy as simple good-heartedness, were derived not from books, but from a tradition that was at once very old and very direct, uninterrupted, oral, deformed, hardly recognizable, and alive. Another Combray character whom I also recognized, potential and prophesied, in the Gothic sculpture of Saint-Andre-des-Champs, was young Theodore, the delivery boy from Camus's grocery. Francoise, in fact, sensed so clearly that he was a fellow countryman and a contemporary that when my Aunt Leonie was too sick for Francoise by herself to turn her over in bed, or carry her to the armchair, instead of letting the kitchen-maid come up and get into my aunt's 'good books' she would send for Theodore. Now this boy, who was taken, and rightly, for such a ne'er-do-well, was so filled with the same spirit that had decorated Saint-Andre-des-Champs and especially with the feelings of respect that Francoise believed were owed to 'poor sick folk', to 'her poor mistress', that as he raised my aunt's head on her pillow he had the same naive and zealous expression as the little angels in the bas-reliefs, crowding around the fainting Virgin with tapers in their hands, as if the faces of sculpted stone, bare and grey as the woods in winter, were only a deep sleep, a reserve, about to blossom into life again in numberless common faces, reverent and crafty like Theodore's, illuminated with the redness of a ripe apple. No longer affixed to the stone like those little angels, but detached from the porch, of larger than human size, standing on a pedestal as though on a stool that spared her putting her feet on the damp ground, one saint had the full cheeks, the firm breast swelling the folds of the cloth like a cluster of ripe grapes in a bag, the narrow forehead, the short and saucy nose, the deep-set eyes, the able-bodied, impassive and courageous demeanour of the countrywomen of the region. This resemblance, which insinuated into the statue a sweetness I had not looked for in it, was often authenticated by some girl from the fields, who, like us, had come to take cover, and whose presence, like the presence of the leaves of a climbing plant that has grown up next to some sculpted leaves, seemed intended to allow us, by confronting it with nature, to judge the truthfulness of the work of art. Before us in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had already stopped for us, continuing to be punished like a biblical village by all the cudgels of the storm, which beat down obliquely on the dwellings of its inhabitants, or had already been pardoned by God the Father, who caused to descend upon it, unequal in length, like the rays of an altar monstrance, the frayed golden shafts of his reappearing sun. Sometimes the weather was completely spoiled, we had to go back home and stay shut up in the house. Here and there, far off in the countryside, which because of the dark and the wet resembled the sea, a few isolated houses, clinging to the side of a hill plunged in watery night, shone forth like little boats that",3.5852455809878316,1.1475269211615686,0.4371532066530839,0.06284022879747218,4.464873765093304,4.0,2.384229644860678,47.94736842105263,41.0,34.003829016915645,1.305159165751921,1.0,0.6417300915036989,1822,711,0.3902305159165752,8383,38,63.49122357020758,3.7487635265912894e+27,1.8242158280249584e+24,0.8415470429368921,0.8345405144823922,47.75195563001908,18.5103518400832,13.238528806291367,21.791461089606564,23.57323964411578,9.836114160263449,67.48633658790224,9.368421052631579,True,1107.0,0.8924574209245743,4.079318734793187,2055.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026121967985858783,0.011980752234115682,0.00707060787587155,0.004910144358244132,0.0,0.0,0.010605911813807326,0.0031424923892762447,0.003535303937935775,0.012165450121654502,34,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"in return, broadened what would have been too narrow in the woman's charm. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was also hers and that the soul of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books I was reading that year, would be given to me by her kiss; and as my imagination drew strength from contact with my sensuality, as my sensuality spread through all the domains of my imagination, my desire grew boundless. And, too just as during those moments of reverie in the midst of nature when, the effect of habit being suspended, and our abstract notions of things set aside, we believe with a profound faith in the originality, in the individual life of the place in which we happen to be the passing woman summoned by my desire seemed to be, not an ordinary exemplar of that general type woman but a necessary and natural product of this particular soil. For at that time everything which was not I, the earth and other people, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they would have appeared to a grown man. And I made no distinction between earth and people. I desired a peasant girl from Meseglise or Roussainville, a fisherwoman from Balbec, just as I desired Meseglise and Balbec. The pleasure they might give me would have appeared less real to me, I would no longer have believed in it, if I had modified its conditions as I pleased. To meet a fisherwoman from Balbec or a countrywoman from Meseglise in Paris would have been like receiving a sea-shell I could not have seen on the beach, a fern I could not have found in the woods, it would have subtracted from the pleasure which the woman would give me all those pleasures in which my imagination had enveloped her. But to wander through the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to hold in my arms was to see these woods and yet know nothing of their hidden treasure, their profound beauty. For me that girl, whom I could only envisage dappled with leaves, was herself like a local plant, merely of a higher species than the rest and one whose structure enabled one to come closer than one could in the others to the essential flavour of the country. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would allow me to reach that flavour would themselves be of a special kind, one whose pleasure I would not have been able to experience through anyone else but her) because I was, and would be for a long time to come, at an age when one has not yet abstracted this pleasure from the possession of the different women with whom one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general notion that makes one regard them from then on as the interchangeable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. This pleasure does not even exist, isolated, distinct and formulated in the mind, as the aim we are pursuing when we approach a woman, as the cause of the previous disturbance that we feel. We scarcely even contemplate it as a pleasure which we will enjoy; rather, we call it her charm; for we do not think of ourselves, we think only of leaving ourselves. Obscurely awaited, immanent and hidden, it merely rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment of its realization, the other pleasures we find in the soft gazes, the kisses of the woman close to us, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of our gratitude for our companion's goodness of heart and for her touching predilection for us, which we measure by the blessings, by the beatitude she showers upon us. Alas, it was in vain that I implored the castle-keep of Roussainville, that I asked it to have some child from its village come to me, appealing to it as to the only confidant I had had of my earliest desires, when at the top of our house in Combray in the little room smelling of orris-root, I could see nothing but its tower in the middle of the pane of the half-open window, while with the heroic hesitations of a traveller embarking on an exploration or of a desperate man killing himself, with a feeling of faintness, I would clear an unknown and I thought fatal path within myself, until the moment when a natural trail like that left by a snail added itself to the leaves of the wild blackcurrant that leaned in towards me. In vain did I appeal to it now. In vain did I hold the whole expanse of the country before me within the field of my vision, draining it with my eyes which tried to extract a woman from it. I would go as far as the porch of Saint-Andre-des-Champs; there I would never find the countrywoman I would inevitably have met had I been with my grandfather and therefore prevented from striking up a conversation with her. I would stare endlessly at the trunk of a distant tree from behind which she was going to appear and come to me; the scanned horizon would remain uninhabited, night would fall, hopelessly my attention would attach itself, as though to aspirate the creatures they might harbour, to that sterile ground, to that exhausted earth; and it was no longer with a light heart, but with rage, that I struck the trees of the Roussainville woods, from among which no more living creatures emerged than if they had been trees painted on the canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to going back to the house without having held in my arms the woman I had so desired, I was nevertheless obliged to continue along the road to Combray admitting to myself that there was less and less chance that she had been placed in my path. And if she had been there, would I have dared talk to her? It seemed to me she would have thought I was mad; I no longer believed that the desires which I formed during my walks, and which were not fulfilled, were shared by other people, that they had any reality outside of me. They now seemed to me no more than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creations of my temperament. They no longer had any attachment to nature, to reality, which from then on lost all its charm and significance and was no more than a conventional framework for my life, as is, for the fiction of a novel, the railway carriage on the seat of which a traveller reads it in order to kill time. It was perhaps from an impression I received, also near Montjouvain, a few years later, an impression that remained obscure to me at the time, that there emerged, well after, the idea which I formed of sadism. As will be seen later, for quite other reasons the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had had to leave for the whole day, had told me to return home as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I liked to look at the reflections of the tile roof again, I had lain down in the shade and fallen asleep among the bushes of the hillock that overlooks the house, in the same spot where I had once waited for my father on a day when he had gone to see M. Vinteuil. It was almost night when I awoke, I wanted to stand up, but I saw Mlle Vinteuil (insofar as I actually recognized her, because I had not seen her very often in Combray, and only when she was still a child, whereas now she was growing into a young woman), who had probably just come home, opposite me, a few centimetres from me, in the room in which her father had entertained mine and which she had made into her own little drawing-room. The window was half open, the lamp was lit, I could see her every movement without her seeing me, but if I had gone away I would have made rustling sounds among the bushes, she would have heard me and she might have thought I had hidden there to spy on her. She was in deep mourning, because her father had died a short time before. We had not gone to see her, my mother had not wanted to because of a virtue of hers which alone limited the effects of her goodness: her sense of decency; but she pitied her deeply. My mother recalled the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, completely absorbed as it was first in giving his daughter the care of a mother or a nursemaid, then in the suffering his daughter had caused him; she could still see the tormented expression on the old man's face during that last period; she knew he had entirely given up completing the task of transcribing in clean copies all his work of the last few years, insignificant pieces by an old piano teacher, by a former village organist, which we could well imagine had scarcely any value in themselves, but which we did not disdain because they had so much value for him, having been his reason for living before he sacrificed them for his daughter, and which, for the most part not even written down, preserved only in his memory, a few jotted on scattered sheets of paper, unreadable, would remain unknown; my mother thought of that other, even crueller renunciation which had been forced upon M. Vinteuil, the renunciation of a future of decent and respectable happiness for his daughter; when she remembered all this extreme distress on the part of my aunts' old piano teacher, she was moved by real sorrow and thought with horror of the far more bitter sorrow that Mlle Vinteuil must be feeling, mingled as it was with remorse at having more or less killed her father. 'Poor M. Vinteuil, my mother would say, he lived and died for his daughter, without getting any reward for it. Will he get it after his death, and in what form? It could only come to him from her.' At the back of Mlle Vinteuil's drawing-room, on the mantelpiece, stood a small portrait of her father which she quickly went to get at the moment when the rattle of a carriage could be heard from the road outside, then she threw herself down",3.48068929002624,0.8853652795623546,0.4406868902535966,0.04585047998614934,4.270016565433462,4.0,2.3830991866840727,51.74285714285714,36.0,47.15163554632944,1.288790723357261,1.0,0.623469944564126,1811,618,0.3412479293208172,7938,35,63.48739588540195,3.734441868283361e+27,1.857007393477554e+24,0.8715057881439433,0.8552713087110808,45.28430480397576,19.797444821329965,13.302647169006491,23.148827009544846,24.55320659462017,8.73563776918829,68.805253608898,8.82857142857143,True,1171.0,0.9030333167578319,3.947289905519642,2011.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0030807147258163892,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010474430067775724,0.004929143561306223,0.0,0.011934361014420686,36,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"on a couch, drew a little table close to her and set the portrait on it, just as M. Vinteuil had once placed beside him the piece that he wanted to play for my parents. Soon her friend came in. Mlle Vinteuil greeted her without standing up, both hands behind her head, and moved to the end of the sofa as though to make room for her. But immediately she felt that by doing this she seemed to be forcing her friend into a position that might be annoying to her. She thought her friend might prefer to be some distance away from her on a chair, she thought she had been indiscreet, her tactful heart grew alarmed; moving so that she now occupied all the space on the sofa again she closed her eyes and began yawning to imply that she had only stretched out like that because she was sleepy. Despite the crude and overweening familiarity with which she treated her friend, I recognized her father's obsequious and reticent gestures, his sudden qualms. Soon she stood up and pretended to be trying to close the shutters without success. No, leave them open, I'm hot, said her friend. But it's a nuisance, someone will see us,' answered Mlle Vinteuil. But she must have guessed that her friend would think she had said these words only to goad her into answering with certain others that she in fact wanted to hear, but that out of discretion she wanted to leave her friend the initiative of uttering. And so her face, which I could not see, must have assumed the expression that my grandmother liked so much, as she quickly added: When I say see us, I mean see us reading; it's such a nuisance to think that whatever insignificant thing you may be doing, other eyes are watching you. Out of an instinctive generosity and an involuntary courtesy she did not speak the premeditated words that she had felt were indispensable to the full realization of her desire. And time and again, deep inside her, a timid and supplicant virgin entreated and forced back a rough and swaggering brawler. Yes, I'm sure people are watching us at this hour, in this densely populated countryside, her friend said ironically. And what if they are? she added (thinking she had to give a mischievous, tender wink as she uttered these words, which she recited good-naturedly like a text she knew Mlle Vinteuil liked, in a tone that she tried to make cynical), 'if someone saw us, so much the better. Mlle Vinteuil shuddered and stood up. Her scrupulous and sensitive heart did not know what words ought to come to her spontaneously to suit the scene that her senses demanded. She searched as far away from her true moral nature as she could to find a language that would fit the depraved girl she wanted to be, but the words she thought that girl would have uttered sincerely seemed false on her own lips. And the little she allowed herself to say was said in a stiff tone of voice in which her habitual shyness paralysed her inclinations towards boldness, and was interlarded with: 'You're not too cold, are you, you're not too warm, would you rather be alone and read?' Mademoiselle seems to have rather libidinous thoughts this evening, she said at last, probably repeating a phrase she had heard before on her friend's lips. Mlle Vinteuil felt her friend plant a kiss in the opening of her crepe blouse, she gave a little cry, broke free, and they began chasing each other, leaping, fluttering their wide sleeves like wings, and clucking and cheeping like two amorous birds. At last Mlle Vinteuil collapsed on the couch, with her friend's body covering her. But the friend had her back turned to the little table on which the old piano teacher's picture was placed. Mlle Vinteuil realized that her friend would not see it if her attention was not drawn to it, and she said to her, as if she had only just noticed it: That picture of my father is looking at us. I don't know who could have put it there. I've told them a dozen times that it doesn't belong there. I remembered that these were the same words M. Vinteuil had spoken to my father in connection with the piece of music. They were probably in the habit of using the portrait for ritual profanations, because her friend answered her in words which must have been part of her liturgical response: Oh, leave him where he is. He's not here to bother us anymore. Just think how he would start whining and try to make you put your coat on if he could see you there with the window open, the ugly old monkey. With words of gentle reproach Mlle Vinteuil answered: 'Come, come,' which proved the goodness of her nature, not because they were dictated by the indignation she might have felt at this way of referring to her father (evidently this was a feeling that she had grown used to silencing in herself at these times, with the help of who knows what sophistical reasonings), but because they were a sort of curb that she herself, so as not to seem selfish, was applying to the pleasure that her friend was trying to give her. And, too, such smiling forbearance in response to these blasphemies, such a tender, hypocritical reproach, may have appeared to her frank and generous good nature a particularly unspeakable form, a saccharine form of the wickedness she was trying to emulate. But she could not resist the attraction of the pleasure she would feel at being treated with such tenderness by a woman so implacable towards a defenceless dead man; she jumped on her friend's knees, and chastely presented her forehead for a kiss, as a daughter might have done, with the delightful sensation that the two of them were achieving an extreme of cruelty by robbing M. Vinteuil, even in his grave, of his fatherhood. Her friend took her head in her hands and set a kiss on her forehead with a docility that came easily to her because of her great affection for Mlle Vinteuil and her desire to bring some amusement into the orphan's life, which was now so sad. Do you know what I would like to do to him that old horror? she said, picking up the portrait. And she murmured in Mlle Vinteuil's ear something I could not hear. Oh, you wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare spit on him? On that old thing? said her friend with deliberate savagery. I did not hear any more, because Mlle Vinteuil, with a manner that was weary, awkward, fussy, honest, and sad, came and closed the shutters and the window, but now I knew that for all the suffering which M. Vinteuil had endured on his daughter's account during his lifetime, this was what he had received from her as his reward after his death. And yet I have thought, since then, that if M. Vinteuil had been able to witness this scene, he still might not have lost his faith in his daughter's good heart, and perhaps he would not even have been entirely wrong in that. It was true that in Mlle Vinteuil's habits, the appearance of evil was so complete that it would have been hard to find it so perfectly represented in anyone other than a sadist; it is behind the footlights of a popular theatre rather than in the lamplight of an actual country house that one expects to see a girl encouraging her friend to spit on the portrait of a father who lived only for her; and almost nothing else but sadism provides a basis in real life for the aesthetics of melodrama. In reality, even when she is not a sadist, a girl might perhaps have failings as cruel as those of Mlle Vinteuil with regard to the memory and wishes of her dead father, but she would not deliberately express them in an act of such rudimentary and naive symbolism; what was criminal about her behaviour would be more veiled from the eyes of others and even from her own, and she would do evil without admitting it to herself. But, beyond appearances, even in Mlle Vinteuil's heart, the evil, in the beginning at least, was probably not unmixed. A sadist of her sort is an artist of evil, something that an entirely bad creature could not be, for then evil would not be exterior to her, it would seem to her quite natural, would not even be distinguishable from her; and as for virtue, memory of the dead and filial tenderness, since she would not be devoutly attached to them she would take no sacrilegious pleasure in profaning them. Sadists of Mlle Vinteuil's sort are beings so purely sentimental, so naturally virtuous that even sensual pleasure seems to them something bad, the privilege of the wicked. And when they allow themselves to yield to it for a moment, they are trying to step into the skin of the wicked and to make their partner do so as well, so as to have the illusion, for a moment, of escaping from their scrupulous and tender soul into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I understood how much she longed for it when I saw how impossible it was for her to succeed in it. At the very moment when she wanted to be so different from her father, what she at once suggested to me were the old piano teacher's ways of thinking, of speaking. Far more than his photograph, what she really desecrated, what she was really using for her pleasures, though it remained between them and her and kept her from enjoying them directly, was the resemblance between her face and his, his own mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her like a family jewel, those kind gestures which interposed between Mlle Vinteuil's vice and herself a style of talking, a mentality that was not made for it and that prevented her from recognizing it as something very different from the numberless obligatory courtesies to which she usually devoted herself. It was not evil which gave her the idea of pleasure, which seemed agreeable to her; it was pleasure that seemed to her malign. And since each time she indulged in it, it was accompanied by these bad thoughts which were absent the rest of the time from her virtuous soul, she came to see pleasure as something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle Vinteuil felt that her friend was not fundamentally bad and was not really sincere when she talked to her in this",3.2489213116376985,1.1275796491495707,0.43193324411386463,0.06945671048951266,4.38457269700333,4.0,2.3465670394613256,32.17857142857143,24.5,23.38658585512609,1.2869034406215316,1.0,0.6341515000151887,1802,595,0.330188679245283,8158,56,59.24192022789981,5.351050533581666e+25,2.6424940906576127e+22,0.8017281499775973,0.7629237997311132,65.30171892341845,12.145103456476935,11.35114627814755,15.446345330585064,15.310623117171396,9.061420643729193,50.3805692088156,5.857142857142857,True,1145.0,0.9032098765432098,4.028641975308642,2025.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004619401486242217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018075918859208676,0.007531632858003615,0.0054227756577626025,0.011851851851851851,37,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"blasphemous way. At least she had the pleasure of kissing her friend's face with its smiles and glances that might have been feigned but were similar in their depraved and base expression to the smiles and glances of, not a kind, suffering person, but one given to cruelty and pleasure. She could imagine for a moment that she was really playing the games that would have been played, with so unnatural a confederate, by a girl who actually had these barbaric feelings towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought that evil was a state so rare, so extraordinary, so disorienting, and to which it was so restful to emigrate, if she had been able to discern in herself, as in everyone else, that indifference to the sufferings one causes which, whatever other names one gives it, is the terrible and lasting form assumed by cruelty. If it was fairly simple to go the Meseglise way, it was another matter to go the Guermantes way, because the walk was long and we wanted to be sure what sort of weather we would be having. When we seemed to be entering a succession of fine days; when Francoise, desperate because not a single drop of water had fallen on the 'poor crops', and seeing only rare white clouds swimming on the calm blue surface of the sky, exclaimed with a moan: 'Why, they look just like a lot of dog-fishes swimming about up yonder showing us their muzzles! Ah, they never think to make it rain a little for the poor farmers! And then as soon as the wheat is well up, that's when the rain will begin to fall pit-a-pat pit-a-pat without a break, and think no more of where it's falling than if 'twas falling on the sea'; when my father had been given the same unvarying favourable responses by both the gardener and the barometer, then we would say over dinner: 'Tomorrow, if the weather's the same, we'll go the Guermantes way.' We would leave right after lunch by the little garden gate and we would tumble out into the rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle and filled with different varieties of grasses among which two or three wasps would spend the day botanizing, a street as odd as its name, which it seemed to me was the source of its curious peculiarities and its cantankerous personality, a street one would seek in vain in Combray now, for on its old path the school now stands. But in my daydreams (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc,47 who, thinking they will find under a Renaissance rood screen or a seventeenth-century altar the traces of a Romanesque choir, restore the whole edifice to the state in which it must have been in the twelfth century) I do not leave one stone of the new structure standing, I break through it and 'reinstate' the rue des Perchamps. And for these reconstructions I also have more precise data than restorers generally have: a few pictures preserved by my memory, perhaps the last still in existence now, and destined soon to be obliterated, of what Combray was during the time of my childhood; and, because Combray itself drew them in me before disappearing, they are as moving if one may compare an obscure portrait to those glorious representations of which my grandmother liked to give me reproductions as those old engravings of the Last Supper or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, da Vinci's masterpiece and the portal of Saint Mark's.48 In the rue de l'Oiseau we would pass in front of the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesche, which in the seventeenth century had sometimes seen in its great courtyard the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes and de Montmorency when they had to come to Combray for some dispute with their tenants or to accept their homage. We would come to the mall, among whose trees the Saint-Hilaire steeple would appear. And I would have liked to be able to sit down and stay there the whole day reading while I listened to the bells; because it was so lovely and tranquil that, when the hour rang, you would have said not that it broke the calm of the day, but that it relieved the day of what it contained and that the steeple, with the indolent, painstaking precision of a person who has nothing else to do, had merely in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops slowly and naturally amassed there by the heat pressed at the proper moment the fullness of the silence. The greatest charm of the Guermantes way was that we had next to us, almost the whole time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, on a footbridge called the Pont-Vieux. The day after we arrived, following the sermon on Easter Sunday, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see, amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, when the sumptuous preparations make the household utensils that are still lying about appear more sordid than usual, the river already walking along dressed in sky blue between lands still black and bare, accompanied only by a flock of cuckooflowers that had arrived too early and of primroses ahead of their time, while here and there a violet with a blue beak bent its stalk under the weight of the drop of fragrance it held in its throat. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which at this spot would be draped, in the summer, with the blue foliage of a hazel tree, under which a fisherman in a straw hat had taken root. In Combray, where I always knew which particular farrier or grocer's boy was concealed within the uniform of the verger or the choirboy's surplice, this fisherman is the only person whose identity I never discovered. He must have known my parents, because he would raise his hat when we passed; I would then try to ask his name, but they would signal me to keep quiet so as not to frighten the fish. We would enter the tow-path, which overlooked the current from an embankment several feet high; on the other side the bank was low, extending in vast meadows to the village and train station far away. They were strewn with the remains, half buried in the grass, of the chateau of the old counts of Combray, who during the Middle Ages had had the stream of the Vivonne as defence on this side against the attacks of the lords of Guermantes and the abbots of Martinville. These remains were now no more than a few fragments of towers embossing the grassland, barely apparent, a few battlements from which in the old days the crossbowman would hurl stones, from which the watchman would keep an eye on Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-L'Exempt, all of them vassal lands of Guermantes among which Combray was enclosed, today level with the grass, gazed down upon by the children of the friars' school, who came here to learn their lessons or play at recreation time a past that had almost descended into the earth, lying by the edge of the water like some hiker enjoying the cool air, but giving me a great deal to think about, making me add to the little town of today, within the name of Combray, a very different city, captivating my thoughts with its incomprehensible face of long ago, which it half concealed under the buttercups. There were a great many of them in this spot, which they had chosen for their games on the grass, solitary, in couples, in groups, yellow as the yellow of an egg, shining all the more, it seemed to me, because, since I could not channel the pleasure which the sight of them gave me into any impulse to take a taste of them, I would let it accumulate in their golden surface, until it became potent enough to produce some useless beauty; and I did this starting from my earliest childhood, when I would stretch my arms out towards them from the tow-path though I could not yet correctly spell their pretty name,49 the name of some prince from a French fairy tale, whereas perhaps they had come from Asia many centuries ago, but were now naturalized for good in the village, content with the modest horizon, liking the sun and the water's edge, faithful to the little view of the station, but still retaining, like some of our old paintings in their folksy simplicity, a poetic lustre of the Orient. I liked to look at the bottles which the boys put in the Vivonne to catch little fish, and which were filled by the river that in turn surrounded them, so that they became at once a 'container' with transparent sides like hardened water and a 'content' immersed in a larger container of flowing liquid crystal, and evoked the image of freshness more deliciously and vexingly than they would have done on a table laid for dinner, by showing it only in perpetual flight between the water without consistency in which my hands could not capture it and the glass without fluidity in which my palate could not enjoy it. I promised myself I would return there later with some fishing lines; I persuaded them to take out a bit of bread from the provisions for our tea; I threw it into the Vivonne in pellets that seemed enough to provoke a phenomenon of supersaturation, for the water immediately solidified around them in ovoid clusters of starving tadpoles which until then it had no doubt been holding in solution, invisible, on the point of beginning to crystallize. Soon the course of the Vivonne is obstructed by water plants. First they appear singly, like this water-lily, for instance, which was allowed so little rest by the current in the midst of which it was unfortunately placed that, like a mechanically activated ferry-boat, it would approach one bank only to return to the one from which it had come, eternally crossing back and forth again. Pushed towards the bank, its peduncle would unfold, lengthen, flow out, reach the extreme limit of its tension at the edge where the current would pick it up again, then the green cord would fold up on itself and bring the poor plant back to what may all the more properly be called its point of departure because it did not stay there a second without starting off from it again in a repetition of the same manoeuvre. I would find it",3.754357543811376,1.3006592677931512,0.4358400715954685,0.06907322549138448,4.406164006604293,4.0,2.372360911056604,58.61290322580645,50.0,42.9430811726818,1.2839845899834892,1.0,0.636214014888046,1817,723,0.39790864061640063,8257,31,63.883868826583054,5.551517510744551e+27,2.728018432798305e+24,0.8551205376784007,0.8382660828787705,38.717806913203304,22.420050419869685,13.592691069251327,25.734649457631335,28.62948408400944,9.60323610346725,76.88477994567435,10.709677419354838,True,1092.0,0.8992628992628993,4.057493857493857,2035.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068608929104106596,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013125186437307349,0.005369394451625733,0.0,0.010810810810810811,38,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"again, walk after walk, always in the same situation, reminding me of certain neurasthenics among whose number my grandfather would count my Aunt Leonie, who present year after year the unchanging spectacle of the bizarre habits they believe, each time, they are about to shake off and which they retain for ever; caught in the machinery of their maladies and their manias, the efforts with which they struggle uselessly to abandon them only guarantee the functioning and activate the triggers of their strange, unavoidable and morose regimes. This water-lily was the same, and it was also like one of those miserable creatures whose singular torment, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have asked the tormented creature himself to recount its cause and its particularities at greater length had Virgil, striding on ahead, not forced him to hurry after immediately, as my parents did me. But farther on, the current slows down and crosses an estate opened to the public by its owner, who at this spot had made a hobby of creating works of aquatic horticulture, turning the little pools formed by the Vivonne into true flowering gardens of white water-lilies. Because the banks were heavily wooded here, the trees' great shadows gave the water a depth that was usually dark green although sometimes, when we came home on an evening that was calm again after a stormy afternoon, I saw that it was a light, raw blue verging on violet, cloisonne in appearance and Japanese in style. Here and there on the surface, the flower of a water-lily blushed like a strawberry, with a scarlet heart, white on its edges. Farther off, the more numerous flowers were paler, less smooth, coarser-grained, creased, and grouped by chance in coils so graceful that one thought one saw, floating adrift as after the melancholy dismantling of some gay party, loosened garlands of moss-roses. In another place one corner seemed reserved for the various common species, of a tidy white or pink like dame's-rocket, washed clean like porcelain with housewifely care, while a little farther off, others, pressed against one another in a true floating flower border, suggested garden pansies that had come like butterflies to rest their glossy blue-tinged wings on the transparent obliquity of that watery bed; of that celestial bed as well: for it gave the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more affecting than the colour of the flowers themselves; and, whether it sparkled beneath the water-lilies in the afternoon in a kaleidoscope of silent, watchful and mobile contentment, or whether towards evening it filled, like some distant port, with the rose and reverie of the sunset, ceaselessly changing so as to remain in harmony, around the more fixed colours of the corollas themselves, with all that is most profound, most fleeting, most mysterious all that is infinite in the hour, it seemed to have made them flower in the middle of the sky itself. As it left this park, the Vivonne flowed freely again. How often did I see, and want to imitate, as soon as I should be at liberty to live as I chose, a rower who, having let go of his oars, had lain flat on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, and allowing it to drift, seeing only the sky gliding slowly above him, bore on his face a foretaste of happiness and peace! We would sit down among the irises at the edge of the water. In the holiday sky lingered an idle cloud. Now and then, oppressed by boredom, a carp would rise up from the water with an anxious gasp. It was time for tea. Before starting off again we would remain there on the grass for a long time eating fruit, bread and chocolate, and we would hear, coming all the way to us, horizontal, weakened, but still dense and metallic, the peals of the Saint-Hilaire bell which had not melted into the air they had been traversing for so long and which, ribbed by the successive palpitation of all their waves of sound, vibrated as they brushed over the flowers, at our feet. Sometimes, at the edge of the water and surrounded by woods, we would come upon what is called a 'holiday house',50 isolated and secluded, seeing nothing of the world but the river that bathed its feet. A young woman whose pensive face and elegant veils did not belong to this region and who had probably come to 'bury herself' here, as the expression has it, to taste the bitter sweetness of knowing that her name, and more importantly the name of the man whose heart she had not been able to hold on to, were unknown here, stood framed in a window that did not allow her to look farther than the boat moored near the door. She would absently lift her eyes as she heard, behind the trees along the riverbank, the voices of people passing of whom, even before she glimpsed their faces, she could be certain that they had never known the faithless one nor ever would know him, that nothing in their past bore his imprint, that nothing in their future would have occasion to receive it. One sensed that, in her renunciation, she had deliberately withdrawn from places where she might at least have glimpsed the man she loved, in favour of these places which had never seen him. And I watched her, as she came back from some walk on a path along which she knew he would not pass, drawing from her resigned hands long gloves of a useless grace. Never, in our walk along the Guermantes way, could we go as far as the sources of the Vivonne, of which I had often thought and which had in my mind an existence so abstract, so ideal, that I had been as surprised when I was told they could be found within the departement, at a certain distance in kilometres from Combray, as I was the day I learned there was another precise spot on the earth where the opening lay, in ancient times, of the entrance to the Underworld. Never, either, could we go all the way to the end-point that I would so much have liked to reach, all the way to Guermantes. I knew this was where the castellans, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, lived, I knew they were real and presently existing figures, but when I thought about them, I pictured them to myself sometimes made of tapestry, like the Comtesse de Guermantes in our church's Coronation of Esther, sometimes in changing colours, like Gilbert the Bad in the stained-glass window where he turned from cabbage green to plum blue, depending on whether I was still in front of the holy water or was reaching our seats, sometimes completely impalpable like the image of Genevieve de Brabant, ancestor of the Guermantes family, which our magic lantern walked out over the curtains of my room or up to the ceiling but always wrapped in the mystery of Merovingian times and bathing as though in a sunset in the orange light emanating from that syllable: 'antes'. But if despite this they were, as duke and duchess, real human beings for me, even if strange ones, on the other hand their ducal person was inordinately distended, became immaterial, in order to contain within itself this Guermantes of which they were duke and duchess, all this sunlit 'Guermantes way', the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its tall trees, and so many lovely afternoons. And I knew that they did not merely bear the title of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century when, after uselessly trying to defeat its former lords, they had formed an alliance with them through marriages, they were also Comtes de Combray, and thus the foremost citizens of Combray, and yet the only ones who did not live there. Comtes de Combray, possessing Combray in the midst of their name, of their person, and no doubt actually having within them that strange and pious sadness that was special to Combray; proprietors in the town, but not of a private house, probably dwelling outdoors, in the street, between sky and earth, like Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the windows of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the reverse side, of black lake, if I raised my head as I went to get salt at Camus's. And along the Guermantes way I would sometimes pass damp little enclosures over which climbed clusters of dark flowers. I would stop, thinking I was about to acquire some precious idea, because it seemed to me that there before my eyes I possessed a fragment of that fluvial region I had so much wanted to know ever since I had seen it described by one of my favourite writers. And it was with this, with its imaginary ground traversed by currents of seething water, that Guermantes, changing its appearance in my mind, was identified when I heard Doctor Percepied talk to us about the flowers and beautiful spring waters that could be seen in the park of their country house. I dreamed that Mme de Guermantes had summoned me there, smitten with a sudden fancy for me; all day long she would fish for trout with me. And in the evening, holding me by the hand as we walked past the little gardens of her vassals, she would show me the flowers that leaned their violet and red stems along the low walls, and would teach me their names. She would make me tell her the subjects of the poems that I intended to compose. And these dreams warned me that since I wanted to be a writer some day, it was time to find out what I meant to write. But as soon as I asked myself this, trying to find a subject in which I could anchor some infinite philosophical meaning, my mind would stop functioning, I could no longer see anything but empty space before my attentive eyes, I felt that I had no talent or perhaps a disease of the brain kept it from being born. Sometimes I counted on my father to make it all come out right. He was so powerful, in such favour with people in office, that he had succeeded in having us transgress the laws that Francoise had taught me to consider more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, to procure for our house alone, in the whole neighbourhood, a year's postponement of the work of 'replastering', to obtain permission from the minister for Mme Sazerat's son, who wanted to go to take the waters, to pass his baccalaueat",3.7993708306000413,1.226732082890751,0.43611265909511204,0.06468891948764474,4.450331125827814,4.0,2.3294507829010542,51.77142857142857,48.0,37.2766381947466,1.280905077262693,1.0,0.5970953032340811,1812,722,0.3984547461368653,8320,35,65.73323475045913,3.528426943753443e+28,1.7203446824736436e+25,0.8539665534215815,0.846966008345286,45.92243046357618,19.715537054556922,12.590306688366976,22.827776726584673,25.416773888363288,9.796203090507724,71.1422894985809,10.028571428571428,True,1059.0,0.886396879570941,4.056557776694295,2051.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01541501976284585,0.010869565217391304,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011264822134387351,0.0031620553359683794,0.004150197628458498,0.006338371526084837,39,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"not contain, she did not want that wave to disturb the common people, to appear to disdain the common people whom it encountered again and again in passing. I can still see, above her silky, swelling mauve tie, the gentle surprise in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to intend it for anyone but so that all might take their share of it, the slightly shy smile of a sovereign who looks as though she is apologizing to her vassals and loves them. That smile fell on me, who had not taken my eyes off her. Recalling, then, the gaze she had rested on me during the Mass, as blue as a ray of sunlight passing through Gilbert the Bad's window, I said to myself: 'Why, she's actually paying attention to me.' I believed that she liked me, that she would still be thinking of me after she had left the church, that because of me perhaps she would be sad that evening at Guermantes. And immediately I loved her, because if it may sometimes be enough for us to fall in love with a woman if she looks at us with contempt, as I had thought Mlle Swann had done, and if we think she will never belong to us, sometimes, too, it may be enough if she looks at us with kindness, as Mme de Guermantes was doing, and if we think she may some day belong to us. Her eyes turned as blue as a periwinkle which was impossible to pick, yet which she had dedicated to me; and the sun, threatened by a cloud but still beating down with all its strength on the square and in the sacristy, gave a geranium flesh-tint to the red carpets that had been laid on the ground for the solemnities and over which Mme de Guermantes advanced smiling, and added to their woolly weave a rosy velvet, an epidermis of light, the sort of tenderness, the sort of grave sweetness amid pomp and joy that characterize certain pages of Lohengrin,51 certain paintings by Carpaccio,52 and that explain why Baudelaire53 was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet delicious. How much more distressing still, after that day, during my walks along the Guermantes way, did it seem to me than it had seemed before to have no aptitude for literature, and to have to give up all hope of ever being a famous writer! The sorrow I felt over this, as I daydreamed alone, a little apart from the others, made me suffer so much that in order not to feel it any more, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the face of pain, would stop thinking altogether about poems, novels, a poetic future on which my lack of talent forbade me to depend. Then, quite apart from all these literary preoccupations and not connected to them in any way, suddenly a roof, a glimmer of sun on a stone, the smell of the road would stop me because of a particular pleasure they gave me, and also because they seemed to be concealing, beyond what I could see, something which they were inviting me to come and take and which despite my efforts I could not manage to discover. Since I felt that it could be found within them, I would stay there, motionless, looking, breathing, trying to go with my thoughts beyond the image or the smell. And if I had to catch up with my grandfather, continue on my way, I would try to find them again by closing my eyes; I would concentrate on recalling precisely the line of the roof, the shade of the stone which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me so full, so ready to open, to yield me the thing for which they themselves were merely a cover. Of course it was not impressions of this kind that could give me back the hope I had lost, of succeeding in becoming a writer and a poet some day, because they were always tied to a particular object with no intellectual value and no reference to any abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity, and so distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt each time I looked for a philosophical subject for a great literary work. But the moral duty imposed on me by the impressions I received from form, fragrance or colour was so arduous to try to perceive what was concealed behind them that I would soon look for excuses that would allow me to save myself from this effort and spare myself this fatigue. Fortunately, my parents would call me, I would feel I did not have the tranquillity I needed at the moment for pursuing my search in a useful way, and that it would be better not to think about it any more until I was back at home, and not to fatigue myself beforehand to no purpose. And so I would stop concerning myself with this unknown thing that was enveloped in a form or a fragrance, feeling quite easy in my mind since I was bringing it back to the house protected by the covering of images under which I would find it alive, like the fish that, on days when I had been allowed to go fishing, I would carry home in my creel covered by a layer of grass that kept them fresh. Once I was back at the house I would think about other things, and so there would accumulate in my mind (as in my room the flowers I had gathered on my walks or objects I had been given) a stone on which a glimmer of light played, a roof, the sound of a bell, a smell of leaves, many different images beneath which the reality I sensed but did not have enough determination to discover had died long before. Once, however when our walk had extended far beyond its usual duration and we were very happy to encounter half-way home, as the afternoon was ending, Doctor Percepied, who, going past at full speed in his carriage, recognized us and invited us to climb in with him I had an impression of this kind and did not abandon it without studying it a little. They had had me climb up next to the coachman, we were going like the wind because, before returning to Combray, the doctor still had to stop at Martinville-le-Sec to see a patient at whose door it had been agreed that we would wait for him. At the bend of a road I suddenly experienced that special pleasure which was unlike any other, when I saw the two steeples of Martinville, shining in the setting sun and appearing to change position with the motion of our carriage and the windings of the road, and then the steeple of Vieuxvicq, which, though separated from them by a hill and a valley and situated on a higher plateau in the distance, seemed to be right next to them. As I observed, as I noted the shape of their spires, the shifting of their lines, the sunlight on their surfaces, I felt that I was not reaching the full depth of my impression, that something was behind that motion, that brightness, something which they seemed at once to contain and conceal. The steeples appeared so distant, and we seemed to approach them so slowly, that I was surprised when we stopped a few moments later in front of the Martinville church. I did not know why I had taken such pleasure in the sight of them on the horizon and the obligation to try to discover the reason seemed to me quite painful; I wanted to hold in reserve in my head those lines moving in the sun, and not think about them any more now. And it is quite likely that had I done so, the two steeples would have gone for ever to join the many trees, rooftops, fragrances, sounds, that I had distinguished from others because of the obscure pleasure they gave me which I never thoroughly studied. I got down to talk to my parents while we waited for the doctor. Then we set off again, I was back in my place on the seat, I turned my head to see the steeples again, a little later glimpsing them one last time at a bend in the road. Since the coachman, who did not seem inclined to talk, had hardly answered anything I said, I was obliged, for lack of other company, to fall back on my own and try to recall my steeples. Soon their lines and their sunlit surfaces split apart, as if they were a sort of bark, a little of what was hidden from me inside them appeared to me, I had a thought which had not existed a moment before, which took shape in words in my head, and the pleasure I had just recently experienced at the sight of them was so increased by this that, seized by a sort of drunkenness, I could no longer think of anything else. At that moment, as we were already far away from Martinville, turning my head I caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had already set. At moments the bends of the road would hide them from me, then they showed themselves one last time, and finally I did not see them again. Without saying to myself that what was hidden behind the steeples of Martinville had to be something analogous to a pretty sentence, since it had appeared to me in the form of words that gave me pleasure, I asked the doctor for a pencil and some paper and I composed, despite the jolts of the carriage, and in order to ease my conscience and yield to my enthusiasm, the following little piece that I have since found again and that I have not had to submit to more than a few changes: 'Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and appearing lost in the open country, the two steeples of Martinville ascended towards the sky. Soon we saw three: wheeling around boldly to position itself opposite them, the laggard steeple of Vieuxvicq had come along to join them. The minutes were passing, we were going fast, and yet the three steeples were still far away ahead of us, like three birds poised on the plain, motionless, distinguishable in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq moved away, receded into the distance, and the steeples of",3.8343023810820838,0.9046855673952857,0.45211108303768965,0.03916189819191033,4.18005540166205,4.0,2.3368044087120525,51.57142857142857,48.0,26.088076876267458,1.257617728531856,1.0,0.5904164248219638,1805,600,0.33240997229916897,7746,35,67.51161844707683,2.0889274454332312e+29,1.0423789647870416e+26,0.8978766711319194,0.8870707569700299,48.095540166205,19.362746339533043,12.340626583579944,22.64519192718639,24.04377522754254,8.204764542936285,67.47170557973882,8.2,True,1167.0,0.9016966067864272,3.8652694610778444,2004.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01571338780641106,0.009218520846427823,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009428032683846637,0.003771213073538655,0.0,0.003992015968063872,41,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"two months ahead of time, in the series of candidates whose names began with A, instead of waiting for the turn of the Ss. If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been captured by bandits, convinced that my father was in too close communication with the supreme powers, had letters of recommendation to the Good Lord too irresistible for my illness or captivity to be anything but empty simulacra that posed no danger to me, I would have waited calmly for the inevitable hour of my return to the correct reality, the hour of my rescue or recovery; perhaps my lack of talent, the black hole that opened in my mind when I looked for the subject of my future writings, was also merely an illusion without substance, and this illusion would cease through the intervention of my father, who must have agreed with the government and Providence that I would be the foremost writer of the day. But at other times, as my parents grew impatient at the sight of me lingering behind and not following them, my present life, instead of seeming to me an artificial creation of my father's that he could modify as he liked, appeared to me on the contrary to be included in a reality that had not been made for me, against which there was no recourse, within which I had no ally, which concealed nothing beyond itself. At those times it seemed to me that I existed the same way other men did, that I would grow old, that I would die like them, and that among them I was simply one of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, discouraged, I would give up literature for ever, despite the encouragement I had been given by Bloch. This intimate, immediate awareness I had of the worthlessness of my ideas prevailed against all the praise that might be heaped on me, as do, in a wicked man whose good deeds are universally commended, the qualms of his conscience. One day my mother said to me: 'You're always talking about Mme de Guermantes. Well, because Doctor Percepied took such good care of her four years ago she's coming to Combray to attend his daughter's wedding. You'll be able to see her at the ceremony.' It was from Doctor Percepied, in fact, that I had heard the most talk about Mme de Guermantes, and he had even shown us an issue of an illustrated magazine in which she was depicted in the costume she wore to a fancy-dress ball at the home of the Princesse de Leon. Suddenly during the wedding service, a movement made by the verger as he shifted his position allowed me to see, sitting in a chapel, a blonde lady with a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a full tie of smooth, shiny, new mauve silk, and a little pimple at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she were very warm, I could distinguish bits of resemblance, diluted and barely perceptible, to the picture I had been shown, especially because the particular features that I observed in her, if I tried to enunciate them, were formulated in exactly the same words a large nose, blue eyes which Doctor Percepied had used when he described the Duchesse de Guermantes in my presence, I said to myself: 'That lady looks like Mme de Guermantes'; now the chapel where she was attending Mass was that of Gilbert the Bad, under the flat tombstones of which, golden and distended like cells of honey, rested the former counts of Brabant, and which, I recalled, was reserved, according to what I had been told, for the Guermantes family when any one of its members came to Combray for a ceremony; there probably could not be more than one woman who resembled Mme de Guermantes's picture, who on that day, the very day when she was in fact supposed to come, was in that chapel: it was she! I was very disappointed. My disappointment came from the fact that I had never noticed, when I thought of Mme de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a stained-glass window, in another century, of a material different from that of other living people. I had never realized that she might have a red face, a mauve tie like Mme Sazerat, and the oval of her cheeks reminded me so much of people I had seen at our house that the suspicion touched me, dissipating immediately, however, that this lady, in her generative principle, in all her molecules, was perhaps not essentially the Duchesse de Guermantes, that instead, her body, unaware of the name applied to it, belonged to a certain female type that also included the wives of doctors and shopkeepers. 'So that's Mme de Guermantes that's what it is, that's all it is!' said the attentive and astonished expression with which I contemplated an image of course quite unrelated to those which under the same name of Mme de Guermantes had appeared so many times in my daydreams, since this one, this particular one, had not like the others been arbitrarily created by me, but had leaped to my eyes for the first time just a moment before, in the church; an image which was not of the same kind, was not colourable at will like those which had so readily absorbed the orange tint of a syllable, but was so real that everything, even the little pimple flaring up at the corner of her nose, attested to its subjection to the laws of life, just as, in a transformation scene in a theatre, a fold of the fairy's dress, a trembling of her little finger, betray the physical presence of a living actress, whereas we had not been sure if we were not looking at a simple projection of light. But at the same time, I was trying to apply to this image, which the prominent nose, the piercing eyes pinned into my vision (perhaps because it was they that had first reached it, that had made the first notch in it, at a moment when I had not yet had time to imagine that the woman who appeared before me could be Mme de Guermantes), to this entirely recent, unchangeable image, the idea: 'It's Mme de Guermantes,' without managing to do more than manoeuvre it in front of the image, like two disks separated by a gap. But this Mme de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed, now that I could see that she actually existed outside of me, acquired from this an even greater power over my imagination, which, paralysed for a moment by this contact with a reality so different from what it had expected, began to react and say to me: 'Glorious since before Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes is a descendant of Genevieve de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people here.' And oh, the marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the face by a cord so lax, so long, so extensible that it can travel out alone far away from it while Mme de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead, her gaze strolled here and there, climbed up the pillars, paused even on me like a ray of sunlight wandering through the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment I received its caress, seemed to me conscious. As for Mme de Guermantes herself, since she remained motionless, sitting there like a mother who does not appear to see the bold pranks and indiscreet enterprises of her children, who play and call out to people she does not know, it was impossible for me to tell if she approved or disapproved, in the idleness of her soul, of the vagabondage of her gaze. I felt it was important that she not leave before I had looked at her enough, because I remembered that for years now I had considered the sight of her eminently desirable, and I did not detach my eyes from her, as if each gaze could physically carry away, and put in reserve inside me, the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks, all the particular details that seemed to me so many precious, authentic and singular pieces of information about her face. Now that I was impelled to consider it beautiful by all the thoughts I had brought to bear on it and perhaps most of all by what is a kind of instinct to preserve the best parts of ourselves, by the desire we always have not to be disappointed placing her once again (since she and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom I had evoked until then were a single person) above the rest of humanity among whom the pure and simple sight of her body had for a moment made me confound her, I was irritated to hear people around me say: 'She's better-looking than Mme Sazerat, she's better-looking than Mlle Vinteuil,' as if she were comparable to them. And as my gaze stopped at her blonde hair, her blue eyes, the fastening of her collar, and omitted the features that might have reminded me of other faces, I exclaimed in front of this sketch, deliberately incomplete: 'How beautiful she is! How noble! What I see before me is indeed a proud Guermantes and a descendant of Genevieve de Brabant!' And the attention with which I illuminated her face isolated her to such an extent that today, if I think back to that ceremony, it is impossible for me to see a single one of the people who were present except for her and the verger who responded affirmatively when I asked him if that lady was really Mme de Guermantes. But I can still see her, especially at the moment when the procession entered the sacristy, which was lit by the hot and intermittent sun of a day of wind and storm, and in which Mme de Guermantes found herself surrounded by all those people of Combray whose names she did not even know, but whose inferiority too loudly proclaimed her supremacy for her not to feel a sincere benevolence towards them, and whom, besides, she hoped to impress even more by her good grace and simplicity. Thus, not being able to bestow those deliberate gazes charged with specific meaning which we address to someone we know, but only to allow her distracted thoughts to break free incessantly before her in a wave of blue light which she could",3.881176368703881,1.3841071947643728,0.4483749741758098,0.0687154831998537,4.321883656509695,4.0,2.496755301096927,62.241379310344826,53.0,47.846489564175386,1.3069252077562328,1.0,0.6522764037365557,1805,641,0.35512465373961216,8047,29,64.71560808561071,1.2753561612741495e+28,6.26402829702431e+24,0.8095638033534799,0.7970473904300619,33.09412742382274,24.10585538255803,14.652667245821299,27.511510172891395,30.046761677333073,9.137108033240992,81.1333460693476,11.758620689655173,True,1129.0,0.8929273084479371,3.9523575638506876,2036.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016857926271961005,0.012389560272164112,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023763582817101656,0.024169797907992282,0.005483903727023459,0.0054027504911591355,40,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"sometimes, at night in my dreams, clasps me with an almost uncanny power and which I can no longer recover when I wake up. No doubt, by virtue of having forever indissolubly united in me different impressions merely because they had made me experience them at the same time, the Meseglise way and the Guermantes way exposed me, for the future, to many disappointments and even to many mistakes. For often I have wanted to see a person again without discerning that it was simply because she reminded me of a hedge of hawthorns, and I have been induced to believe, to make someone else believe, in a revival of affection, by what was simply a desire to travel. But because of that very fact, too, and by persisting in those of my impressions of today to which they may be connected, they give them foundations, depth, a dimension lacking from the others. They add to them, too, a charm, a meaning that is for me alone. When on summer evenings the melodious sky growls like a wild animal and everyone grumbles at the storm, it is because of the Meseglise way that I am the only one in ecstasy inhaling, through the noise of the falling rain, the smell of invisible, enduring lilacs. Thus I would often lie until morning thinking back to the time at Combray, to my sad sleepless evenings, to the many days, too, whose image had been restored to me more recently by the taste what they would have called at Combray the 'perfume' of a cup of tea, and, by an association of memories, to what, many years after leaving that little town, I had learned, about a love affair Swann had had before I was born, with that precision of detail which is sometimes easier to obtain for the lives of people who died centuries ago than for the lives of our best friends, and which seems as impossible as it once seemed impossible to speak from one town to another as long as we do not know about the expedient by which that impossibility was circumvented. All these memories added to one another now formed a single mass, but one could still distinguish between them between the oldest, and those that were more recent, born of a perfume, and then those that were only memories belonging to another person from whom I had learned them if not fissures, if not true faults, at least that veining, that variegation of colouring, which in certain rocks, in certain marbles, reveal differences in origin, in age, in 'formation'. Of course by the time morning approached, the brief uncertainty of my waking would long since have dissipated. I knew which room I was actually in, I had reconstructed it around me in the darkness and either by orienting myself with memory alone, or by making use, as a clue, of a faint glimmer that I perceived, under which I placed the casement curtains I had reconstructed it entirely and furnished it like an architect and a decorator who retain the original openings of the windows and doors, I had put back the mirrors and restored the chest of drawers to its usual place. But scarcely had the daylight and no longer the reflection of a last ember on the brass curtain-rod which I had mistaken for it traced on the darkness, as though in chalk, its first white, correcting ray, than the window along with its curtains would leave the doorframe in which I had mistakenly placed it, while, to make room for it, the desk which my memory had clumsily moved there would fly off at top speed, pushing the fireplace before it and thrusting aside the wall of the passageway; a small courtyard would extend in the spot where only a moment before the dressing-room had been, and the dwelling I had rebuilt in the darkness would have gone off to join the dwellings glimpsed in the maelstrom of my awakening, put to flight by the pale sign traced above the curtains by the raised finger of the dawn. PART II: A Love of Swann's To belong to the 'little set', the 'little circle', the 'little clan' attached to the Verdurins, one condition was sufficient but necessary: you had to abide tacitly by a Credo one of whose articles was that the young pianist patronized by Mme Verdurin that year, of whom she would say: 'It ought to be against the law to be able to play Wagner like that!', 'was miles above' both Plante1 and Rubinstein2 and that Doctor Cottard was a better diagnostician than Potain.3 Any 'new recruit' who could not be persuaded by the Verdurins that the soirees given by people who did not come to the Verdurins' house were as tedious as a rainy day was immediately excluded. Because the women were more rebellious in this respect than the men when it came to setting aside their curiosity about society, their desire to find out for themselves how amusing the other salons might be, and because the Verdurins felt that this spirit of investigation and this demon of frivolity could in fact be fatally contagious to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been led to expel one after another all the 'faithful' of the female sex. Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that year (even though Mme Verdurin herself was virtuous and from a respectable bourgeois family, an extremely rich and entirely obscure one with which she had by degrees and of her own accord ceased to have any contact) to a person almost of the demi-monde, Mme de Crecy, whom Mme Verdurin called by her first name, Odette, and declared to be 'a love', and to the pianist's aunt, who must once have been employed as a caretaker; both of them being women ignorant of the world whom, in their naivety, it had been so easy to delude into believing that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay certain poor wretches in order to have any guests at their dinners, that if you had offered to get them invitations to the homes of these two great ladies, the former concierge and the cocotte would disdainfully have refused. The Verdurins did not invite you to dinner: you had, at their house, a 'place set for you'. For the soiree there was no programme. The young pianist would play, but only if 'he fancied', because they did not force anyone and, as M. Verdurin said: 'Anything for our friends, long live our pals!' If the pianist wanted to play the ride from The Valkyrie or the prelude from Tristan,4 Mme Verdurin would protest, not because she did not like that music, but on the contrary because it made too strong an impression on her. 'So you want me to have one of my migraines? You know perfectly well the same thing happens every time he plays that. I can count on it! Tomorrow when I try to get up that's it, not possible!' If he did not play, people would chat, and one of the friends, most often their favourite painter at the time, would 'spin', as M. Verdurin said, 'a damn funny tale that would make 'em all shriek with laughter', especially Mme Verdurin, for such was her habit of taking literally the figurative expressions for the emotions she was feeling that Doctor Cottard (a young novice at the time) would one day have to set her jaw after she dislocated it from laughing too much. Evening clothes were forbidden because one was 'among friends' and also so as not to look like the 'bores' whom they avoided like the plague and invited only to the larger soirees, given as rarely as possible and only if it might amuse the painter or help to promote the musician. The rest of the time, they were content to play charades, have supper in fancy dress, but only among themselves, not mixing any strangers in with the little 'clan'. But as the 'pals' had assumed more of a place in Mme Verdurin's life, the 'bores', the 'pariahs' were anything that kept the friends away from her, anything that now and then kept them from being free, whether it was the mother of one, the profession of another, the country house or the bad health of a third. If Doctor Cottard thought he ought to leave just after he got up from the table in order to return to a patient who was dangerously ill, 'Who knows, Mme Verdurin would say to him, he might be better off if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; without you, he'll have a good night; tomorrow morning early you'll go there and find him quite recovered.' At the beginning of December, she would be sick at the thought that the faithful would 'let them down' on Christmas Day and the 1st of January. The pianist's aunt insisted that he come to dinner with the family that day at her mother's home: You seem to think your mother might die, Mme Verdurin exclaimed harshly, if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day the way they do in the provinces! Her worries revived during Holy Week: Doctor, since you're such a scholar and free-thinker, may I assume you will be coming on Good Friday just as you would on any other day? she said confidently to Cottard the first year, as if she was sure what the answer would be. But she trembled as she waited for him to utter it, because if he did not come, she might find herself alone. I will come on Good Friday... to say good-bye to you, because we're going to be spending the Easter holiday in Auvergne. In Auvergne? You'll be eaten alive by fleas and other such vermin! Much good may it do you! And after a silence: If only you had told us, we would have tried to organize something; we could have made the trip together in comfort. Likewise, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend or if one of the ladies had a beau who might make them 'desert' occasionally, the Verdurins, who were not afraid of a woman having a lover provided she had him at their house, loved him in their midst and did not prefer his company to theirs, would say: 'Well, bring your friend along!' And they would engage him on trial, to see if he was capable of having no secrets from Mme Verdurin, if he was worthy of being enrolled in the 'little clan'.

"Martinville remained alone, illuminated by the light of the setting sun, which even at that distance I saw playing and smiling on their sloping sides. We had taken so long approaching them that I was thinking about the time we would still need in order to reach them, when suddenly the carriage turned and set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so roughly in front of us that we had only just time to stop in order not to run into the porch. We continued on our way; we had already left Martinville a little while before, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch us flee, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq were still waving good-bye with their sunlit tops. At times one of them would draw aside so that the other two could glimpse us again for an instant; but the road changed direction, they swung round in the light like three golden pivots and disappeared from my gaze. But a little later, when we were already close to Combray, and the sun had set, I caught sight of them one last time from very far away, seeming now no more than three flowers painted on the sky above the low line of the fields. They reminded me, too, of the three young girls in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place where darkness was already falling; and while we moved off at a gallop, I saw them timidly seek their way and, after some awkward stumbling of their noble silhouettes, press against one another, slip behind one another, now forming, against the still pink sky, no more than a single black shape, charming and resigned, and fade away into the night.' I never thought of this page again, but at that moment, when in the corner of the seat where the doctor's coachman usually placed in a basket the poultry he had bought at the market in Martinville, I had finished writing it, I was so happy, I felt it had so perfectly relieved me of those steeples and what they had been hiding behind them, that, as if I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice. All day long, during those walks, I had been able to dream about what a pleasure it would be to be a friend of the Duchesse de Guermantes, to fish for trout, to go out in a boat on the Vivonne, and, greedy for happiness, ask no more from life in those moments than for it always to be made up of a succession of happy afternoons. But when on the way back I saw on the left a farm which was fairly distant from two others very close to each other, and from which, in order to enter Combray, one had only to go down an avenue of oaks bordered on one side by meadows, each of which was part of a little enclosure and was planted at equal intervals with apple trees that wore, when they were lit by the setting sun, the Japanese design of their shadows, my heart would abruptly begin to beat faster, I would know that within half an hour we would be home and that, as was the rule on the days when we had gone the Guermantes way and dinner was served later, they would send me to bed as soon as I had had my soup, so that my mother, kept at table as though there were company for dinner, would not come up to say goodnight to me in my bed. The region of sadness I had just entered was as distinct from the region into which I had hurled myself with such joy only a moment before, as in certain skies a band of pink is separated as though by a line from a band of green or a band of black. One sees a bird fly into the pink, it is about to reach the end of it, it is nearly touching the black, then it has entered it. The desires that had surrounded me a short time ago, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to be happy, were so far behind me now that their fulfilment would not have brought me any pleasure. How I would have given all that up in order to be able to cry all night in Mama's arms! I was trembling, I did not take my anguished eyes off my mother's face, which would not be appearing that evening in the room where I could already see myself in my thoughts, I wanted to die. And that state of mind would continue until the following day, when the morning rays, like the gardener, would lean their bars against the wall clothed in nasturtiums that climbed up to my window, and I would jump out of bed to hurry down into the garden, without remembering, now, that evening would ever bring back with it the hour for leaving my mother. And so it was from the Guermantes way that I learned to distinguish those states of mind that follow one another in me, during certain periods, and that even go so far as to share out each day among them, one returning to drive out the other, with the punctuality of a fever; contiguous, but so exterior to one another, so lacking in means of communication among them, that I can no longer comprehend, no longer even picture to myself in one, what I desired, or feared, or accomplished in the other. And so the Meseglise way and the Guermantes way remain for me linked to many of the little events of that life which, of all the various lives we lead concurrently, is the most abundant in sudden reversals of fortune, the richest in episodes, I mean our intellectual life. No doubt it progresses within us imperceptibly, and the truths that have changed its meaning and its appearance for us, that have opened new paths to us, we had been preparing to discover for a long time; but we did so without knowing it; and for us they date only from the day, from the minute in which they became visible. The flowers that played on the grass then, the water that flowed past in the sunlight, the whole landscape that surrounded their appearance continues to accompany the memory of them with its unconscious or abstracted face; and certainly when they were slowly studied by that humble passer-by, that child dreaming as a king is studied by a memorialist lost in the crowd that corner of nature, that bit of garden could not have believed it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the fragrance of hawthorn that forages along the hedge where the wild roses will soon replace it, a sound of echoless steps on the gravel of an alley, a bubble formed against a water-plant by the current of the stream and bursting immediately my exaltation has borne them along with it and managed to carry them across so many years in succession, while the paths round about have disappeared and those who walked on them, and the memory of those who walked on them, have died. At times the piece of landscape thus transported into the present detaches itself in such isolation from everything else that it floats uncertain in my mind like a flowery Delos,54 while I cannot say from which country, which time perhaps quite simply which dream it comes. But it is most especially as deep layers of my mental soil, as the firm ground on which I still stand, that I must think of the Meseglise way and the Guermantes way. It is because I believed in things and in people while I walked along them, that the things and the people they revealed to me are the only ones I still take seriously today and that still bring me joy. Whether it is because the faith which creates has dried up in me, or because reality takes shape only in memory, the flowers I am shown today for the first time do not seem to me to be real flowers. The Meseglise way with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple trees, the Guermantes way with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies and buttercups, formed for me for all time the contours of the countrysides where I would like to live, where I demand above all else that I may go fishing, drift about in a boat, see ruins of Gothic fortifications and find among the wheatfields a church, like Saint-Andre-des-Champs, monumental, rustic and golden as a haystack; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple trees that I still happen, when travelling, to come upon in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on the level of my past, communicate immediately with my heart. And yet, because places have something individual about them, when I am seized by the desire to see the Guermantes way again, you would not satisfy it by taking me to the bank of a river where the water-lilies were just as beautiful, more beautiful than in the Vivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which later emigrates into love, and may become for ever inseparable from it I would have wished that the mother who came to say goodnight to me would be one more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No; just as what I needed so that I could go to sleep happy, with that untroubled peace which no mistress has been able to give me since that time because one doubts them even at the moment one believes in them, and can never possess their hearts as I received in a kiss my mother's heart, complete, without the reservation of an afterthought, without the residue of an intention that was not for me was that it should be her, that she should incline over me that face marked below the eye by something that was, it seems, a blemish, and which I loved as much as the rest, so what I want to see again is the Guermantes way that I knew, with the farm that is not very far from the two that come after pressed so close together, at the entrance to the avenue of oaks; those meadows on which, when the sun turns them reflective as a pond, the leaves of the apple trees are sketched, that landscape whose individuality",4.2107588484936675,1.1130644838312733,0.4537120948940625,0.046548427331780676,4.193370165745856,4.0,2.2616573937811015,69.61538461538461,51.5,45.18430371019507,1.229281767955801,1.0,0.5785522349473902,1810,632,0.34917127071823206,7791,26,65.22769514123382,2.128276585453152e+28,1.0604267989303198e+25,0.9095475792884826,0.8980545078714689,32.178147046323886,26.065524861878448,13.518907172268552,29.746706332341688,33.12846578835529,8.431823204419885,84.58776030599235,10.423076923076923,True,1172.0,0.9038365719980069,3.881913303437967,2007.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02335522886038995,0.013554373892190595,0.008341153164424981,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006255864873318737,0.013137316233969347,0.0,0.004982561036372696,42,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"she moved or into which he had drawn her. 'No use depending on Swann for this evening, they would say. Don't you remember it's his American's night at the Opera?' He would see to it that she was invited to the particularly exclusive salons where he was a constant guest, where he had his weekly dinners, his poker; every evening, after a slight crimp was added to the brush-cut of his red hair, tempering with some gentleness the vivacity of his green eyes, he would choose a flower for his buttonhole and go off to join his mistress at dinner at the home of one or another of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the admiration and affection which the fashionable people for whom he was the be-all and end-all and whom he was going to find there would lavish on him in the presence of the woman he loved, he would find some fresh charm in this worldly life to which he had become indifferent but whose substance, penetrated and warmly coloured by a flame that had been insinuated into it and flickered there, seemed to him precious and beautiful as soon as he had incorporated into it a new love. But, while each of these love affairs, or each of these flirtations, had been the more or less complete fulfilment of a dream inspired by the sight of a face or of a body that Swann had spontaneously, without making any effort to do so, found charming, on the contrary when he was introduced to Odette de Crecy one day at the theatre by an old friend of his, who had spoken of her as an entrancing woman with whom he might perhaps have some success, but making her out to be more difficult than she really was in order to appear to have done him a bigger favour by introducing her to him, she had seemed to Swann not without beauty, certainly, but as having a kind of beauty that left him indifferent, that aroused no desire in him, even caused him a sort of physical repulsion, one of those women such as everyone has his own, different for each, who are the opposite of the type our senses crave. Her profile was too pronounced for his taste, her skin too delicate, her cheekbones too prominent, her features too pinched. Her eyes were lovely, but so large they bent under their own mass, exhausted the rest of her face and always gave her a look of being in ill-health or ill-humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre, she had written to ask if she could see his collections, which interested her so, 'she, an ignoramus with a taste for pretty things,' saying that it seemed to her she would understand him better when she had seen him in 'his home',10 where she imagined him to be 'so comfortable with his tea and his books', though she had not hidden her surprise that he should live in that part of town, which must be so dreary and 'which was so un-smart for a man who was so very smart himself'. And after he had allowed her to come, as she left she had told him how sorry she was to have spent such a short time in a house that she had been so glad to enter, speaking of him as though he meant something more to her than the other people she knew, and seeming to establish between their two selves a sort of romantic bond that had made him smile. But at the age, already a little disillusioned, which Swann was approaching, at which one knows how to content oneself with being in love for the pleasure of it without requiring too much reciprocity, this closeness of two hearts, if it is no longer, as it was in one's earliest youth, the goal towards which love necessarily tends, still remains linked to it by an association of ideas so strong that it may become the cause of love, if it occurs first. At an earlier time one dreamed of possessing the heart of the woman with whom one was in love; later, to feel that one possesses a woman's heart may be enough to make one fall in love with her. And so, at an age when it would seem, since what one seeks most of all in love is subjective pleasure, that the enjoyment of a woman's beauty should play the largest part in it, love may come into being love of the most physical kind without there having been, underlying it, any previous desire. At this time of life, one has already been wounded many times by love; it no longer evolves solely in accordance with its own unknown and inevitable laws, before our astonished and passive heart. We come to its aid, we distort it with memory, with suggestion. Recognizing one of its symptoms, we recall and revive the others. Since we know its song, engraved in us in its entirety, we do not need a woman to repeat the beginning of it filled with the admiration that beauty inspires in order to find out what comes after. And if she begins in the middle where the two hearts come together, where it sings of living only for each other we are accustomed enough to this music to join our partner right away in the passage where she is waiting for us. Odette de Crecy came to see Swann again, then visited him more and more often; and no doubt each visit renewed his disappointment at finding himself once again in the presence of that face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the meantime and which he had not recalled as being either so expressive or, despite her youth, so faded; he felt sorry, as she talked to him, that her considerable beauty was not the sort he would spontaneously have preferred. Odette's face seemed thinner and sharper, in fact, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, those smoother and flatter surfaces, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that time drawn forward in fringes, lifted in 'switches', spread in stray locks down along the ears; and as for her body, which was admirably formed, it was difficult to discern its continuity (because of the fashions of the period, and even though she was one of the best-dressed women in Paris), because her blouse, jutting out as though over an imaginary paunch and ending abruptly in a point, below which the balloon of the double skirts swelled out, made a woman look as though she were composed of different parts poorly fitted inside one another; because the flounces, the flutes, the vest followed so independently, according to the whimsy of their design or the consistency of their material, the line that led to the knots, the puffs of lace, the perpendicular fringes of jet, or that directed them along the corset, but were in no way attached to the living person, who, depending on whether the architecture of these frills and furbelows approached too closely or moved too far away from her own, was either encased or lost in them. But when Odette had left, Swann would smile, thinking of how she told him the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he would recall the worried, shy air with which she had begged him once that it should not be too long, and the expression in her eyes at that moment, fastened on him in anxious entreaty, which made her look so touching under the bouquet of artificial pansies fastened to the front of her round white straw hat with its black velvet ribbons. 'And you, she had said, wouldn't you come to my house just once for tea?' He had pleaded unfinished work, a study in reality abandoned years before of Vermeer of Delft.11 'I realize I can't do anything, pitiful little me, compared with all you great scholars, she had answered. I would be like the frog in front of the Areopagus.12 And yet I would so love to educate myself, to be informed, to know things. How amusing it must be to pore over books, to bury your nose in old papers!' she had added with the self-satisfied air of an elegant woman declaring that she is happiest when abandoning herself without fear of getting dirty to some messy job, like doing a little cooking 'with her own hands in the dough'. 'You're going to make fun of me, but that painter who keeps you from seeing me (she meant Vermeer) I've never heard of him; is he still alive? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so that I could imagine what it is that you like, so that I could have some idea what's behind that great forehead that works so hard, inside that mind that I always sense is so busy with its thoughts, so that I could say to myself: there, this is what he's thinking about. What a joy it would be, to share in your work!' He apologized for his fear of new friendships, for what he had called, out of politeness, his fear of being unhappy. 'You're afraid of affection? How odd; that's all I ever look for, I would give my life to find it,' she had said in a voice so natural, so convinced, that he had been moved. 'Some woman must have hurt you. And you think all other women are like her. She must not have understood you; you're such an unusual person. That's what I liked about you right away, I really felt you weren't like anyone else. And you too, he had said to her, I know very well what women are like, you must be busy with a great many things, you must not have much time. Me! I never have anything to do! I'm always free, I will always be free for you. At any hour of the day or night that might be convenient for you to see me, send for me and I'll be only too happy to come immediately. Will you do it? Do you know what would be nice if you could obtain an introduction to Mme Verdurin; I go to her house every evening. Just imagine if we met there and I thought it was partly because of me that you were there!' And as he recalled their conversations this way, as he thought of her this way when he was alone, he was no doubt merely turning over her image among those of many other women in his romantic day-dreams; but if, due to some circumstance (or even perhaps not due",3.00795659954303,1.368729494838549,0.4272674120096287,0.10621258792374229,4.1702598120508565,4.0,2.219014265525833,37.6875,20.5,46.18673882999318,1.249861802100608,1.0,0.5971474782726341,1809,622,0.34383637368711994,7830,48,59.78542941297705,9.214718919179924e+25,4.4753370175715995e+22,0.7080342522723243,0.7015720621642211,62.84387904228856,13.856494264787177,11.37473899888905,17.286166390270868,17.055673714759536,7.935721393034822,52.11536069651741,5.4375,True,1200.0,0.8887809616318602,3.8028169014084505,2059.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00529595015576324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007476635514018692,0.003738317757009346,0.003426791277258567,0.0024283632831471587,45,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"friend or his mistress. In the opposite case, the 'newcomer' would in his turn become one of the faithful. And so when, that year, the demi-mondaine told M. Verdurin she had made the acquaintance of a charming man, M. Swann, and insinuated that he would be very pleased to be received at their home, M. Verdurin transmitted the request to his wife then and there. (He never formed an opinion until she had formed hers, his particular role being to carry out her wishes, along with those of the faithful, with great and resourceful ingenuity.) My dear, Mme de Crecy has something to ask you. She would like to introduce one of her friends to you, a M. Swann. What do you think? Well, now, who could refuse anything to a little angel like that? Quiet, no one asked your opinion. I tell you you're an angel. Well, if you say so, answered Odette in a mincing tone, and she added: you know I'm not fishing for compliments.5 All right! Bring your friend, if he's nice. Of course the 'little clan' had no connection to the society in which Swann moved, and true men of fashion would have felt there was little point in enjoying, as he did, an exceptional position only to end up with an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so fond of women that once he had come to know more or less all the women in aristocratic circles and they had nothing more to teach him, he had ceased to regard those naturalization papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, except as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no value in itself but which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little provincial hole or obscure circle of Paris where the daughter of a squire or clerk had struck him as pretty. For at such times desire or love would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life (although it was doubtless this feeling that had originally pointed him towards the career as man of fashion in which he had wasted his intellectual gifts in frivolous pleasures and allowed his erudition in matters of art to be used to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses), and which made him want to shine, in the eyes of any unknown woman with whom he was infatuated, with an elegance which the name Swann in itself did not imply. He wanted this most especially if the unknown woman was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by another man of intelligence that an intelligent man will be afraid of being thought stupid, so it is not by a great lord but by a country bumpkin that a man of fashion will be afraid of seeing his elegance go unappreciated. Three-quarters of the mental ingenuity and the lies told out of vanity that have been squandered since the world began by people who in doing so merely diminish themselves have been squandered on inferiors. And though Swann was unaffected and casual with a duchess, he trembled at being scorned by a chambermaid, and posed in front of her. He was not like so many people who, either from laziness or from a resigned sense of the obligation created by their social grandeur to remain attached to a certain mooring, abstain from the pleasures that life offers them outside the worldly situation in which they remain confined until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for lack of any better, once they have managed to become used to them, the mediocre amusements or bearable tedium it contains. Swann never tried to convince himself that the women with whom he spent his time were pretty, but tried instead to spend his time with women he already knew were pretty. And these were often women of rather vulgar beauty, for the physical qualities that he looked for without realizing it were the direct opposite of those he admired in the women sculpted or painted by the masters he preferred. Depth of expression, melancholy would freeze his senses, which needed only, in order to be awakened, flesh that was healthy, buxom and pink. If in his travels he met a family whom it would have been more distinguished not to seek to know, but among whom he saw one woman adorned with a charm which he had never experienced before, to 'stand on his dignity' and cheat the desire she had inspired, to substitute a different pleasure for the pleasure he might have known with her, by writing to a former mistress to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication before life, as stupid a renunciation of a new happiness as if, instead of touring the region, he had shut himself up in his room looking at pictures of Paris. He did not shut himself up in the edifice of his relationships, but had transformed that edifice, in order to be able to raise it again on the spot wherever he found a woman who pleased him, into one of those collapsible tents of the kind explorers carry with them. As for what was not transportable or exchangeable for a new pleasure, he would have given it away for nothing, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up from the desire she had been accumulating over the years to do something kind for him without having found the occasion, been spent all at once by his sending her an indiscreet message asking for a recommendation by telegraph that would put him in touch, immediately, with one of her stewards whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man would barter a diamond for a piece of bread! He had even, after the fact, been amused by it, for there existed in him, compensated for by uncommon refinements, a certain boorishness. Then, too, he belonged to that category of intelligent men who have lived idle lives and who seek a consolation and perhaps an excuse in the idea that this idleness offers their intelligence objects just as worthy of interest as art or scholarship could offer, that 'Life' contains situations more interesting, more novelistic than any novel. So he declared, at least, and easily convinced even the sharpest of his society friends, in particular the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to entertain with tales of the racy adventures he had had, such as when he had met a woman on the railway train and afterwards taken her back home with him, and then discovered that she was the sister of a monarch who at that time held in his hands all the mingled threads of European politics, thus finding he was kept abreast of them in a most agreeable way, or when, through a complex play of circumstances, the choice about to be made by the conclave6 was going to determine whether or not he succeeded in sleeping with somebody's cook. And it was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians with whom he was particularly close, whom Swann compelled with such cynicism to serve him as go-betweens. All his friends were used to receiving periodic letters from him in which a word of recommendation or introduction was asked of them with a diplomatic skill that, persisting as it did through his successive love affairs and varying pretexts, revealed, more than moments of indiscretion would have done, a permanent disposition and an identical quest. I often asked to hear, many years later when I began to take an interest in his character because of the resemblances it offered to my own in completely different respects, how when he wrote to my grandfather (who was not my grandfather yet, for it was about the time of my birth that Swann's great love affair began, and it interrupted these habits for a long time), the latter, recognizing his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: 'It's Swann, about to ask for something: on guard!' And either from mistrust, or from the unconsciously diabolical spirit that incites us to offer a thing only to the people who do not want it, my grandparents would issue a blunt refusal to the most easily satisfied requests he addressed to them, as for instance to introduce him to a girl who dined at the house every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, each time Swann mentioned it to them again, to pretend they were no longer seeing, whereas all week long they would wonder who in the world they could invite with her, often finding no one in the end, because they would not ask the one who would have been so happy to come. Sometimes a certain couple, friends of my grandparents who until then had complained of never seeing Swann, would announce to them with satisfaction and perhaps a little desire to arouse their envy that he had become as charming as could be, that he was never out of their house. My grandfather did not want to cloud their pleasure but would look at my grandmother and hum: Quel est donc ce mystere? Je n'y puis rien comprendre.7 Vision fugitive. Dans ces affaires Le mieux est de ne rien voir.9 A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend: 'And Swann do you still see as much of him as ever?' the face of the man he was talking to would grow long: 'Never mention his name to me again! But I thought you were so close...' For several months he had, for instance, been intimate friends with cousins of my grandmother's, dining almost every day at their house. Suddenly, and without letting them know, he stopped coming. They thought he was ill, and my grandmother's cousin was about to send word asking for news of him, when in the pantry she found a letter from him left inadvertently in the cook's account book. In it he told the woman he was leaving Paris, that he would not be able to continue seeing her. She was his mistress, and when he broke it off with her, she was the only one he thought he needed to tell. But when his mistress of the moment was a woman of rank or at least one whose background was not too humble or her situation too irregular for him to arrange for her to be received in society, then for her he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which",3.4700427206809685,1.2073266161782603,0.4354017032996758,0.05368529917240252,4.41019955654102,4.0,2.4879367858125656,39.21739130434783,28.5,33.30420592545545,1.3303769401330376,1.0,0.6924903417645624,1804,654,0.3625277161862528,8182,46,58.15392342152215,1.8027190287619499e+25,8.950938573793197e+21,0.7973016772005294,0.7915201512250033,54.47945869083199,15.403230502265497,12.732780340731697,18.56943989202738,18.95073556348212,9.377206208425719,58.39699219126579,7.521739130434782,True,1124.0,0.9016881827209533,4.062562065541211,2014.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003205770386696053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006511721097976358,0.0036064916850330597,0.0,0.004468718967229395,44,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to it, since a circumstance that presents itself at the moment when a state of mind, latent until then, comes out into the open may possibly not have influenced it in any way) the image of Odette de Crecy came to absorb all these day-dreams, if these day-dreams were no longer separable from the memory of her, then the imperfection of her body would no longer have any importance, nor would the fact that it might be, more or less than some other body, to Swann's taste, since, now that it had become the body of the woman he loved, it would be the only one capable of filling him with joy and torment. As it happened, my grandfather had known which was more than could be said of any of their current friends the family of these Verdurins. But he had lost all contact with 'young Verdurin', as he called him, whom he regarded, somewhat approximately, as having fallen even while holding on to his many millions among bohemians and riff-raff. One day, he received a letter from Swann asking him if he could put him in touch with the Verdurins: 'On guard! On guard!' my grandfather had exclaimed. 'This doesn't surprise me at all; it's just where Swann was bound to end up. A nice group they are! In the first place, I can't do what he asks, because I don't know the gentleman in question any more. And secondly, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I never get mixed up in such affairs. Well, well! We shall have a rather amusing time of it if Swann falls in with the young Verdurins.' And after my grandfather returned a negative answer, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the Verdurins'. The Verdurins had had to dinner, on the day Swann made his first appearance there, Doctor and Mme Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter who was in their favour at the time, and these were joined during the evening by several other faithful regulars. Doctor Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to answer someone, whether the person addressing him wanted to make a joke or was serious. And just in case, he would add to each of his facial expressions the offer of a conditional and tentative smile whose expectant shrewdness would exculpate him from the reproach of naivety, if the remark that had been made to him was found to have been facetious. But since, so as to respond to the opposite hypothesis, he did not dare allow that smile to declare itself distinctly on his face, one saw an uncertainty perpetually floating upon it in which could be read the question he did not dare ask: 'Are you saying this in earnest?' He was no more sure how he ought to behave in the street, and even in life generally, than in a drawing-room, and he could be seen greeting passers-by, carriages and any minor event that occurred with the same ironic smile that removed all impropriety from his attitude in advance, since he was proving that if the attitude was not a fashionable one he was well aware of it and that if he had adopted it, it was as a joke. On all points, however, where a direct question seemed to him permissible, the doctor did not fail to endeavour to reduce the field of his doubts and complete his education. And so, acting on the advice given him by a foresightful mother when he left her province, he never let pass either an expression or a proper name that was unknown to him, without trying to acquire documentation about it. In the case of expressions, he was insatiable for enlightenment, because, sometimes assuming they had a more precise meaning than they had, he wanted to know exactly what was meant by those he heard used most often: the bloom of youth, blue blood, a fast life, the hour of reckoning, to be a prince of refinement, to give carte blanche, to be nonplussed, etc., and in which specific cases he in his turn could introduce them into his conversation. If there were none, he would substitute puns he had learned. As for new names of people mentioned in his presence, he contented himself merely with repeating them in a questioning tone that he thought sufficient to procure him explanations without his appearing to ask for them. Since he completely lacked the critical faculty which he thought he exercised on everything, that refinement of politeness which consists in declaring to a person to whom you are doing a favour, without however expecting to be believed, that you are in fact indebted to him, was a waste of time with the doctor, who took everything literally. Whatever Mme Verdurin's blindness with respect to him, she had in the end, while continuing to find him very subtle, been annoyed to see that, when she invited him to share a box near the stage for a performance by Sarah Bernhardt, saying to him, to be especially gracious: 'It was too kind of you to come, Doctor, especially since I'm sure you've already heard Sarah Bernhardt many times, and we may also be too close to the stage,' Doctor Cottard, who had entered the box with a smile that was waiting to become more pronounced or to disappear as soon as some authoritative person informed him as to the quality of the entertainment, answered her: 'It's true that we're much too close and one begins to tire of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a desire that I should come. And your desire is my command. I am only too happy to do you this small service. Is there anything one would not do in order to please you, you're so good!' And he added: 'Sarah Bernhardt she is in fact the Golden Voice, isn't she? And they often write that she sets the stage on fire. That's an odd expression, isn't it?' in hope of commentaries which were not forthcoming. 'You know, Mme Verdurin had said to her husband, I believe we're steering the wrong course when we belittle our gifts to the doctor out of modesty. He's a man of science, out of touch with the practical side of life, he has no idea of the value of things and relies on what we tell him. I hadn't dared say anything to you, but I had noticed,' answered M. Verdurin. And the following New Year's Day, instead of sending Doctor Cottard a three-thousand-franc ruby, remarking that it was only a trifle, M. Verdurin paid three hundred francs for an artificial stone, implying that it would be hard to find one as beautiful. When Mme Verdurin had announced that they would be having M. Swann at the soiree, 'Swann?' the doctor had exclaimed in a tone of voice made rough by surprise, for the slightest piece of news always caught him more off guard than anyone else, though this was a man who believed he was perpetually prepared for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, 'Swann? Who's this Swann?' he roared, filled with an anxiety that suddenly abated when Mme Verdurin said: 'Why, the friend Odette told us about. Ah, good, good! That's all right then,' answered the doctor, pacified. As for the painter, he was delighted by the introduction of Swann to Mme Verdurin's, because he assumed Swann was in love with Odette and he liked to encourage love affairs. 'There's nothing I enjoy more than arranging a marriage, he confided in Doctor Cottard's ear. I've already managed a good many, even between women!' By telling the Verdurins that Swann was very 'smart', Odette had awoken in them the fear that he would be a 'bore'. However, he made an excellent impression, of which, without their knowing it, his association with fashionable society was one of the indirect causes. He had, in fact, over men who have never mixed in high society, even intelligent men, one of the superior qualities of those who have had some experience of it, which is that they no longer transfigure it out of the desire or the horror it inspires in their imagination, they consider it unimportant. Their friendliness, disassociated from any snobbery and from a fear of seeming too friendly, quite independent, has that ease, that grace characteristic of the motions of people whose supple limbs perform exactly what they want, without any indiscreet or awkward participation of the rest of the body. The simple elementary gymnastics of a man of the world extending his hand with good grace to the unknown young man who is being introduced to him, and bowing with reserve to the ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had in the end passed, without his being aware of it, into Swann's whole social attitude, so that towards people of a social circle inferior to his like the Verdurins and their friends he instinctively displayed a marked attention, permitted himself to make advances, from which, according to them, a bore would have refrained. He had a moment of coldness only with Cottard: seeing the doctor wink at him and smile ambiguously before they had spoken to each other (a dumb-show that Cottard called 'wait-and-see'), Swann thought the doctor probably recognized him from a previous encounter in some house of pleasure, even though he himself went to such places very seldom, having never lived in a world of debauchery. Finding the allusion in bad taste, especially in the presence of Odette, who might receive a poor impression of him from it, he assumed an icy manner. But when he learned that the lady standing near him was Mme Cottard, he thought that such a young husband would not have tried to allude to amusements of that sort in front of his wife; and he ceased to give the doctor's knowing look the meaning he had feared. The painter immediately invited Swann to come to his studio with Odette; Swann thought he was nice. 'Perhaps he'll favour you more than he has me, said Mme Verdurin in a tone of mock resentment, perhaps he'll show you Cottard's portrait' (she had commissioned it from the painter). 'Make sure, ""Monsieur"" Biche,' she reminded the painter, whom it was a sacred joke to address as Monsieur, 'to capture that nice look in his eye, that subtle, amusing little way he has of looking at you. As you know, what I want most of all is his smile; what I asked you for was a portrait of his smile.' And since the phrase seemed to her noteworthy, she repeated it very loudly to make sure a number of guests heard it, and even, using some vague",3.1699715794499337,1.1124659174579652,0.42876255615139297,0.0712554609560571,4.381004969630038,4.0,2.4299241785503805,31.224137931034484,23.0,27.16872130521209,1.3186085035891772,1.0,0.6692599130901903,1811,642,0.3545002760905577,8279,58,65.23621382647366,2.1464841459191844e+28,1.0153661995833417e+25,0.7692634842374868,0.7622562197170087,63.588220596355626,12.146994135455742,12.00464349962824,15.581869418686573,14.816602372474726,9.012324682495855,50.16395018945525,5.913793103448276,True,1142.0,0.8703878902554399,3.916272469252602,2114.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005556106756622681,0.0034725667228891755,0.0,0.01229895931882687,46,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pretext, summoned a few of them over to her first. Swann asked to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good nature had lost him all the esteem he had won by his skill as an archivist, his substantial fortune and the distinguished family he came from. When he talked, there was a sort of mushy sound to his pronunciation that was charming because one sensed that it betrayed not so much an impediment in his speech as a quality of his soul, a sort of vestige of early childhood innocence that he had never lost. Each consonant he could not pronounce appeared to be another instance of a hardness of which he was incapable. In asking to be introduced to M. Saniette, Swann appeared to Mme Verdurin to be reversing roles (to the degree that in response, she said, insisting on the difference: 'Monsieur Swann, would you have the goodness to allow me to introduce to you our friend Saniette'), but aroused in Saniette a warm feeling of congeniality which the Verdurins, however, never revealed to Swann, for Saniette irritated them a little, and they were not anxious to make friends for him. But, on the other hand, Swann touched them infinitely by believing he ought to ask immediately to be introduced to the pianist's aunt. She was in a black dress, as always, because she thought one always looked nice in black and that it was most distinguished, and her face was extremely red, as it always was after she had just eaten. She bowed to Swann with respect, but straightened with majesty. Because she had no education and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar, she deliberately pronounced things in a garbled way, thinking that if she made a blunder it would be fogged over by such indefiniteness that no one would be able to make it out with any certainty, so that her conversation was reduced to an indistinct hawking, from which emerged now and then the few vocables of which she felt confident. Swann thought he could poke a little fun at her when he was talking to M. Verdurin, but the latter was offended. 'She's such an excellent woman, he answered. I grant you she's not brilliant; but I assure you she can be most agreeable when you talk to her on your own. I don't doubt it, Swann hastened to concede. I meant to say she did not seem to me ""eminent"", he added, isolating the adjective, and really that's rather a compliment! Well, now, said M. Verdurin, this will surprise you: she writes charmingly. You've never heard her nephew? He's wonderful, isn't he, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, Monsieur Swann? Why, it would be a joy...' Swann was beginning to answer, when the doctor interrupted him with a mocking look. In fact, having acquired the notion that in conversation, to be emphatic, to employ formal expressions was old-fashioned, as soon as he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'joy' had just been used, he thought the person who had uttered it had just been guilty of pomposity. And if, in addition, the word happened to occur in what he called an old cliche, however current it might be in other respects, the doctor would assume that the sentence that had been begun was ridiculous and would finish it ironically using the platitude he seemed to be accusing the speaker of having wanted to deploy, although the latter had never thought of it. A joy for ever! he cried mischievously, raising his arms for emphasis. M. Verdurin could not help laughing. What are those good people laughing about! You don't seem to be having a bad time over there in your corner, cried Mme Verdurin. I hope you don't think I'm enjoying myself here in disgrace all by myself, she added in a tone of childish chagrin. Mme Verdurin was sitting on a high Swedish chair of waxed pine, which she had been given by a violinist from that country and which she had kept, though it looked rather like a stool and was at odds with the beautiful old furniture that she had, but she insisted on keeping in evidence the gifts which the faithful regulars were in the habit of giving her from time to time, so that the givers would have the pleasure of spotting them when they came. And so she tried to persuade them to give her nothing but flowers and sweets, which are at least perishable; but she was not successful, and her home contained a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and urns, in an accumulation of useless, repetitive and incongruous offerings. From this elevated spot she participated energetically in the conversation of the faithful and enjoyed their banter, but after the accident involving her jaw, she had ceased to take pains to explode in true laughter and indulged, instead, in a conventional pantomime that signified, without fatigue or risk for her, that she was laughing to the point of tears. At the mildest remark fired off by a regular against a bore or against a former regular who had been flung back into the camp of the bores and to the greatest despair of M. Verdurin, who for a long time had had pretensions of being as affable as his wife, but who, when laughing in earnest, would soon get out of breath and so had been outdistanced and defeated by this ruse of incessant and fictive hilarity she would utter a little cry, tightly close her bird-like eyes, already slightly dimmed by leucoma, and abruptly, as if she had only just had time to avoid some indecent spectacle or avert a fatal blow, plunging her face in her hands, which covered it and hid it completely, would appear to be doing her best to suppress, to annihilate a fit of laughter which, had she given way to it, would have caused her to faint. So, dazed by the gaiety of the faithful, drunk with good-fellowship, scandal and approbation, Mme Verdurin, poised on her perch, like a bird whose seed-cake has been soaked in warm wine, sobbed with affability. Meanwhile, M. Verdurin, after asking Swann's permission to light his pipe ('we don't stand on ceremony here, we're among friends'), begged the young musician to sit down at the piano. Now don't bother him, he didn't come here to be tormented, exclaimed Mme Verdurin, I won't have him tormented! But why on earth should it bother him? said M. Verdurin. Perhaps M. Swann doesn't know the Sonata in F sharp which we've discovered. He'll play the piano arrangement for us. Oh, no, no, not my sonata! cried Mme Verdurin. I don't want to have to cry until I get a head cold and neuralgia in my face, the way I did last time. Thanks for your offer, but I don't intend to repeat that performance. You're so kind, all of you; it's easy to see you're not the ones who will have to stay in bed for a week! This little scene, which was re-enacted each time the pianist prepared to play, enchanted her friends as much as if it had been brand new, because it was proof of the 'Patronne's'13 charming originality and sensitivity to music. Those who were near her signalled to those farther away who were smoking or playing cards to come closer, that something was happening, saying to them, as they do in the Reichstag at interesting moments: 'Listen, listen.' And the next day they would tell those who had not been able to be there how sorry they were, reporting that the scene had been even more entertaining than usual. Well, all right then, said M. Verdurin. He'll just play the andante. Just the andante! What are you saying! exclaimed Mme Verdurin. It's precisely the andante that completely paralyses me. Listen to the Patron! He's really marvellous! It's as if he said: in the Ninth we'll just hear the finale, or in The Meistersingers14 we'll just hear the overture. The doctor, however, urged Mme Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he thought the troubling effects the music had on her were feigned he recognized certain neurasthenic symptoms in them but from a habit which many doctors have, of immediately relaxing the severity of their prescriptions when something is involved that seems much more important to them, like some social gathering at which they are present and in which the person they are advising for once to forget his dyspepsia or his flu is an essential factor. You won't become ill this time, you'll see, he told her, trying to hypnotize her with his eyes. And if you do, we'll look after you. Really and truly? answered Mme Verdurin, as if the hope of such a favour left her no alternative but to capitulate. Perhaps also, because she said she would be ill, there were times when she did not recall that it was a lie and took on the character of an ill person. For invalids, tired of always having to make the rarity of their attacks dependent on their prudence, like to indulge in the belief that they can with impunity do all of the things that give them pleasure and usually hurt them, as long as they put themselves in the hands of a powerful person who, without their having to take any pains, with a word or a pill will put them back on their feet. Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered couch near the piano: You know I have my own little spot, she said to Mme Verdurin. The latter, seeing Swann on a chair, made him get up: You're not very comfortable there: now go and sit next to Odette. You'll make room for M. Swann there, won't you, Odette? What a pretty Beauvais, said Swann before he sat down, trying to be pleasant. Oh, I'm glad you appreciate my couch, answered Mme Verdurin. And let me tell you, if you think you're ever going to see another one as beautiful, you may abandon the idea at once. They never did anything else like it. The little chairs are marvels too. You can look at them in a moment. Each bronze is an emblem that corresponds to the little subject on the chair; you know, you'll have a great deal to entertain you if you want to look at them. I can promise you a good time. Even the little friezes around the edges look at that, look at the little vine against the red background in the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they",2.689460683684728,1.0704853048703484,0.41235756125042644,0.08016486262198241,4.331488655229663,4.0,2.409449013051643,23.166666666666668,13.5,25.847886719483427,1.306585500830105,1.0,0.6679274507276938,1807,653,0.36137244050913114,8214,78,66.59764364909114,8.375083478619905e+28,3.969233876123177e+25,0.7098972771268386,0.6790178520114798,72.78369996310647,8.862708909795241,10.837101786355626,12.409998155321897,10.554644899465046,8.391455451023798,41.761021951669434,4.3076923076923075,True,1135.0,0.876303317535545,3.8928909952606636,2110.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00798881565807869,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005991611743559017,0.006490912722188935,0.005692031156381066,0.013744075829383886,47,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"really knew how to draw! Doesn't that vine make your mouth water? My husband claims I don't like the fruit you get from it because I don't eat as many as he does. The fact is, actually, I'm more of a glutton than any of you, but I don't need to put them in my mouth because I enjoy them with my eyes. What are you all laughing about, now? Ask the doctor, he'll tell you for me grapes are a regular purgative. Other people take the cure at Fontainebleau, I take my little Beauvais cure. But, Monsieur Swann, you won't go away without feeling the little bronzes on the backs! Isn't the patina soft? No, no with your whole hand: feel them properly. Ah, if Madame Verdurin begins fondling the bronzes, we won't hear any music tonight, said the painter. You be quiet. You're a rascal. In fact, she said, turning to Swann, we women are forbidden to do things far less voluptuous than this. But no flesh can compare to it! When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being jealous of me come now, be polite at least, don't say you never were... But I said absolutely nothing. Doctor, be my witness: did I say anything? Swann was feeling the bronzes to be polite and did not dare stop right away. Come, you can caress them later; now you're the one who's going to be caressed. Your ears are going to be caressed; you'll like that, I think; here's the dear young man who'll be doing it. Now after the pianist had played, Swann was even friendlier to him than to the others who were present. This is why: The year before, at a soiree, he had heard a piece of music performed on the piano and violin. At first, he had experienced only the physical quality of the sounds secreted by the instruments. And it had been a keen pleasure when, below the little line of the violin, slender, unyielding, compact and commanding, he had seen the mass of the piano part all at once struggling to rise in a liquid swell, multiform, undivided, smooth and colliding like the purple tumult of the waves when the moonlight charms them and lowers their pitch by half a tone. But at a certain moment, without being able to distinguish an outline clearly, or give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly charmed, he had tried to gather up and hold on to the phrase or harmony he himself did not know which that was passing by him and that had opened his soul so much wider, the way the smells of certain roses circulating in the damp evening air have the property of dilating our nostrils. Maybe it was because of his ignorance of music that he had been capable of receiving so confused an impression, the kind of impression that is, however, perhaps the only one which is purely musical, immaterial, entirely original, irreducible to any other order of impression. An impression of this kind, is for an instant, so to speak, sine materia. No doubt the notes we hear then tend already, depending on their loudness and their quantity, to spread out before our eyes over surfaces of varying dimensions, to trace arabesques, to give us sensations of breadth, tenuousness, stability, whimsy. But the notes vanish before these sensations are sufficiently formed in us not to be submerged by those already excited by the succeeding or even simultaneous notes. And this impression would continue to envelop with its liquidity and its 'mellowness' the motifs that at times emerge from it, barely discernible, immediately to dive under and disappear, known only by the particular pleasure they give, impossible to describe, recall, name, ineffable if memory, like a labourer working to put down lasting foundations in the midst of the waves, by fabricating for us facsimiles of these fleeting phrases, did not allow us to compare them to those that follow them and to differentiate them. And so, scarcely had the delicious sensation which Swann had felt died away than his memory at once furnished him with a transcription that was summary and temporary but at which he could glance while the piece continued, so that already, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer impossible to grasp. He could picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical groupings, its notation, its expressive value; he had before him this thing which is no longer pure music, which is drawing, architecture, thought, and which allows us to recall the music. This time he had clearly distinguished one phrase rising for a few moments above the waves of sound. It had immediately proposed to him particular sensual pleasures which he had never imagined before hearing it, which he felt could be introduced to him by nothing else, and he had experienced for it something like an unfamiliar love. With a slow rhythm it led him first here, then there, then elsewhere, towards a happiness that was noble, unintelligible and precise. And then suddenly, having reached a point from which he was preparing to follow it, after an instant's pause, abruptly it changed direction, and with a new movement, quicker, slighter, more melancholy, incessant and sweet, it carried him off with it towards unfamiliar vistas. Then it disappeared. He wished passionately to see it a third time. And it did indeed reappear but without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a sensual pleasure that was less profound. But once he was back at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman he has glimpsed for only a moment as she passed by has introduced the image of a new sort of a beauty that increases the value of his own sensibility, without his even knowing if he will ever see this woman again whom he loves already and of whom he knows nothing, not even her name. It even seemed, for a moment, that this love for a phrase of music would have to open in Swann the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had for so long given up directing his life towards an ideal goal and limited it to the pursuit of everyday satisfactions that he believed, without ever saying so formally to himself, that this would not change as long as he lived; much worse, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideas, he had ceased to believe in their reality, though without being able to deny it altogether. Thus he had acquired the habit of taking refuge in unimportant thoughts that allowed him to ignore the fundamental essence of things. Just as he did not ask himself if it would have been better for him not to go into society, but on the other hand knew quite certainly that if he had accepted an invitation he ought to go and that if he did not pay a call afterwards he must at least leave cards, so in his conversation he endeavoured never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about things, but to furnish material details that had some sort of value in themselves and allowed him not to show his real capacities. He was extremely precise when it came to the recipe for a dish, the date of a painter's birth or death, the nomenclature of his works. Now and then, despite everything, he went so far as to utter a judgment on a work, on someone's interpretation of life, but he would then give his remarks an ironic tone, as if he did not entirely subscribe to what he was saying. Now, like certain confirmed invalids in whom, suddenly, a country they have arrived in, a different diet, sometimes a spontaneous and mysterious organic development seem to bring on such a regression of their ailment that they begin to envisage the unhoped-for possibility of belatedly starting a completely different life, Swann found within himself, in the recollection of the phrase he had heard, in certain sonatas he asked people to play for him, to see if he would not discover it in them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe and to which, as if the music had had a sort of sympathetic influence on the moral dryness from which he suffered, he felt in himself once again the desire and almost the strength to devote his life. But, since he had not succeeded in finding out who had composed the work he had heard, he had not been able to acquire it for himself and had ended by forgetting it. True, during the week he had encountered several people who had been with him at that party and he had asked them about it; but many had arrived after the music or left before; some were indeed there while it was performed but had gone into the other drawing-room to talk, and others, who had stayed to listen, had heard no more of it than had the first group. As for the master and mistress of the house, they knew it was a recent work which the musicians whom they had hired had asked to play; since the latter had gone off on a tour, Swann could not find out anything more. He had many friends who were musicians, but though he recalled the special and inexpressible pleasure the phrase had given him, and saw before his eyes the shapes it outlined, he was not able to sing it for them. Then he stopped thinking about it. Now, scarcely a few minutes after the young pianist had begun playing at Mme Verdurin's, suddenly, after a high note held for a long time through two measures, he saw it approaching, escaping from under that prolonged sonority stretched like a curtain of sound hiding the mystery of its incubation, he recognized it, secret, murmuring and divided, the airy and redolent phrase that he loved. And it was so particular, it had a charm so individual, which no other charm could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had encountered in a friend's drawing-room a person whom he had admired in the street and despaired of ever finding again. In the end, diligent, purposeful, it receded through the ramifications of its perfume, leaving on Swann's face the reflection of its smile. But now he could ask the name of his stranger (they told him it was the andante from the Sonata for piano and violin by Vinteuil), he possessed it, he could have it in his house as often as he liked, try to learn its language and its secret. And so when the pianist had finished, Swann went up to him to express a gratitude",3.073013441944334,1.0538236164908543,0.4267542871969098,0.07472556515567061,4.397450110864745,4.0,2.462808533071733,31.103448275862068,22.0,26.67860414534232,1.3386917960088691,1.0,0.7024108439525232,1804,667,0.3697339246119734,8222,58,64.41583866090072,9.450249564147924e+27,4.596424885285955e+24,0.8175203319181475,0.8052868326859814,62.0116740576497,12.336908020490863,12.067815424952059,15.589938068659684,14.83371416010398,9.105343680709531,51.11453475036318,6.224137931034483,True,1148.0,0.8881322957198443,3.9990272373540856,2056.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004789463181001796,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012572340850129714,0.004789463181001796,0.0,0.0029182879377431907,48,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"whose warmth was very pleasing to Mme Verdurin. He's a charmer, isn't he? she said to Swann. You might say he knows a thing or two about that sonata, the little devil. You didn't know the piano could achieve such things. It's everything except a piano! My word! I'm startled by it every time; I think I'm hearing an orchestra. Though it's even more beautiful than an orchestra, more complete. The young pianist bowed, and with a smile, stressing the words as if he were making a witty remark: You're very generous to me, he said. And while Mme Verdurin was saying to her husband: 'Come, give him some orangeade, he certainly deserves it,' Swann was describing to Odette how he had been in love with that little phrase. When Mme Verdurin said, from a little way off: 'Well now, it seems to me someone is saying sweet things to you, Odette,' she answered: 'Yes, very sweet,' and Swann found her simplicity delightful. Meanwhile, he was asking for information about Vinteuil, about his work, about the period of his life in which he had composed this sonata, about what the little phrase could have meant to him, this was what he would have liked to know most of all. But all these people who professed to admire that musician (when Swann had said that his sonata was truly beautiful, Mme Verdurin had exclaimed: 'I should say it's beautiful! But one simply doesn't admit that one does not know Vinteuil's sonata, one is not allowed not to know it,' and the painter had added: 'Ah, yes! It's a work of genius, isn't it? It may not be what you would call ""obvious"" or ""popular"", is it? But it makes a very great impression on us artists'), these people seemed never to have asked themselves these questions, for they were incapable of answering them. In answer to one or two particular remarks that Swann made about his favourite phrase, Mme Verdurin went so far as to say: Well now, that's funny, I never paid any attention. I'll tell you, I don't very much enjoy nit-picking or discussing fine points; we don't waste our time splitting hairs here, it's not that kind of a house, while Doctor Cottard watched her with speechless admiration and zealous studiousness as she frolicked in this billow of stock expressions. He and Mme Cottard, however, with a kind of good sense which is also possessed by certain people from humble backgrounds, carefully refrained from offering an opinion or feigning admiration for a sort of music which they confessed to each other, once they were back home, they did not understand any more than the painting of 'Monsieur Biche'. Since, of the charm, the grace, the forms of nature, the public knows only what it has absorbed from the cliches of an art slowly assimilated, and since an original artist begins by rejecting these cliches, M. and Mme Cottard, being in this sense typical of the public, found neither in Vinteuil's sonata, nor in the painter's portraits, what for them created the harmony of music and the beauty of painting. It seemed to them when the pianist played the sonata that he was randomly attaching to the piano notes that were not in fact connected to the forms they were used to, and that the painter was randomly hurling colours on to his canvases. When they were able to recognize a form in these canvases, they found it heavy and vulgarized (that is, lacking the elegance of the school of painting through which they viewed all living creatures, even in the street), and lacking truth, as if Monsieur Biche did not know how a shoulder was constructed or that women do not have lavender hair. However, when the regulars had dispersed, the doctor felt this was a favourable opportunity, and while Mme Verdurin was saying a last word about Vinteuil's sonata, like a beginning swimmer who throws himself into the water in order to learn but chooses a moment when there are not too many people to see him, he exclaimed with sudden determination: Now, this is what one calls a musician di primo cartello! Swann learned only that the recent appearance of Vinteuil's sonata had made a strong impression on a school of very advanced tendencies, but was entirely unknown to the larger public. I know someone quite well named Vinteuil, said Swann, thinking of the piano-teacher who had taught my grandmother's sisters. Perhaps it's him, exclaimed Mme Verdurin. Oh, no! Swann answered, laughing. If you had ever spent just a minute or two with him, you wouldn't ask. Then, to ask the question is to answer it? said the doctor. But he could be a relative, Swann went on. That would be rather sad, but the fact is, a man of genius can be cousin to an old fool. If this is so, I confess I would submit to any kind of torture to get the old fool to introduce me to the composer of that sonata: starting with the torture of associating with the old fool, which would be frightful. The painter knew that Vinteuil was very ill at the moment and that Doctor Potain was afraid he would not be able to save him. What! cried Mme Verdurin. Are there people who still go to Potain? Ah, Madame Verdurin! said Cottard, in a tone of witty repartee, you forget that you're talking about one of my colleagues, I should say one of my teachers. The painter had heard that Vinteuil was threatened with mental illness. And he declared that one could perceive it in certain passages of his sonata. Swann did not find this comment absurd, but it bothered him; for since a pure work of music contains none of the logical relationships whose alteration in language reveals madness, madness recognized in a sonata seemed to him something as mysterious as the madness of a bitch, the madness of a horse, though these can indeed be observed. Don't upset me with talk about your ""teachers"". You know ten times as much as he does, Mme Verdurin answered Doctor Cottard, in the tone of a person who has the courage of her convictions and stoutly holds her own against those who are not of the same opinion. At least you don't kill your patients! But Madame, he belongs to the Academy,16 replied the doctor ironically. If a patient would rather die by the hand of one of the princes of science... It's much more stylish to be able to say: 'I'm being treated by Potain. It's more stylish? said Mme Verdurin. So there's such a thing as style in illness now? I wasn't aware of that... How funny you are! she exclaimed suddenly, dropping her face in her hands. And I was such a silly fool, talking about it seriously without seeing that you were pulling my leg. As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to force a laugh over such a trifle, he contented himself with drawing on his pipe, musing sadly that he would never be able to rival his wife in a contest of amiability. You know, we like your friend very much, said Mme Verdurin to Odette when the latter was wishing her a good night. He's so unaffected, he's so charming; if all the friends you think of introducing to us are like him, you may certainly bring them. M. Verdurin pointed out that Swann had not, however, appreciated the pianist's aunt. The man felt a little out of his element, answered Mme Verdurin. Now you wouldn't expect him to have caught the tone of the house already, the very first time, like Cottard, who has been one of our little clan for years. The first time doesn't count; it was useful for breaking the ice. Odette, it's agreed that he'll meet us tomorrow at the Chatelet. Will you pick him up? No, he doesn't want me to. Whatever you like, then. As long as he doesn't go and abandon us at the last minute! To Mme Verdurin's great surprise, he never abandoned them. He went to meet them wherever they were, sometimes in restaurants in the outlying districts where no one went much yet, because it was not the season, more often to the theatre, which Mme Verdurin liked very much; and because one day, at her house, she said in his presence that on evenings when there were premieres, or galas, a pass would have been very useful to them, that it had inconvenienced them very much not to have one the day of Gambetta's funeral,17 Swann, who never talked about his distinguished connections, but only about those which were not very highly esteemed, which he thought it indelicate to conceal, and among which he had, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, fallen into the habit of including his relations with the official world, answered: I promise to take care of it, you'll have it in time for the revival of Les Danicheff.18 As it appens, I'm having lunch with the Prefect of Police tomorrow at the Elysee Palace. What? At the Elysee Palace? shouted Doctor Cottard in a thunderous voice. Yes, at M. Grevy's,19 answered Swann, a little embarrassed by the effect his remark had produced. And the painter said to the doctor as a joke: Do you have these attacks very often? Generally, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: 'Oh, I see, that's all right then,' and not show a trace more of emotion. But this time, Swann's last words, instead of procuring him the usual peace of mind, raised to a fever pitch his astonishment that a man with whom he had dined, who had no official position, no celebrity of any sort, would hobnob with the Head of State. What do you mean, M. Grevy? You know M. Grevy? he said to Swann with the stupid and incredulous look of a policeman on guard at the palace who is asked by a stranger to see the President of the Republic, and who, realizing from these words 'what sort of person he is dealing with', as the newspapers say, assures the poor lunatic that he will be received immediately and leads him to the special infirmary of the central police station. I know him slightly, we have friends in common. (He did not dare say that one of them was the Prince of Wales.) Actually, he entertains a good deal, and I assure you these lunches aren't in the least amusing, they're also very simple, there are never more than eight at table, answered Swann, trying to expunge what had seemed to be too dazzling, in the doctor's eyes, about his relations with the President of the Republic. Immediately Cottard, trusting in the truth",2.6466310447409467,1.1062007765613147,0.4260011358679064,0.08865762011265793,4.347753743760399,4.0,2.3027821320716075,21.464285714285715,13.0,23.85444274711757,1.295618413754853,1.0,0.630802685026675,1803,615,0.3410981697171381,8262,84,67.96037418936376,3.27201660150242e+29,1.5282655775349929e+26,0.6730244978364691,0.6609428852978276,75.43943219633945,8.069368710878695,9.871247098662264,11.181388162586167,9.780062990254336,8.385757071547417,39.93350368433563,3.9642857142857144,True,1139.0,0.8664175618869687,3.85894441849603,2141.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011528523156430133,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016696481812760882,0.006459948320413436,0.005366726296958855,0.021018215787015414,49,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"eye to see whether he was setting them down properly in their consecrated places. She thought that, if even one were put where it should not be, the overall effect of her drawing-room would be ruined, and her portrait, placed on a sloping stand draped in plush, poorly lit. And so she fervently followed the movements of the ungainly man and reprimanded him sharply when he went too close to two flower stands which she took care to clean herself for fear they would be damaged and which she now went over to examine to see if he had chipped them. She thought all her Chinese knick-knacks had 'amusing' shapes, and also the orchids, the cattleyas22 especially, which were, along with the chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers, because they had the great merit of not resembling flowers, but of being made of silk, of satin. 'This one looks as though it were cut from the lining of my coat,' she said to Swann, showing him an orchid, with a suggestion of respect for this very 'chic' flower, for this elegant and unexpected sister which nature had given her, so far removed from her on the scale of living creatures and yet so refined, more deserving than many women of being given a place in her drawing-room. As she showed him, first, chimeras with tongues of fire decorating a vase or embroidered on a screen, then the corollas of a bouquet of orchids, then a dromedary of silver inlaid with niello with eyes encrusted with rubies that stood on the mantelpiece next to a jade toad, she affected, first, fear of the wickedness, or laughter at the oddity, of the monsters, then blushes at the indecency of the flowers and then an irresistible desire to go and kiss the dromedary and the toad, which she called: 'dears'. And these affections contrasted with the sincerity of certain of her devotions, notably to Our Lady of Laghet,23 who had once, when she lived in Nice, cured her of a fatal illness, and whose gold medal she always wore, attributing to it unlimited powers. Odette made Swann 'her' tea, asked him: 'Lemon or cream?' and when he answered 'cream,' said to him laughing: 'A cloud!' And when he found it good: 'You see I know what you like.' This tea, in fact, seemed as precious a thing to Swann as it did to her, and love has such need to find a justification for itself, a guarantee that it will last, in pleasures which in fact would not be pleasures without it and which end when it ends, that when he left her at seven o'clock to go home and dress, during the whole trip that he made in his coupe, unable to contain the joy which the afternoon had given him, he kept repeating to himself: 'How nice it would be to have a little woman like that in whose home one could always find that rare thing, a good cup of tea.' An hour later, he received a note from Odette and immediately recognized the large handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an appearance of discipline on ill-formed letters that would perhaps have signified, to less prejudiced eyes, an untidiness of mind, an insufficient education, a lack of frankness and resolution. Swann had forgotten his cigarette case at Odette's. 'If you had forgotten your heart here too, I would not have let you have it back.' A second visit he made to her was perhaps more important. Going to her house that day, as always when he was to see her, he pictured her to himself beforehand; and his need, if he was to find her face pretty, to limit what he imagined of her cheeks only to her fresh, pink cheekbones since the rest was so often yellow, languid, sometimes marked with little red specks, distressed him as proving that the ideal is inaccessible and happiness mediocre. He had brought her an engraving that she wanted to see. She was a little unwell; she received him in a mauve crepe de Chine dressing-gown, pulling the richly embroidered material over her chest like a cloak. Standing next to him, allowing her hair, which she had undone, to flow down her cheeks, bending one leg somewhat in the position of a dancer so that without getting tired she could lean over the engraving, which she looked at, inclining her head, with those large eyes of hers, so tired and sullen when she was not animated, she struck Swann by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's daughter, in a fresco in the Sistine Chapel.24 Swann had always had this peculiar penchant for liking to rediscover in the paintings of the masters not only the general characteristics of the real world that surrounds us, but what seems on the contrary the least susceptible to generalization, the individual features of the faces we know: for instance, in the material of a bust of the Doge Loredano by Antonio Rizzo,25 the jut of the cheekbones, the slant of the eyebrows, altogether the very evident resemblance to his coachman Remi; under the colours of a Ghirlandaio,26 M. de Palancy's nose; in a portrait by Tintoretto,27 the invasion of the cheek's fat by the implantation of the first hairs of the side-whiskers, the break in the nose, the penetration of the gaze, the congestion of the eyelids of Doctor du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always continued to feel a touch of remorse that he had limited his life to worldly relationships, to conversation, he believed he could find a sort of indulgent pardon granted him by the great artists, in the fact that they too had contemplated with pleasure, introduced into their work, faces like these, which give it a singular certificate of reality and of truth to life, a modern flavour; perhaps, also, he had allowed himself to be so caught up in the frivolity of the society people that he felt the need to look into an old work of art for these anticipated and rejuvenating allusions to current proper names. Perhaps, on the other hand, he still had enough of an artist's nature so that these individual characteristics gave him pleasure by assuming a more general meaning as soon as he saw them extirpated, emancipated, in the resemblance between an older portrait and an original which it did not represent. Whatever the case, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions that he had been receiving for some time, and even though this abundance had come to him more with his love of music, had enriched even his delight in painting, he now found a deeper pleasure and this was to exert a permanent influence on Swann in Odette's resemblance to Zipporah as painted by Sandro di Mariano, whom people call more often by his popular nickname of Botticelli, since that name evokes, not the painter's true work, but the vulgarized idea of it, banal and false. He no longer appraised Odette's face according to the finer or poorer quality of her cheeks and the purely flesh-coloured softness he supposed he must find when he touched them with his lips if he ever dared to kiss her, but as a skein of subtle and beautiful lines that his eyes reeled off, following the curve of their winding, joining the cadence of her nape to the effusion of her hair and the flexion of her eyelids, as in a portrait of her in which her type became intelligible and clear. He looked at her; a fragment of the fresco appeared in her face and in her body and from then on he would always try to find it in her again, whether he was with Odette, or was only thinking of her, and even though he probably valued the Florentine masterpiece only because he found it again in her, nevertheless that resemblance conferred a certain beauty on her too, made her more precious. Swann reproached himself for having misunderstood the value of a creature who would have appeared captivating to the great Sandro, and he felt happy that his pleasure in seeing Odette could be justified by his own aesthetic culture. He told himself that, in associating the thought of Odette with his dreams of happiness, he had not been resigning himself to a second-best as imperfect as he had believed until now, since she satisfied his most refined artistic tastes. He forgot that this did not make Odette any more the sort of woman he desired, since in fact his desire had always been oriented in a direction opposite to his aesthetic tastes. The words 'Florentine work of art' did Swann a great service. They allowed him, like a title, to bring Odette's image into a world of dreams to which she had not had access until then and where she was steeped in nobility. And, while the purely fleshly view he had had of this woman, by perpetually renewing his doubts about the quality of her face, her body, her whole beauty, had weakened his love, these doubts were vanquished, that love confirmed when he had instead, for a foundation, the principles of an unquestionable aesthetic; while the kiss and the possession that would seem natural and ordinary if they had been granted him by damaged flesh, if they came to crown the adoration of a museum piece, appeared to him necessarily supernatural and delicious. And when he was tempted to regret the fact that for months now he had done nothing but see Odette, he said to himself that it was reasonable to give a good deal of his time to an inestimable masterpiece, cast for once in a different and particularly savoury material, in a most rare exemplar that he contemplated sometimes with the humility, spirituality and disinterestedness of an artist, and sometimes with the pride, egotism and sensuality of a collector. He placed on his work table, as if it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's daughter. He admired the large eyes, the delicate face, which allowed one to imagine the imperfect skin, the marvellous curls of the hair along the tired cheeks, and adapting what he had found aesthetically beautiful up to then to the idea of a living woman, he translated it into physical attractions which he rejoiced to find united in a creature whom he could possess. The vague feeling of sympathy that draws us towards a masterpiece as we look at it became, now that he knew the fleshly original of Jethro's daughter, a desire that henceforth compensated for the desire that Odette's body had not at first inspired in him. When he had looked at that Botticelli for a long time, he would think of his own Botticelli, whom he found",3.9012848756828418,1.1789251769517015,0.4143300841509444,0.06629674016381794,4.492256637168142,4.0,2.568518088913414,51.65714285714286,44.0,41.667351286892554,1.342367256637168,1.0,0.7298452179152185,1808,680,0.37610619469026546,8380,35,62.58014422659183,1.507340313154357e+27,7.360060122824009e+23,0.8308592079316869,0.7964067242362283,40.83873008849561,20.3962193426043,15.266885465232114,24.158432364096083,25.55710018963338,10.041460176991151,72.28767383059419,10.657142857142857,True,1093.0,0.88916015625,4.091796875,2048.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010609037328094302,0.003241650294695481,0.0,0.0048828125,51,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"of what Swann had said, adopted the opinion, concerning the value of an invitation to M. Grevy's, that it was not a very desirable thing and could be picked up anywhere. From then on, he was no longer surprised that Swann, or anyone else, should visit the Elysee Palace, and he was even a little sorry for him because he had to go to lunches which Swann himself admitted were boring. Oh, I see, that's quite all right then, he said in the tone of a customs inspector who, though suspicious a moment before, after hearing your explanations gives you his visa and lets you go through without opening your bags. Oh, I believe you, I'm sure those lunches must not be very amusing, and it's good of you to go to them, said Mme Verdurin, who saw the President of the Republic as a bore to be especially dreaded because he had at his disposal various means of seduction and compulsion which, if employed upon the faithful, would be quite capable of making them desert her. Apparently he's as deaf as a doorpost and eats with his fingers. In that case, certainly it must not be much fun to go there, said the doctor with a touch of commiseration; and, recalling that eight was the number of guests at table: 'Are these intimate lunches?' he asked sharply with a linguist's zeal more than a snoop's curiosity. But the prestige of the President of the Republic in the eyes of the doctor ended by prevailing over both Swann's modesty and Mme Verdurin's animosity, and at each dinner Cottard would ask with interest: 'Will we be seeing M. Swann this evening? He's on personal terms with M. Grevy. Is he in fact what one would call a gentleman?'20 He even went so far as to present him with an invitation-card for the dentistry exhibition. This will admit you, along with anyone you might like to bring with you, but they won't let dogs in. You understand, I tell you this because some friends of mine didn't know and kicked themselves for it afterwards. As for M. Verdurin, he noticed the bad effect produced on his wife by the discovery that Swann had influential friends whom he had never mentioned. If they had not arranged a party somewhere, it was at the Verdurins' that Swann would join the little clan, but he came only in the evening, and almost never agreed to have dinner there despite Odette's earnest requests. I could even have dinner alone with you, if you would like that better, she would tell him. And what about Mme Verdurin? Oh, that would be easy enough. I would simply tell her my dress wasn't ready, or my cab came late. There's always a way to manage it. You're very sweet. But Swann said to himself that, if he showed Odette (by agreeing only to meet her after dinner) that there were other pleasures he preferred to the pleasure of being with her, a long time would pass before her appetite for him was surfeited. And, too, since he infinitely preferred to Odette's kind of beauty the beauty of a little working girl as fresh and plump as a rose with whom he was smitten, he chose to spend the beginning of the evening with her, being sure of seeing Odette afterwards. It was for the same reasons that he never agreed to have Odette pick him up on her way to the Verdurins'. The little working girl would wait for him near his house at a corner known to his coachman Remi, she would get in beside Swann and stay there in his arms until the moment the carriage drew up in front of the Verdurins'. When he came in, as Mme Verdurin, pointing to some roses he had sent in the morning, said to him: 'You deserve a scolding' and showed him a spot next to Odette, the pianist would play for the two of them the little phrase by Vinteuil that was like the national anthem of their love. He began with the sustained violin tremolos that are heard alone for a few measures, occupying the entire foreground, then all of a sudden they seemed to move away and, as in those paintings by Pieter de Hooch,21 which assume greater depth because of the narrow frame of a half-open door, away in the distance, in a different colour, in the velvetiness of an interposed light, the little phrase would appear, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It rippled past, simple and immortal, distributing here and there the gifts of its grace, with the same ineffable smile; but Swann thought he could now distinguish within it some disenchantment. It seemed to realize how futile was this happiness to which it was showing the way. In its light grace, there was something finished about it, like the detachment that follows regret. But this hardly mattered to him, he considered the phrase less in itself in what it could express to a musician who was unaware of his existence or of Odette's when he composed it, and to all those who would hear it in the centuries to come than as a token, a memory of his love which, even for the Verdurins, even for the young pianist, would remind them of Odette and him at the same time, would join them together; so much so that when Odette, capriciously, had begged him to, he had given up the idea of having some pianist play him the entire sonata, of which he knew as yet only this passage. 'Why would you need the rest? she had said to him. This is our piece.' And in fact, pained by the thought that, at the moment when it passed so close and yet infinitely far away, though it was addressed to them it did not know them, he was almost sorry it had any meaning, any intrinsic and unalterable beauty, alien to them, just as in jewels given to us, or even the letters written to us by a woman we love, we resent the water of the gem and the words of the language, because they are not created exclusively from the essence of a passing love affair and of a particular person. It often happened that he had lingered so late with the young working girl before going to the Verdurins' that after the little phrase had been played by the pianist, Swann would notice that it would soon be time for Odette to go home. He would drive her back as far as the door of her little house in the rue La Perouse behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps because of this, in order not to demand all her favours, that he sacrificed the less necessary pleasure of seeing her earlier, of arriving at the Verdurins' with her, to the exercise of this right to leave together which she recognized as his and to which he attached a greater value, since, because of it, he had the impression that no one else saw her, no one else came between them, stopped her from being with him still, after he left her. And so she would go back in Swann's carriage; one night, when she had just got out of it and he was saying he would see her tomorrow, she rushed to pick a last chrysanthemum from the little garden in front of the house and gave it to him before he went off. He held it pressed against his lips on the way home, and when after a few days the flower withered, he locked it with great care in his secretary-desk. But he never went into her house. Only twice, he had gone there in the afternoon to participate in that operation which was of such capital importance for her: 'having tea'. The isolation and emptiness of the short streets (almost all of them lined with small contiguous private houses, whose monotony would suddenly be interrupted by some sinister street-stall, the historic sign and sordid remains of a time when these districts were still in bad repute), the snow that lingered in the garden and on the trees, the slovenliness of the season, the proximity of nature, lent something more mysterious to the warmth, the flowers that he had found when he went in. Leaving to the left, on the raised ground floor, Odette's bedroom, which looked out on a little parallel street in the back, a straight staircase between walls painted a dark colour and hung with Oriental cloths, strings of Turkish beads and a large Japanese lantern suspended from a slender silk cord (but illuminated, so as not to deprive visitors of the latest comforts of Western civilization, with gas) led up to the drawing-room and the morning-room. These were preceded by a narrow vestibule whose wall, chequered by a garden trellis, but a gilded one, was lined down its entire length by a rectangular box in which bloomed, as in a greenhouse, a row of those fat chrysanthemums which were still rare at that time, yet nothing like the ones that horticulturalists later succeeded in obtaining. Swann was irritated by the fashion that had favoured them since the previous year, but he had taken pleasure, this time, in seeing the half-light of the room striped with pink, orange and white by the fragrant rays of these ephemeral stars which light up on grey days. Odette had received him in a morning-gown of pink silk, her neck and arms bare. She had had him sit next to her in one of the many mysterious alcoves that were contrived in the bays of the drawing-room, protected by immense palm trees contained in china flowerpot-holders, or by screens festooned with photographs, bows of ribbon and fans. She had said to him: 'You aren't comfortable like that, wait, I'll fix you up,' and with the conceited little laugh she would have given at some invention of her own, had settled behind Swann's head, and under his feet, cushions of Japanese silk which she kneaded as if she were lavish with these riches and careless of their value. But when the valet came bringing one after another the many lamps which, nearly all enclosed in large Chinese vases, burned singly or in pairs, all on different pieces of furniture as though on altars, and which had summoned back to the already almost nocturnal twilight of that late winter afternoon a more lasting sunset, rosier and more human perhaps making some lover stop and day-dream in the street before the mystery of the presence that was at once disclosed and concealed by the glowing panes she had watched the servant severely from the corner of her",3.4798858383287214,1.3034397197925234,0.4231832653453096,0.06026809080456867,4.32357813362783,4.0,2.2756463046003286,36.95918367346939,31.0,28.111265214975155,1.2849254555494203,1.0,0.6405143850774662,1811,672,0.37106570955273327,8123,49,64.63929760709615,1.1816538243203649e+28,5.727842095590717e+24,0.7868723571300507,0.7852560934868265,60.61673503194764,13.986202008136221,12.326154419758534,17.58875353564949,17.413644846121777,8.821755935946992,54.13201636259142,6.346938775510204,True,1127.0,0.8894813378574891,3.937469704314106,2063.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009271389700695354,0.0034263831502569786,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010279149450770936,0.007054318250529074,0.0,0.00872515753756665,50,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"at a place he had specified to him. The carriage did not return and Swann pictured to himself the approaching moment, as both the moment in which Remi would say to him: 'The lady is here,' and the moment in which Remi would say to him: 'The lady was not in any of the cafes.' And so he saw the end of the evening before him, single and yet alternative, preceded either by a meeting with Odette which would put an end to his agony, or by a forced renunciation of finding her this evening, by an acceptance of returning home without having seen her. The coachman came back, but at the moment he stopped in front of Swann, Swann did not say to him: 'Did you find the lady?' but: 'Now remind me, tomorrow, to order more wood; I think our supply must be starting to run out.' Perhaps he had told himself that if Remi had found Odette in some cafe where she was waiting for him, the end of the ill-fated evening would already be cancelled out by the realization, which was just beginning, of the blissful end of the evening and that he did not need to rush to seize a happiness that was already captured and held in a safe place, that would not be able to break free. But it was also from the force of inertia; there was in his disposition that lack of suppleness which certain people have in their bodies, those who at the moment when they need to avoid a collision, snatch a flame away from their clothing, perform any other urgent motion, take their time, begin by remaining for a second in the position in which they were before, as though to find in it their springboard, their source of momentum. And no doubt, if the coachman had interrupted him by saying: 'The lady is there,' he would have answered: 'Oh yes, of course, the errand I sent you on! Well, well! Is that so?' and would have gone on talking to him about supplies of wood in order to hide the emotion he felt and allow himself time to separate from his uneasiness and give himself up to his happiness. But the coachman came back to tell him he had not found her anywhere, and added his opinion, old servant that he was: I think that all Monsieur can do now is go home. But the indifference that Swann had no trouble feigning as long as Remi could do nothing further to change the answer he had brought back fell from him, when he saw Remi attempt to make him give up hope and abandon his search: No, not at all, he cried, we must find the lady; it's terribly important. She would be extremely annoyed it's a business matter she would be extremely offended, if she didn't see me. I don't see how the lady could be offended, answered Remi, since she's the one who left without waiting for Monsieur, and since she said she would go to Prevost's and then she wasn't there. Lights were beginning to go out all around him. Under the trees on the boulevards, in a mysterious darkness, fewer people wandered past, barely recognizable. Now and then the shadow of a woman coming up to him, murmuring a word in his ear, asking him to take her home, would make Swann start. He brushed anxiously against all those dim bodies as if, among the phantoms of the dead, in the kingdom of darkness, he were searching for Eurydice. Of all love's modes of production, of all the disseminating agents of the holy evil, surely one of the most efficacious is this great breath of agitation which sometimes blows down on us. Then the die is cast, and the person whose company we enjoy at the time is the one we will love. It is not even necessary for us to have liked him better than anyone else up to then, or even as much. What is necessary is that our predilection for him should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled when at a moment like this, when we do not have him with us the quest for the pleasures that his charm gave us is suddenly replaced in us by an anxious need whose object is this person himself, an absurd need which the laws of this world make impossible to satisfy and difficult to cure the senseless and painful need to possess him. Swann asked to be driven to the last remaining restaurants; it was only the hypothesis of happiness he had been able to envisage calmly; now he no longer hid his agitation, the value he placed on this meeting, and he promised a reward to his coachman if they were successful, as though, by inspiring him with a desire to succeed that would be added to his own, he could make Odette appear, even if she had already gone home to bed, in a restaurant on the boulevard. He pushed on as far as La Maison Doree, went into Tortoni's31 twice, and, still without having seen her had just come out of the Cafe Anglais32 again, walking fast with a wild look on his face, back to the carriage which was waiting for him at the corner of the boulevard des Italiens, when he bumped into someone coming in the opposite direction: it was Odette; later, she explained that she had not found a seat at Prevost's and so had gone to have supper at La Maison Doree in an alcove where he had not noticed her, and she was on her way back to her carriage. She had so little expected to see him that she started back in fear. And he himself had run all over Paris not because he thought it was possible to find her, but because it was too hard for him to give up the search. But the joy which his reason had continued to believe was beyond realization that night only seemed to him all the more real now; for since he had not collaborated with it by foreseeing its probabilities, it remained external to him; he did not need to reach into his mind in order to furnish it with truth, it was from itself that the truth emanated, it itself projected that truth towards him, that truth whose radiance dispelled like a dream the isolation he had so dreaded, that truth on which he now based, on which he now rested, without thinking, his happy reverie. In the same way, a traveller arriving at the Mediterranean shore on a day of fine weather, no longer certain whether the lands he has just left behind really exist, allows his vision to be dazzled, rather than looking at them himself, by the rays of light emitted in his direction by the luminous, resistant azure of the waters. He stepped up with her into the carriage that she had waiting there, and told his own to follow. She was holding a bunch of cattleyas in her hand and Swann saw, under her lace scarf, that she had flowers of the same orchid in her hair, fastened to a plume of swan feathers. She was dressed, under her mantilla, in a flood of black velvet caught up on one side to reveal in a wide triangle the hem of a skirt of white faille and showing a yoke, also of white faille, at the opening of a low-necked bodice tucked with more cattleya flowers. She had barely recovered from the fright Swann had given her when some obstacle made the horse shy. They were roughly jolted, she cried out and began trembling all over, breathless. It's all right, he said, don't be afraid. And he put his arm around her shoulder, supporting her against himself; then he said: Now don't talk to me, just answer with a sign so you don't get even more out of breath. It won't bother you, will it, if I straighten the flowers in your bodice? They were knocked out of place when the carriage lurched. I'm afraid you may lose them, I'll push them in a little. She was not used to seeing a man make such a fuss over her, and said, smiling: No, not at all, I don't mind in the least. But he, intimidated by her answer, and perhaps also so as to appear to have been sincere when he had used that excuse, or even beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: No, no! Don't talk, you'll get out of breath again, you can answer me perfectly well with a gesture, I'll understand. Tell me sincerely, this doesn't bother you? You see, there's a little... I think there's some pollen sprinkled on you; will you let me wipe it off with my hand? I'm not doing it too quickly, I'm not being too rough? Am I tickling you a little, maybe? I don't want to touch the velvet of your dress, I'm afraid I might crush it. But look, it really was necessary to fasten them, they would have fallen; and this way, by pushing them in a little myself... Seriously; I'm not annoying you? And what if I just have a little sniff of them to see if they really have no fragrance? I've never smelled them. May I? Tell the truth. Smiling, she shrugged her shoulders a little, as though to say 'you're quite mad; you can see very well that I like it. He ran his other hand up along Odette's cheek; she gazed at him steadily, with the grave and languid look of the women by the Florentine master whom he had discovered she resembled; protruding to the edges of her lids, her shining eyes, wide and thin, like theirs, seemed about to well out like two tears. She bent her neck as you see them all do, in the pagan scenes as well as in the religious pictures. And in a position that was no doubt habitual for her, which she knew was appropriate to moments like this and which she took care not to forget to adopt, she seemed to require all her strength to hold her face back, as though an invisible force were drawing it towards Swann. And it was Swann who, before she let it fall, as though despite herself, on his lips, held it back for an instant, at a certain distance, between his two hands. He had wanted to give his mind time to catch up, to recognize the dream that it had caressed for so long and to be present at its realization, like a relative summoned to witness the success of a child she has loved very much. Perhaps Swann",3.065424798152636,1.0624291610480494,0.41903666882245777,0.06588911058088218,4.102108768035516,4.0,2.178903488996847,29.06451612903226,21.5,24.37070621750758,1.2358490566037736,1.0,0.5716014027935732,1802,611,0.3390677025527192,7725,62,63.75320564910147,4.87153040010103e+27,2.3488574735299084e+24,0.7870590400988938,0.773574182887872,72.78168594035303,10.328180158247111,9.778596075983211,13.490401346174503,12.423190361963414,7.301975582685902,44.103361856002294,4.370967741935484,True,1207.0,0.8842815814850531,3.7246865959498554,2074.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.021417322834645668,0.014488188976377953,0.014488188976377953,0.010918635170603675,0.010918635170603675,0.010918635170603675,0.008188976377952756,0.005774278215223097,0.0034645669291338585,0.0014464802314368371,53,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"even more beautiful and, bringing Zipporah's photograph close to him, he would believe he was clasping Odette against his heart. And yet he strained his ingenuity not only to prevent Odette from becoming tired of him, but also, sometimes, to prevent himself from becoming tired of her; feeling that, ever since Odette had had every opportunity for seeing him, she did not seem to have much to say to him, he was afraid that the rather banal, monotonous, and more or less permanently predetermined manner she now had when they were together would end by killing the romantic hope he had that one day she would declare her passion, a hope which alone had made him fall in love and stay in love. And in order to work a little reformation in Odette's too fixed mental attitude, which he was afraid would make him grow tired of her, he would suddenly write her a letter full of feigned disappointment and simulated anger that he would send round to her before dinner. He knew that she would be dismayed, and would answer him, and he hoped that in the contraction of her soul caused by the fear of losing him, words would spring forth that she had never yet said to him; and in fact it was by doing this that he had obtained the most tender letters she had yet written to him, including one, which she had sent round to him at noon from La Maison Doree28 (it was the day of the Paris-Murcia fete, held for the flood victims of Murcia),29 that began with these words: 'My dearest, my hand is trembling so badly I can hardly write,' and that he had kept in the same drawer as the dry chrysanthemum flower. Or, if she had not had time to write to him, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come up to him quickly, saying: 'I have to talk to you,' and he would gaze curiously at what he saw in her face and her words that she had until then kept hidden from him, of all that was in her heart. Even as he approached the Verdurins', when he saw the large lamp-lit windows whose shutters were never closed, he was moved as he thought of the charming creature he was going to see in full bloom in their golden light. Now and then the figures of the guests stood out in silhouette, slender and black, screening the lamps, like those little pictures intercalated at intervals around a translucent lampshade whose other panels are plain light. He would try to distinguish Odette's silhouette. Then, as soon as he arrived, without his realizing it, his eyes would shine with such joy that M. Verdurin would say to the painter: 'I think it's getting warm.' And for Swann, Odette's presence did indeed add something to this house which none of the others in which he was entertained possessed: a sort of sensory apparatus, a nervous system ramifying through all the rooms and causing constant excitations in his heart. And so the simple functioning of that social organism, the little 'clan', automatically arranged daily meetings with Odette for Swann and allowed him to feign an indifference to seeing her, or even a desire not to see her, which did not make him run any great risks, since, whatever he wrote to her during the day, he would necessarily see her that evening and take her home. But once when, having glumly contemplated that inevitable ride home together, he had taken his young working girl all the way to the Bois in order to delay the moment of going to the Verdurins', he arrived at their house so late that Odette, thinking he would not be coming, had already left. When he saw that she was no longer in the drawing-room, Swann felt a pain in his heart; he trembled at being deprived of a pleasure that he was now measuring for the first time, having had until then that certainty of finding it when he wanted it which in the case of all pleasures diminishes for us, or even prevents us from perceiving at all, their greatness. Did you notice the look on his face when he saw she wasn't here? said M. Verdurin to his wife, I think one may say he's smitten! The look on his face? asked Doctor Cottard violently since, having gone away for a moment to see a patient and returned to pick up his wife, he did not know whom they were talking about. What, you didn't meet the most handsome of all Swanns at the front door... M. Swann came? Oh, just for a moment. We had a very agitated, a very nervous Swann. You see, Odette had already left. You mean she's on a most intimate footing with him, she has given him the key to her city? asked the doctor, cautiously testing the meaning of the expressions. No, no, there's absolutely nothing going on, and just between us, I think she's making a great mistake and behaving like a real idiot, which she is, in fact. Tut, tut, tut, said M. Verdurin. What do you know about it, how do you know there's nothing going on? We haven't gone there to see for ourselves, have we? She would have told me, retorted Mme Verdurin proudly. I tell you she lets me know about all her little affairs! As she hasn't anyone just now, I told her she ought to sleep with him. She claims she can't, she says she was certainly rather infatuated with him at first, but that he's shy with her, which makes her shy with him, and then anyway she doesn't love him that way, he's some sort of ideal for her, she's afraid of taking the bloom off the feeling she has for him, what do I know? Yet it would be just what she needs. Allow me to disagree with you, said M. Verdurin. I'm not overly fond of the gentleman's looks; I think he's affected. Mme Verdurin froze, assumed an inert expression as if she had turned into a statue, a fiction that allowed it to be assumed that she had not heard that intolerable word 'affected', which seemed to imply that one could 'be affected' with them, therefore that one was 'better than them'. Anyway, if there's nothing going on, I don't think it's because the gentleman thinks she's virtuous, M. Verdurin said ironically. And after all, one can't say anything, since he seems to think she's intelligent. I don't know if you heard what he was declaiming to her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata; I love Odette with all my heart, but to construct aesthetic theories for her benefit, you'd really have to be quite an imbecile! Now, don't say bad things about Odette, said Mme Verdurin, playing the child. She's so charming. But she can still be charming. We aren't saying bad things about her, we're saying she's not a saint, she's not a genius. In fact, he said to the painter, are you really so anxious for her to be virtuous? Who knows perhaps she would be far less charming. On the landing, Swann had been approached by the butler, who had not been there when he arrived and had been instructed by Odette but this was already an hour before to tell him, in case he should still come, that she would probably go and have some chocolate at Prevost's30 before returning home. Swann left for Prevost's, but at every step of the way his carriage was stopped by other carriages or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles that he would gladly have knocked down if the policeman's report would not have delayed him even more than the passing of a pedestrian. He counted the time he was taking, and added a few seconds to all the minutes to be sure of not having made them too short, which would have allowed him to think the chance was greater than it really was that he would arrive early enough and still find Odette. And at one point, like a man in a fever who has just been sleeping and who becomes aware of the absurdity of the dreams he had been contemplating without clearly distinguishing himself from them, Swann suddenly perceived how alien to himself were the thoughts he had been revolving since the moment when he had been told at the Verdurins' that Odette had already left, the new pain he was suffering in his heart, but noted it only as though he had just woken up. What? All this agitation because he would not see Odette till tomorrow, exactly what he had wanted, an hour ago, when he arrived at Mme Verdurin's! He was obliged to acknowledge that in this same carriage which was taking him to Prevost's he was no longer the same, and that he was no longer alone, that a new person was there with him, attached to him, amalgamated to him, one from whom he might not be able to free himself, whom he was going to have to treat with circumspection, like a master or an illness. And yet for a moment now, since he had felt a new person had been added to him in this way, his life had seemed to him more interesting. He hardly said to himself that this possible meeting at Prevost's, however (the expectation of which so disordered, so denuded the moments preceding it that he could no longer find a single idea, a single memory within which he could rest his mind), would probably, if it took place, be like the others, not much of anything. As on every other evening, once he was with Odette, casting on her changing face a furtive glance which he would immediately turn away for fear that she would see in it his mounting desire and no longer believe in his disinterest, he would cease to be able to think about her, too occupied with finding pretexts that would permit him not to leave her right away and to make certain, without seeming to care about it, that he would see her again the next day at the Verdurins': that is, to prolong for the moment and to renew yet one more day the disappointment and torment that came to him from the pointless presence of this woman whom he saw so regularly without daring to take her in his arms. She was not at Prevost's; he wanted to look in every restaurant along the boulevards. In order to gain time, while he visited some he sent into the others his coachman Remi (the Doge Loredano by Rizzo), for whom he then waited having found nothing himself",3.014859718951093,1.152670401766841,0.42455550630140854,0.0781382728742587,4.233499722684415,4.0,2.2150967693505574,31.63157894736842,19.0,29.52348549464543,1.252357182473655,1.0,0.5864893542117442,1803,592,0.3283416528008874,7978,57,60.571671242548774,2.0227517254019843e+26,9.720094788092188e+22,0.7538030018497791,0.7463728896596215,68.77952973114986,11.524130542662814,10.465304597388002,14.738044779169222,14.325573167527807,8.15720465890183,47.32764106605949,4.964912280701754,True,1201.0,0.8875540605478136,3.833733781835656,2081.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012886070771118838,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006545305788504807,0.004295356923706279,0.0052157905502147675,0.010571840461316675,52,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"was also fastening upon this face of an Odette he had not yet possessed, an Odette he had not yet even kissed, this face he was seeing for the last time, the gaze with which, on a day of departure, we hope to carry away with us a landscape we are about to leave for ever. But he was so timid with her that, having ended by possessing her that night, after beginning by arranging her cattleyas, either from dread of offending her, or from fear of appearing in retrospect to have lied, or from a lack of audacity in formulating a greater demand than this one (which he could renew since it had not angered Odette the first time), in the days following he made use of the same pretext. If she had cattleyas tucked in her blouse, he would say: 'It's a pity, this evening the cattleyas don't need to be straightened, they haven't been jostled the way they were the other evening; it seems to me, though, that this one isn't quite straight. May I see if these have more fragrance than the others?' Or, if she had none: 'Oh! No cattleyas tonight, no way for me to indulge in my little rearrangements.' So that, for some time, the order he had followed the first night, when he began by touching Odette's throat with his fingers and lips, was not changed, and his caresses still began this way each time; and much later, when the rearrangement (or the ritual simulacrum of rearrangement) of the cattleyas had long since fallen into disuse, the metaphor 'make cattleya', having become a simple utterance they used without thinking about it when they wanted to signify the act of physical possession in which, in fact, one possesses nothing lived on in their language, commemorating it, after that forgotten custom. And perhaps this individual way of saying 'make love' did not mean exactly the same thing as its synonyms. Even if one is tired of women, even if one believes that the possession of the most various women is always the same and familiar beforehand, this possession becomes a new pleasure if it involves women difficult enough or believed to be so by us so that we have to make it happen as a result of some episode in our relationship with them that is unforeseen, as had been for Swann, the first time, the rearranging of the cattleyas. He tremulously hoped, that night (but Odette, he told himself, if she was fooled by his ruse, would not be able to guess as much), that the possession of this woman was what would emerge from among their broad mauve petals; and the pleasure he felt already and that Odette was perhaps tolerating, he thought, only because she had not recognized it, seemed to him, because of that as it might seem to the first man who tasted it among the flowers of earthly paradise a pleasure that had not existed until then, that he was seeking to create, a pleasure signalled by the special name he gave it entirely individual and new. Now, every evening, when he took her home, he had to go in, and often she came back out in a dressing-gown and led him to his carriage, kissed him within view of the coachman, saying: 'What difference does it make to me, what other people think of me?' On evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened sometimes now that he had another way of seeing her), on the increasingly rare evenings when he went into society, she would ask him to come to see her on his way home, whatever the hour. It was spring, a clear and icy spring. Coming out of a party, he would get into his victoria, spread a rug over his legs, tell the friends who were going off at the same time and who had asked him to join them, that he could not, that he was not going in the same direction, and the coachman would leave at a fast trot knowing where to go. They would be amazed, and, in fact, Swann was not the same. No one ever received a letter from him now asking for an introduction to some woman. He no longer paid any attention to women, avoided going to places where one might meet them. In a restaurant, in the country, his attitude was the opposite of the one by which, just recently, he could be recognized and which had seemed to have been his always. To such an extent does a passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character that replaces our other character and eliminates the signs, invariable until then, by which it was expressed! Now, however, what was invariable was that, wherever Swann might be, he did not fail to go to meet Odette. The path that separated him from her was the one he inevitably travelled as though it were the slope itself, rapid and irresistible, of his life. In truth, when he had stayed out late, he would often have preferred to go directly home without making that long trip, and not see her until the next day; but the very fact of taking the trouble to go to her house at an unusual hour, of guessing that the friends who were leaving him were saying to themselves: 'He is tied hand and foot, some woman must be insisting that he go to her whatever the hour,' made him feel he was leading the life of men known to be having a love affair and in whom the fact that they are sacrificing their sleep and their other interests to a dream of sensuous pleasure produces an inner charm. Then again, without his realizing it, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not somewhere else with other people, that he would not return without seeing her, neutralized the anguish, forgotten but always ready to be reawakened, that he had felt the night when Odette was not at the Verdurins', and of which the present assuagement was so sweet that it could be named happiness. Perhaps it was to this anguish that he owed the fact that Odette had assumed such importance for him. Other people usually leave us so indifferent that when we have invested in one person such possibilities of causing us pain and joy, she seems to belong to another universe, she is surrounded with poetry, she makes our life into a sort of expanse of emotion in which she will be closer to us or less close. Swann could not ask himself without anxiety what Odette would mean to him in the years to come. Now and then, as he saw, from his victoria, on those lovely cold nights, the shining moon spreading its brightness between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, bright and tinged with pink like the moon's, which, one day, had appeared in the forefront of his mind and, since then, had cast on the world the mysterious light in which he saw it. If he arrived after the hour when Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing at the gate of the little garden he would first go into the street on to which looked out, on the ground floor, between the windows, all alike but dark, of the contiguous houses, the only lit one, the window of her bedroom. He would rap at the pane, and she, alerted, would answer and go and wait for him on the other side, at the front door. He would find several of her favourite pieces open on the piano: the Valse des Roses or Pauvre Fou by Tagliafico33 (which should, according to her wishes which she had put into writing, be performed at her funeral), he would ask her to play instead the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata, even though Odette played very badly, but the loveliest vision of a work of art that stays with us is often the one that transcended the wrong notes coaxed by unskilful fingers from an out-of-tune piano. For Swann the little phrase continued to be associated with the love he felt for Odette. He was aware that this love was something that did not correspond to anything external, anything verifiable by others besides him; he realized that Odette's qualities did not justify his attaching so much value to the time he spent with her. And often, when his positive intelligence alone prevailed in Swann, he wanted to stop sacrificing so many intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But as soon as he heard it, the little phrase had the power to open up within him the space it needed, the proportions of Swann's soul were changed by it; a margin was reserved in him for a bliss that also did not correspond to any external object, and yet, instead of being purely individual, like the enjoyment of that love, assumed for Swann a reality superior to that of concrete things. The little phrase incited in him this thirst for an unfamiliar delight, but it did not give him anything precise to assuage it. So that those parts of Swann's soul from which the little phrase had erased any concern for material interests, any considerations that were human and valid for all people, it had left vacant and blank, and in them he was free to write Odette's name. Also, to what Odette's affection might have about it that was somewhat limited and disappointing, the little phrase came along to add, to amalgamate its mysterious essence. From the sight of Swann's face as he listened to the phrase, one would have said he was absorbing an anaesthetic that allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, and which was soon to create in him a true need, did indeed resemble, at those moments, the pleasure he would have found in testing fragrances, in entering into contact with a world for which we are not made, which seems formless to us because our eyes do not perceive it, meaningless because it evades our understanding, which we can attain only through a single sense. What great repose, what mysterious renewal for Swann for him whose eyes, though refined lovers of painting, whose mind, though a shrewd observer of manners, bore forever the indelible trace of the dryness of his life to feel himself transformed into a creature strange to humanity, blind, without logical faculties, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimerical creature perceiving the world only through his hearing. And since he still searched the little phrase for a meaning to which his understanding could not descend, what strange",3.719002624926272,1.1783840591916392,0.4241479315002333,0.05862257873068659,4.365853658536586,4.0,2.32771508795441,44.0,34.0,29.631064780058107,1.289911308203991,1.0,0.653905368995862,1804,639,0.35421286031042126,8141,41,63.47359376399655,3.6832527202726104e+27,1.7940831564893378e+24,0.8638371244072914,0.8500467745157388,53.04850332594238,16.790953436807097,13.023866798666859,20.327272727272728,21.133170731707317,9.19849223946785,61.572062084257205,7.7317073170731705,True,1172.0,0.885046273745738,3.9654164637116414,2053.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004828488079670053,0.004828488079670053,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0065385776078865305,0.010260537169298863,0.0,0.0063321967851924016,54,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"drunkenness he felt, as he divested his innermost soul of all the help of reason and forced it to pass alone through the sieve, through the dark filter of sound! He began to become aware of all that was painful, perhaps even secretly unappeased in the depths of the sweetness of that phrase, but it could not hurt him. What did it matter if it told him love was fragile, his own love was so strong! He toyed with the sadness it diffused, he felt it pass over him, but in a caress that only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He made Odette play it ten times, twenty times, demanding that while she did so she should not stop kissing him. Each kiss summons another kiss. Ah, in those first days of love, kisses come so naturally! So closely, in their profusion, do they crowd together; and it would be as hard for you to count the kisses you give each other in an hour as the flowers of a field in the month of May. Then she would make as if to stop, saying: 'How can you expect me to play like that if you hold on to me? I can't do everything at once. Now decide what you want should I play the piano or play with you?', he would become annoyed, she would burst out laughing, and her laughter would change and descend on him in a rain of kisses. Or she would look at him with a sullen expression, once again he would see before him a face worthy of appearing in Botticelli's Life of Moses, he would place her in it, he would give Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had well and truly painted her in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, the idea that she had nevertheless remained here, by the piano, in the present moment, ready to be kissed and possessed, the idea of her materiality and her life would intoxicate him with such force that, his eye distracted, his jaw tensed as though to devour her, he would swoop down upon that Botticelli virgin and begin pinching her cheeks. Then, once he had left her, not without going back in to kiss her again because he had forgotten to carry away in his memory some detail of her smell or her features, while he was returning home in his victoria, he would bless Odette for allowing him these daily visits, which he felt could not give her very great joy, but which, by saving him from becoming jealous by relieving him of the occasion for suffering again from the disease that had broken out in him on the evening when he had not found her at the Verdurins' would help him to arrive, without having any more of those crises of which the first had been so painful and would remain the only one, at the end of this singular period of his life, these hours that were almost enchanted, like those in which he crossed Paris in the light of the moon. And, noticing, during his return, that the star had now moved in relation to him and was almost at the edge of the horizon, feeling that his love, too, was obeying immutable and natural laws, he asked himself whether this period he had entered would last much longer, whether, soon, his thoughts would no longer see the dear face except as occupying a distant and diminished place, and nearly ceasing to radiate any charm. For Swann did find charm in things, now that he was in love, just as in the time when, as an adolescent, he had thought he was an artist; but this was no longer the same charm; Odette alone conferred it on them. He felt the inspirations of his youth, which had been dissipated by a frivolous life, reawakening in him, but they all bore the reflection, the mark of a particular being; and, in the long hours which he now found a delicate pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescing soul, little by little he became himself again, but for another. He went to her house only in the evening, and he knew nothing about how she spent her time during the day, any more than about her past, so much so that he lacked even that initial bit of information which, by allowing us to imagine for ourselves what we do not know, makes us want to know it. Thus, he did not ask himself what she might be doing, nor what sort of life she had had. He merely smiled sometimes at the thought that a few years before, when he did not know her, someone had talked to him about a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been she, as being a courtesan, a kept woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed, since he had spent very little time in their company, the wilful, fundamentally perverse character with which they were for so long endowed by the imaginations of certain novelists. He would tell himself that often if one simply believes the opposite of the reputation the world has formed one will judge a person accurately, when he contrasted the character of such a woman with that of Odette, good, naive, enamoured of idealism, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, after he begged her one day, so that he could have dinner alone with her, to write to the Verdurins telling them that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme Verdurin, who was asking her if she felt better, blush, stammer and reveal on her face despite herself what an affliction, what a torment it was for her to lie, and, while in her answer she multiplied the invented details of her alleged indisposition the day before, appear to be asking forgiveness, by her supplicating looks and her sorrowful voice, for the falseness of her words. On certain days, however, though they were rare, she came to his home in the afternoon, interrupting his day-dreams or the study of Vermeer he had resumed lately. His servant would come to tell him that Mme de Crecy was in his morning-room. He would go off to find her there, and when he opened the door, as soon as she saw Swann, a smile would come and settle in Odette's rosy face, changing the shape of her mouth, the look in her eyes, the modelling of her cheeks. When he was alone again, he would see that smile, he would see the one she had given him the day before, another with which she had greeted him on some occasion or other, the one with which she had responded, in the carriage, when he had asked her if it annoyed her that he was straightening her cattleyas; and Odette's life during the rest of the time, since he knew nothing about it, appeared to him, with its neutral and colourless background, similar to those pages of studies by Watteau34 in which one sees, here, there, in every corner, from every angle, drawn in three colours on buff paper, innumerable smiles. But sometimes, in a corner of that life which Swann saw as completely empty, even if his mind told him it was not, because he could not imagine it, some friend, who, suspecting they loved each other, would not have ventured to tell him anything about her except what was insignificant, would describe to him Odette's form, which he had seen, that very morning, going up the rue Abbatucci35 on foot in a 'visiting cloak' trimmed with skunk, under a 'Rembrandt-style' hat and with a bouquet of violets at her blouse. This simple sketch was greatly disturbing to Swann because it suddenly made him see that Odette had a life which did not belong entirely to him; he wanted to know whom she had been trying to please with that outfit, which he did not know she possessed; he would promise himself to ask her where she had been going, at that moment, as if in the whole of his mistress's colourless life almost inexistent, because it was invisible to him there had been only one thing apart from all those smiles directed at him: her walking under a Rembrandt-style hat, with a bunch of violets in her bodice. Except when he asked her for the little phrase by Vinteuil instead of The Waltz of the Roses, Swann did not try to make her play things he liked or, any more in music than in literature, to correct her bad taste. He fully realized that she was not intelligent. When she told him she would like it so much if he would tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would immediately become familiar with heroic and romantic couplets like those by the Vicomte de Borelli,36 but even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked if he had ever suffered because of a woman, if it was a woman who had inspired him, and when Swann admitted to her that no one knew anything about that, she lost interest in the painter. She often said: 'I do believe, of course, that poetry well, there would be nothing more beautiful if it was true, if poets really believed everything they said. But quite often, those people are the most calculating of all. I know something about it, because a friend of mine was in love with a poet of sorts. In his poetry all he talked about was love, the sky, the stars. Oh, she was fooled all right! He did her out of more than three hundred thousand francs.' If Swann then tried to teach her what artistic beauty was, how one should admire poetry or painting, after a moment she would stop listening, saying: 'Yes... I didn't imagine it was like that.' And he would sense that she was feeling such disappointment that he would prefer to lie, telling her that what he had said was nothing, that it was only the least important part, that he did not have the time to go into things more deeply, that there was something else. But she would say to him sharply: 'Something else? What?... Say it, then,' but he would not say it, knowing how it would seem feeble to her and different from what she was hoping for, less sensational and less touching, and fearing that, disillusioned by art, she would at the same time be disillusioned by love. And in fact she found Swann intellectually inferior to what she would have thought.

"I can't make you out.' She would marvel more at his indifference to money, his kindness to everyone, his refinement. And it often happens, in fact, to greater men than Swann, to a scientist or an artist, when he is not misunderstood by those around him, that the feeling on their part which proves that the superiority of his intelligence has compelled their recognition is not their admiration for his ideas, since these are beyond them, but their respect for his goodness. Respect, too, was what was inspired in Odette by Swann's position in society, but she did not want him to try to secure invitations for her. Perhaps she felt that he might not be successful, or was even afraid that merely by talking about her he would prompt revelations that she dreaded. In any case, she had made him promise never to utter her name. The reason she did not want to go into society, she had told him, was a quarrel she had once had with a friend who, to avenge herself, had then said bad things about her. Swann objected: 'But not everyone knew your friend. Well, yes, but these things get around. The world is cruel.' Swann did not understand this story, but on the other hand he knew that such precepts 'The world is cruel,' 'a slanderous remark spreads like a drop of oil' were generally held to be true; there must be cases to which they applied. Was Odette's one of them? He wondered about this, but not for long, because he too was subject to the mental torpor that had burdened his father, whenever he posed himself a difficult problem. Besides, this world which so frightened Odette did not, perhaps, inspire any great desire in her, because it was too far removed from the one she knew for her to picture it quite clearly to herself. However, while she had remained in certain respects truly simple (for example she had kept as her friend a solitary little seamstress, whose steep, dark and foul-smelling stair she climbed almost every day), she thirsted after fashion, but did not conceive of it in the same way as the fashionable people. For them, fashion is a thing that emanates from a small number of individuals who project it to a considerable distance more and more faintly the farther one is from the centre of their closest associations through the circle of their friends or the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of register. Society people hold this register in their memory, they have an erudition about such matters, from which they have derived a sort of taste, a sort of discernment, so that if Swann, for example, read in a newspaper the names of the people who were at a dinner, he could immediately, without having to call upon his knowledge of the world, tell the exact degree of stylishness of that dinner, the way a literary person, simply by reading a sentence, can judge exactly the quality of its author. But Odette was one of those people (extremely numerous, whatever the fashionable people may think, and the like of which exists in every class of society) who do not share these notions, who imagine a stylishness that is quite different, that assumes different guises according to the circle to which they belong, but has the particular characteristic whether it be the sort of stylishness Odette dreamed of, or the sort Mme Cottard worshipped of being directly accessible to everyone. The other, the stylishness of the society people, is accessible too, in truth, but only after some lapse of time. Odette would say of someone: He only goes to the really smart places. And if Swann asked her what she meant by that, she would answer him a little scornfully: Why, smart places! My goodness! If at your age you need to be taught what the smart places are, I don't know what to tell you. For example, the avenue de l'Imperatrice37 on Sunday mornings, the Tour du Lac38 at five o'clock, the e den Theatre39 on Thursdays, the Hippodrome40 on Friday, the balls... Now, what balls? Why, the balls people give in Paris, the smart ones, I mean. Well, Herbinger, you know, the one that has a job with a broker? But you must know him, he's one of the most successful men in Paris, that tall blond young man who's such a snob, who always has a flower in his buttonhole, a part at the back, a light-coloured overcoat; he goes about with that old bag he takes out to all the premieres. Well, he gave a ball the other night, and the smartest people in Paris were there. How I would have loved to go! But you had to show your invitation card at the door and I couldn't get one. Really, I'm just as glad I didn't go, I would have got killed in the crush, and I wouldn't have seen a thing. It's really just to be able to say you were at Herbinger's. And you know what a braggart I am! Anyway, you can bet that out of a hundred girls who tell you they were there, a good half of them are lying... But actually, you're such a swell, I'm amazed you weren't there. But Swann in no way tried to make her change this conception of fashionable life; thinking that his own was no more real, was also foolish, unimportant, he saw no point in instructing her about it, so that after some months she had no interest in the people whose homes he went to except as a means of obtaining enclosure passes for horse-races or tickets to premieres. She wanted him to cultivate useful relationships of that kind, but in other respects she was persuaded they were not very smart, after she saw the Marquise de Villeparisis go past her in the street wearing a black woollen dress and a bonnet with strings. Why, she looks like a working-class woman, darling, like an old concierge! That was a marquise! I'm no marquise, but you'd have to pay me handsomely to make me go about rigged out like that! She could not understand why Swann lived in the house on the quai d'Orleans which, though she did not dare admit it to him, she found unworthy of him. Of course she claimed she loved 'antiques' and assumed a rapturous and discriminating air when she said she adored spending a whole day 'collecting curios', looking for 'bric-a-brac', things 'from the past'. Although it was a sort of point of honour in which she persisted (and in which she seemed to be obeying some family precept) that she should never answer questions or 'account' for how she spent her days, she talked to Swann once about a friend who had invited her to her house, where everything was 'period'. But Swann could not manage to make her say what that period was. After some reflection, however, she answered that it was 'medieval'. By this she meant that there was wood panelling. Some time later, she talked to him about her friend again and added, in the hesitant tone and with the knowing look with which you mention someone you have had dinner with the night before and whose name you never heard before, but whom your hosts seemed to consider someone so celebrated that you hope the person you are talking to will know who you are talking about: 'Her dining-room... is... eighteenth-century!' She had thought the room was hideous, bare, as if the house were not finished, the women looked hideous in it too and the fashion would never catch on. Finally, she talked about this again a third time and showed Swann the address of the man who had made that dining-room and whom she wanted to send for, when she had the money, to see if he could make one for her, not the same one, of course, but another which she was contemplating and which unfortunately the dimensions of her little house would not allow, one with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the ones in the Chateau de Blois.41 That day, she let slip in Swann's presence what she thought of his home on the quai d'Orleans; because he had criticized the fact that Odette's friend preferred, not Louis XVI, for, he said, even though that was not done, it could be charming, but the fake antique: 'You wouldn't want her to live the way you do, with your broken furniture and your threadbare carpets,' she said to him, her bourgeois deference to public opinion prevailing, again, over her cocotte dilettantism. People who liked collecting curios, who liked poetry, who were contemptuous of crass calculations, and dreamed of honour and love, she saw as an elite superior to the rest of humanity. One did not really have to have these predilections, provided one proclaimed them; of a man who had confessed to her at dinner that he loved to wander about the city, to get his hands dirty in the old shops, that he would never be appreciated by this commercial century, because he did not look after his own interests, and that because of this he belonged to another age, she returned home saying: 'Why, he's adorable, so sensitive, I never would have guessed!' and she felt a sudden warm friendship for him. But on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes, but did not talk about them, left her cold. No doubt she had to admit that Swann did not value money, but she would add sulkily: 'But with him, it's not the same thing'; and in fact, what spoke to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary. Realizing that he often failed to satisfy her dreams, he at least tried to see that she enjoyed being with him, not to oppose the vulgar ideas, the bad taste, which she displayed in all things, and which he loved, moreover, like everything else that emanated from her, which even enchanted him, for they were so many particular traits by which the woman's essence appeared to him, became visible. And so, when she looked happy because she was going to La Reine Topaz,42 or when her gaze became serious, worried and petulant, because she was afraid of missing the flower show or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast,43 at the 'The de la rue Royale',44 regular attendance at which she believed was indispensable in establishing a woman's reputation for elegance, Swann, enchanted as we are by the naturalness of a child or the truthfulness of a portrait that seems about to speak, sensed so clearly his mistress's soul",3.155131450623369,1.1321891973865241,0.41938780411316406,0.08284948564286887,4.3434903047091415,4.0,2.3268915709310543,31.120689655172413,21.0,29.721742642908275,1.2642659279778394,1.0,0.6284770989529764,1805,633,0.3506925207756233,8242,58,65.55933803630452,2.9652324651764326e+28,1.398035108522599e+25,0.7463481831446028,0.7447832567351205,68.2906024930748,11.465406915655745,10.852061532183505,14.797306332983093,14.588184162766261,8.788587257617728,47.74118827013086,5.172413793103448,True,1161.0,0.8651579443658651,3.885902876001886,2121.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007966540529774946,0.0035849432383987254,0.0,0.006600660066006601,56,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"rising to the surface of her face that he could not resist going over to touch it with his lips. 'Ah! She wants to be taken to the flower show, little Odette, she wants to be admired, well then, we'll take her, we must obey.' Since Swann's vision was rather poor, he had resigned himself to wearing glasses for working at home, and to adopting, for going out in the world, a monocle, which was less disfiguring. The first time she saw him with one in his eye, she could not contain her joy: 'I really do think for a man it's very smart! How it suits you! You look like a real gentleman. All you're missing is a title!' she added, with a touch of regret. He was happy that Odette was like this, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton woman, he would have enjoyed seeing her in a coiffe and hearing her tell him she believed in ghosts. Until then, as is true of many men whose taste for the arts develops independently from their sensuality, a bizarre disparity had existed between the satisfactions he conceded to one and those he conceded to the other, as he enjoyed, in the company of increasingly crude women, the seductions of increasingly refined works of art, taking a little housemaid to a closed orchestra box for the performance of a decadent play that he wanted to see or to an exhibition of Impressionist painting, and sure, in any case, that a cultivated woman of the world would not have understood any more about it, but would not have been able to keep quiet so nicely. But now that he loved Odette, to feel what she felt, to try to have but a single soul for the two of them, was so sweet to him that he tried to enjoy the things she liked, and his pleasure, not only in imitating her habits, but in adopting her opinions, was all the more profound because, since they had no roots in his own intelligence, they reminded him only of his love, because of which he preferred them. If he went to more than one performance of Serge Panine,45 if he sought out opportunities to go to see Olivier Metra46 conduct, it was for the sweetness of being initiated into all of Odette's ideas, of feeling he was sharing equally in all her tastes. This charm of bringing him close to her, which was possessed by the works or the places that she liked, seemed to him more mysterious than the charm intrinsic in those that were lovelier but did not remind him of her. What was more, because he had allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to weaken, and because his scepticism as a man of the world had, unbeknownst to him, penetrated to them, he thought (or at least he had thought this for so long that he still said it) that the objects of our preferences do not have an absolute value in themselves, but that they all depend on one's period, one's social class, they are all merely fashions, the most vulgar of which are equal to those that pass for the most distinguished. And just as he believed that the importance Odette attached to having cards for the opening was not in itself a more ridiculous thing than the pleasure he used to take in lunching at the home of the Prince of Wales, likewise he did not think that the admiration she professed for Monte Carlo or for the Righi47 was more unreasonable than the fondness he himself felt for Holland, which she imagined to be ugly, or for Versailles, which she found dreary. And so he denied himself those places, pleased to tell himself that it was for her sake, that he wanted to feel things, love things, only with her. Like everything else that was part of Odette's environment and no more, in some sense, than a means by which he could see her, talk to her, he enjoyed the company of the Verdurins. There, because at the centre of all the amusements, meals, music, games, costumed suppers, excursions into the country, theatre parties, even the rare 'grand soirees' given for the 'bores', was the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, of which the Verdurins gave to Swann, by inviting him, the inestimable gift, he was happier among the 'little clan' than anywhere else, and sought to attribute real merits to it, for by so doing he could imagine that, out of preference, he would associate with it all his life. For, since he did not dare to say to himself, afraid that he would not believe it, that he would always love Odette, at least by supposing that he would always associate with the Verdurins (a proposition that, a priori, raised fewer objections of principle on the part of his intelligence), he could see himself in the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; this did not perhaps quite amount to the same thing as always loving her, but for the moment, while he loved her, to believe that he would not stop seeing her one day was all that he asked. 'What a charming place, he would say to himself. How fundamentally real their life is! How much more intelligent, more artistic, they are there than high-society people! How sincere, despite some rather absurd little exaggerations, is Mme Verdurin's love of painting, music what a passion she has for works of art, and how she longs to please artists! The notion she has formed of society people is not accurate; but then again, society's notion of artistic circles is even more false! Perhaps I make no very great intellectual demands in conversation, but I'm perfectly happy with Cottard though he does make inept puns. And as for the painter, his pretentiousness may be unpleasant when he's trying to surprise people, but on the other hand he has one of the finest minds I've ever known. And also, most of all, you feel free there, you do what you like without feeling constrained, without standing on ceremony. What a quantity of good humour is expended every day in that drawing-room! Decidedly, apart from a few rare exceptions, I will never go anywhere else. More and more, that is where I will find my companionship and live my life.' And since the qualities that he believed to be intrinsic to the Verdurins were merely the reflection of the pleasures he enjoyed in their house because of his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, along with those pleasures. Because Mme Verdurin sometimes gave Swann the only thing that could constitute happiness for him; because, on a certain evening when he felt anxious because Odette had been talking to one guest more than another, and when, irritated at her, he did not want to take the initiative of asking her if she would return home with him, Mme Verdurin brought him peace and joy by saying spontaneously: 'Odette, you will take M. Swann home, won't you?'; because, when summer was approaching, and he had at first wondered uneasily if Odette would be going away without him, if he could continue to see her every day, Mme Verdurin invited them both to spend it at her home in the country Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to infiltrate into his intelligence and influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme Verdurin was the soul of high-mindedness. Apropos of a few delightful or eminent people whom one of his old classmates from the e cole du Louvre might mention to him, he would respond: 'I prefer the Verdurins a hundred times over.' And, with a solemnity that was new to him: 'They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, fundamentally, the only thing that matters and that gives us distinction here on earth. You know, there are only two classes of people: the magnanimous ones and all the rest; and when you reach my age you have to choose, you have to decide once and for all whom you intend to like and whom you intend to despise, stick with the ones you like and, so as to make up for the time you've wasted with the others, not leave them again until you die. Well!' he added with that slight emotion you feel when, even without fully realizing it, you say something not because it is true, but because you enjoy saying it and you listen to it in your own voice as if it came from somewhere other than from yourself, 'the die is cast, I have chosen to like only magnanimous hearts and to live from now on only in magnanimity. You ask me if Mme Verdurin is truly intelligent. I assure you that she has given me proof of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul which, you know, can't be attained without an equal loftiness of mind. Certainly she has a profound intelligence where the arts are concerned. But perhaps this is not her most admirable quality; and a small action, an ingeniously, exquisitely good one, that she has performed for me, a genial attention, a familiarly sublime gesture, reveal a more profound understanding of life than any philosophical treatise.' Yet he could have said to himself that there were old friends of his parents just as simple as the Verdurins, friends of his youth as smitten with art, that he knew other great-hearted people, and that nevertheless, now that he had opted for simplicity, the arts and magnanimity, he never saw them any more. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of bringing the two of them together. And so doubtless there was not, in the whole Verdurin circle, a single faithful partisan who liked them or thought he liked them as much as Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin had said he did not much care for Swann, he was not only expressing his own thoughts, but also guessing his wife's. Doubtless Swann's affection for Odette was too private and he had neglected to make Mme Verdurin his daily confidante concerning it; doubtless the very discretion with which he had made use of the Verdurins' hospitality, often refraining from coming to dinner for a reason that they did not suspect and in place of which they saw a desire not to turn down an invitation to the home of some 'bores', doubtless, too, and despite all the precautions he had taken to hide it from them, their gradual discovery of his brilliant position in society, all fed their irritation with him. But the deeper",3.4074207209478136,1.3708896953596101,0.4332367880995153,0.07550385192288558,4.383720930232558,4.0,2.4239348901731894,37.625,27.5,33.77846022245537,1.315060908084164,1.0,0.6987294050279987,1806,612,0.3388704318936877,8219,48,65.23063075054978,2.134533553537794e+28,1.0242483462273485e+25,0.7670819531888404,0.7664599386904307,57.39147217607973,14.601468715393136,13.023866798666859,18.23936877076412,18.02982558139535,9.18956810631229,55.84205426356589,6.854166666666667,True,1173.0,0.8752399232245681,3.9438579654510555,2084.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009781415310909272,0.00399241441261603,0.0,0.010076775431861805,57,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"reason for it was different. It was that they had very quickly sensed in him a reserved, impenetrable space, where he continued to profess silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque and that Cottard's jokes were not funny, in the end, and, even though he never deviated from his affability and never rebelled against their dogmas, an impossibility of imposing them on him, of wholly converting him to them, the like of which they had never encountered before in anyone. They would have forgiven him for associating with bores (to whom, for that matter, in his heart of hearts, he preferred the Verdurins and the whole of the little clan a thousand times over), if he had consented, as a good example, to renounce them in the presence of the faithful. But this was an abjuration they understood could not be wrung from him. How different from a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them to invite, though she had not met him more a few times, and in whom they invested many hopes: the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that in fact he was Saniette's brother-in-law, which filled the faithful with surprise: the old archivist's manners were so humble that they had always thought he was from a social rank inferior to theirs and did not expect to learn that he belonged to a world that was rich and relatively aristocratic.) True, Forcheville was grossly snobbish, whereas Swann was not; true, he did not even dream of placing the circle of the Verdurins above all others, as Swann did. But he did not have the natural delicacy that stopped Swann from joining in with the too manifestly false criticisms that Mme Verdurin leveled against people he knew. As for the vulgar and pretentious tirades the painter launched into on certain days, and as for the travelling-salesman jokes that Cottard ventured, for which Swann, who liked both men, could easily find excuses without having the heart or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville by contrast was of an intellectual calibre that allowed him to be dumbfounded, awestruck by the first, though he did not understand them, and to delight in the second. And in fact the first dinner at the Verdurins' at which Forcheville was present exposed all these differences, brought out his qualities and precipitated Swann's fall from grace. At this dinner there was, besides the regulars, a professor from the Sorbonne, Brichot, who had met M. and Mme Verdurin at the spa and, if his duties at the university and his scholarly work had not given him very few hours of freedom, would willingly have come to their house often. For he had that curiosity, that excessive interest in life which, when combined with a degree of scepticism concerning the object of their studies, gives certain intelligent men in any profession, doctors who do not believe in medicine, schoolteachers who do not believe in Latin compositions, a reputation for having minds that are broad, brilliant and even superior. At Mme Verdurin's, he made a point of seeking his illustrations in whatever was most up-to-date when he spoke of philosophy and history, principally because he thought such subjects were only a preparation for real life and he imagined he would find put into practice by the little clan what he had known before now only from books, and then perhaps also because, having had instilled in him in the past, and having preserved without knowing it, a respect for certain subjects, he believed he was casting off his academic tendencies by taking liberties with them which, on the contrary, appeared such to him only because he had remained an academic. At the very beginning of the meal, when M. de Forcheville, placed to the right of Mme Verdurin, who had gone to great trouble over her appearance so as to please the 'newcomer', said to her: 'Quite original, that white dress,' the doctor, who had been steadily observing him, so curious was he to find out what sort of man a 'de', as he termed it, would be, and who was looking for a chance of attracting his attention and entering into closer contact with him, seized on the word 'blanche' and, without lifting his nose from his plate, said: 'blanche? Blanche de Castille?',48 then, without moving his head, cast his eyes furtively to the right and left with an uncertain, smiling look. Whereas Swann, with his painful and useless attempt at a smile, revealed how stupid he thought the pun was, Forcheville had shown both that he relished its subtlety and that he had good manners, by containing within judicious limits a gaiety whose frankness had charmed Mme Verdurin. What do you make of our man of science? she had asked Forcheville. It's impossible to have even two minutes of serious conversation with him. Is that the sort of thing you say to them at your hospital?' she had added, turning to the doctor. 'It must be rather lively there, if that's the case. I see I'll have to get them to admit me as a patient. I think I heard the doctor talking about that old termagant, Blanche de Castille, if I dare express myself that way. Am I correct, Madame? Brichot asked Mme Verdurin, who, swooning with laughter, her eyes shut, plunged her face into her hands, from which stifled cries escaped. My God, Madame, I wouldn't want to alarm whatever respectful souls there may be at this table, sub rosa... And I realize that our ineffable republic, Athenian as it is how very much so! might pay homage to that obscurantist Capetian lady as the first police prefect with any energy at all. Yes indeed, my dear host, yes indeed, yes indeed, he went on in his sonorous voice, detaching each syllable, in response to an objection of M. Verdurin's. The Chronique de Saint-Denis, whose facts are incontestably reliable, leaves no doubt about this. No better choice of patron could have been made by a secularized proletariat than that mother of a saint to whom, incidentally, she gave a pretty rough time, as we are told by Suger and other Saint Bernards;49 for with her everyone got hauled over the coals. Who is this gentleman? Forcheville asked Mme Verdurin. He seems first-rate. What? You haven't heard of the famous Brichot? Why, he's celebrated all over Europe. So that's Brechot! cried Forcheville, who had not heard the name clearly. You must tell me all about him, he added, staring wide-eyed at the famous man. It's always interesting to have dinner with a prominent person. But I must say, you certainly give your guests some choice dinner-mates. No one's likely to get bored in your house. Oh, you know, the most important thing, Mme Verdurin said modestly, is that they know they can trust us. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation is off and running. For instance, now, take Brichot. This is nothing: I've seen him, you know, when he's been absolutely dazzling here in my house, you feel you ought to go down on your knees in front of him. Well, now, at other people's houses, he's not the same man, he hasn't a scrap of wit, you have to force the words out of him, he's actually boring. How odd! said Forcheville, surprised. A wit like Brichot's would have been considered pure stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his youth, even though it might be compatible with real intelligence. And the professor's intelligence, vigorous and well nourished, probably would have been envied by many of the society people whom Swann considered witty. But those people had inculcated him so thoroughly with their own likes and dislikes, at least concerning anything to do with society life, including even that annexed part of it which should, instead, belong to the domain of intelligence namely, conversation that Swann could only find Brichot's jokes pedantic, vulgar and sickeningly coarse. Then, too, being so accustomed to good manners, he was shocked by the rough military tone affected, each time he addressed anyone, by the jingoistic academic. Finally, perhaps he had lost some of his indulgence that evening in particular, seeing the friendliness Mme Verdurin displayed towards this man Forcheville whom Odette had had the singular idea of bringing. A little ill at ease with Swann, she had asked him when she arrived: What do you think of my guest? And he, realizing for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for a long time, might be attractive to a woman and was a rather handsome man, had answered: 'Disgusting!' Of course, it did not occur to him to be jealous of Odette, but he did not feel as happy as usual and when Brichot, having begun to tell the story of Blanche de Castille's mother, who 'had been with Henry Plantagenet50 for years before she married him', tried to prompt Swann to ask him what happened next by saying to him: 'Isn't that so, Monsieur Swann?' in the martial tone one adopts to make oneself understood by a peasant or instil courage in a soldier, Swann spoiled Brichot's effect, to the fury of their hostess, by answering that they must please excuse him for being so uninterested in Blanche de Castille, but he had something to ask the painter. That afternoon, in fact, the latter had gone to see the show of a friend of Mme Verdurin's, an artist who had died recently, and Swann wanted to find out from him (for he respected his taste) if there really was even more in these last works than the virtuosity that was already so astounding in the earlier ones. In that respect it was extraordinary, but it didn't seem to me to be an art that was, as they say, all that 'elevated', said Swann, smiling. Elevated... to the height of an institution, interrupted Cottard, lifting his arms with mock gravity. The whole table burst out laughing. Didn't I tell you? He won't allow anyone to be serious, said Mme Verdurin to Forcheville. Just when you least expect it, he comes out with a pun. But she noticed that Swann alone had not brightened up. What was more, he was not very pleased that Cottard had made fun of him in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of answering Swann in an interesting way, which he probably would have done if he had been alone with him, preferred to win the admiration of the guests by contributing a little set piece on the skill of the deceased master. I went up to one of them, he said, just to see how it was done. I stuck my nose into it. Well! Gospel truth!

"was done with glue, or rubies, or soap, or sunshine, or leaven, or bronze, or caca! And one makes twelve, cried the doctor, too late, so that no one understood his interruption. The thing looked as though it were made with nothing at all, the painter went on; absolutely no way of discovering the trick, any more than in La Ronde de Nuit or Les Regentes, and the brushwork is even stronger than Rembrandt or Hals.51 It's got everything in it no, I swear. And just as singers who have reached the highest note they can sing continue in falsetto, softly, he confined himself to murmuring, and smiling, as if in fact the painting had been absurdly beautiful: It smells good, it goes to your head, it takes your breath away, it tickles you, and you haven't a hope of knowing what it's made with, it's some kind of sorcery, it's a trick, it's a miracle (bursting fully into laughter): it's dishonest!' And stopping, gravely lifting his head, adopting a deep bass note which he tried to make harmonious, he added: 'and it's so loyal!' Except at the moment when he had said: 'stronger than La Ronde de Nuit', a blasphemy that had provoked a protest from Mme Verdurin, who considered La Ronde de Nuit the greatest masterpiece in the world along with the Ninth and the Winged Victory,52 and at 'made with caca', which had caused Forcheville to cast a circular glance at the table to see if the word was acceptable and had then brought to his mouth a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the guests except for Swann had fastened their eyes on the painter with gazes hypnotized by admiration. How he amuses me when he gets carried away like that, cried Mme Verdurin when he was finished, delighted that the table was so interesting on the very day when M. de Forcheville had come for the first time. And what about you, what's the matter with you, letting your mouth hang open that way like some great dog? she said to her husband. You know very well how he can talk; it's as if my husband had never heard you before. If only you could have seen the way he looked while you were talking, he was drinking you in. And tomorrow he'll repeat everything you said without losing a word. But it's no joke, said the painter, enchanted with his success, you seem to think I'm giving you a sales-talk, you think it's all a sham; I'll take you there to see for yourself, then you'll decide whether I'm exaggerating. I'll bet your boots you'll come back even more enthusiastic than I was! But we don't think you're exaggerating, we just want you to eat your dinner, and we want my husband to eat too; give Monsieur some more sole normande, you can see that his is cold. We're not in such a hurry as all that, you're serving as if the house were on fire, now wait a little before you bring in the salad. Mme Cottard, who was modest and did not talk much, did not lack self-assurance when a happy inspiration caused her to hit upon a suitable remark. She felt that it would have some success, this gave her confidence, and what she did with it was not so much in order to shine as to be useful to her husband's career. And so she did not allow the word 'salad' to escape after it was spoken by Mme Verdurin. That wouldn't be Japanese salad, would it? she said softly, turning to Odette. And delighted and abashed by the appropriateness and boldness of making this allusion, so discreet, yet so clear, to Dumas's astonishing new play,53 she burst into the charming laughter of a naif, not very noisy, but so irresistible that for a few moments she could not control it. 'Who is that lady? She's a lively one,' said Forcheville. No, it's not, but we'll have some for you if you'll all come to dine with us on Friday. I'm going to seem very provincial to you, Monsieur, said Mme Cottard to Swann, but I haven't yet seen the famous Francillon everyone's talking about. The doctor has already gone (I even recall that he told me he had the very great pleasure of spending the evening with you) and I confess that I didn't find it quite reasonable that he should pay for seats to go again with me. Obviously, at the Theatre-Francais, one never regrets one's evening, it's always well acted, but as we have very nice friends (Mme Cottard rarely uttered a proper name and simply referred to 'some friends of ours' or 'one of my friends', because it was more 'distinguished', speaking in an artificial tone and with the air of importance of a person who names only those she chooses to) who often have a box and are kind enough to take us to all the new productions that are worth going to, I'm certain to see Francillon sooner or later, and then I can form an opinion for myself. Yet I must confess I find I'm a bit embarrassed, for in every drawing-room I visit, naturally the only thing they're talking about is that wretched Japanese salad. One even begins to be a little tired of it, she added, seeing that Swann did not seem as interested as she would have thought in so burning a current event. I must admit, though, that it sometimes provides an excuse for some rather amusing notions. For instance, I have a friend who's most original, though she's a very pretty woman, very popular, very sought-after, who claims she got her cook to make that Japanese salad at her house, putting in everything that Alexandre Dumas fils says to in the play. She invited some friends to come and eat it. Unfortunately I wasn't one of the elect. But she told us about it at her next 'at-home'; apparently it was quite horrible, she made us laugh till we cried. But you know, it's all in the way you tell it, she said, seeing that Swann still looked grave. And imagining that it was perhaps because he did not like Francillon : Anyway, I think I'll be disappointed. I don't think it's as good as Serge Panine, which Mme de Crecy worships so. In that one, at least, there are deep things that make you think; but to give a recipe for salad on the stage of the Theatre-Francais! Whereas Serge Panine! But then, it's like everything that comes from Georges Ohnet's pen, it's always so well written. I don't know if you know Le Maitre de Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine. Forgive me, Swann said to her with irony, but I confess that my lack of admiration is almost equally divided between the two masterpieces. Really, what have you got against them? Are you sure you aren't prejudiced? Do you think perhaps they're a little dreary? Anyway, as I always say, one should never argue about novels or plays. Everyone has his own way of looking at things and what you find detestable may be the very thing I like best. She was interrupted by Forcheville addressing Swann. In fact, while Mme Cottard was talking about Francillon, Forcheville had told Mme Verdurin how much he admired what he called the painter's little 'speech'.54 The gentleman has a facility for speaking, a memory, he had said to Mme Verdurin when the painter was finished, such as I have rarely encountered! By my bootlaces! I'd love to have such a gift. He would make an excellent preacher. One may say that with him and M. Brechot, you have two real characters, one as good as the other, though for gift of the gab I'm not even sure this one would not in fact spike the professor's guns. It comes out more naturally, it's less studied. Although now and then he does use words that are a bit on the vulgar side, but that's the thing to do nowadays. It's not often that I've seen anyone hold the floor so cleverly 'hold the spittoon', as we used to say in the regiment, and come to think of it, it was in the regiment that I had a friend the gentleman rather reminded me of. Apropos of anything, I don't know what, this glass, for instance, he could rattle on for hours; no, not about this glass, that's a silly thing to say; but about the Battle of Waterloo, anything you like, and he would throw in things you never would have thought of. Why, Swann was in the same regiment; he must have known him. Do you see M. Swann often? asked Mme Verdurin. Oh no, answered M. de Forcheville, and since in order to get to know Odette more easily he wanted to be pleasant to Swann, he attempted to seize this opportunity of flattering him by talking about his distinguished friends, but talking about them as a man of the world, in the tone of an affectionate critic and not as though he were congratulating him as on an unhoped-for success: 'Isn't it so, Swann? I never see you. Anyway, how could I ever see him? The man is always hanging about with the La Tremoilles,55 with the Laumes, people like that!...' An imputation especially false, since, for a year now, Swann had hardly gone anywhere but to the Verdurins'. But the mere name of a person they did not know was greeted by a reproving silence on their part. M. Verdurin, afraid of the painful impression that these names of 'bores', especially when tactlessly hurled thus in the faces of all the faithful, must have produced on his wife, secretly cast at her a glance full of worried solicitude. He saw then that in her resolution not to take action, not to have been affected by the news that had just been announced to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, the way we pretend to be deaf when a friend who has offended us tries to slip into the conversation an excuse which we would seem to accept if we listened to it without protesting, or when someone utters in our presence the forbidden name of an ingrate, Mme Verdurin, so that her silence would not seem to be a form of consent, but rather the ignorant silence of an inanimate object, had suddenly divested her face of all life, all mobility; her prominent forehead was now merely a lovely study in the round, which the name of those La Tremoilles at whose house Swann was always hanging about had not been able to penetrate; her slightly wrinkled",2.819389012354683,0.9812571518350581,0.40615891675781324,0.07108152605567644,4.1931377974543445,4.0,2.3048749987039403,25.09722222222222,18.0,25.76882252851637,1.2529053680132818,1.0,0.608654720054454,1807,608,0.3364692861095739,8013,72,66.77470999351948,9.997423298948001e+28,4.66515319596267e+25,0.727561698832982,0.7072018389190946,75.36552531052082,8.982200009223394,9.827888789773866,12.23036647604993,10.868290137121072,7.676236856668513,41.36728309659964,4.083333333333333,True,1194.0,0.8730751283247783,3.7391507232851144,2143.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006521960664424743,0.005502904310608377,0.004891470498318557,0.015865608959402706,59,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"nose revealed an indentation that seemed copied from life. Her half-open mouth seemed about to speak. She was now merely a lost wax, a plaster mask, a model for a monument, a bust for the Palais de l'Industrie56 in front of which the public would certainly stop to admire how the sculptor, by expressing the indefeasible dignity of the Verdurins as opposed to that of the La Tremoilles and the Laumes, whose equals they naturally were, as they were the equals of all the bores on earth, had managed to give an almost papal majesty to the whiteness and rigidity of the stone. But at last the marble came to life and insinuated that one could not be squeamish if one wanted to go to the homes of these people, because the wife was always drunk and the husband so ignorant that he said 'collidor' instead of 'corridor'. You'd have to pay me handsomely before I'd let that sort enter my house, concluded Mme Verdurin, looking at Swann with an imperious air. She probably did not hope that he would be submissive enough to imitate the saintly simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who had just exclaimed: 'You see that? What astonishes me is that there's still people who'll speak to them! I think I would be too afraid: once struck, out of luck! How can there still be folks low enough to go running after them?' but that he would at least answer like Forcheville: 'Lord, she's a duchess; some people are still impressed by that,' which had at least allowed Mme Verdurin to reply: 'Much good may it do them!' Instead of that, Swann merely laughed with an air that signified that he could not even take such extravagant nonsense seriously. M. Verdurin, continuing to cast furtive glances at his wife, saw with sadness and understood all too well that she was feeling the rage of a grand inquisitor who cannot manage to extirpate the heresy, and in order to try to lead Swann to a recantation, since the courage of one's convictions always seems to be a calculation and an act of cowardice in the eyes of those who do not share them, M. Verdurin challenged him: Now tell us frankly what you think of them, we won't repeat it to them. To which Swann answered: Why, it's not in the least out of fear of the duchess (if you're talking about the La Tremoilles). I assure you everyone likes to visit her. I'm not saying she's 'profound' (he pronounced 'profound' as if it were a ridiculous word, because his language still bore the trace of habits of mind which his recent rejuvenation, marked by a love of music, had temporarily made him lose so that at times he now expressed his opinions warmly ) but I'm quite sincere when I say that she's intelligent and her husband is truly well-read. They're charming people. Whereupon Mme Verdurin, feeling that because of this one infidel she would be prevented from creating a complete moral unanimity among the little clan, was unable to stop herself, in her rage against this stubborn man who did not see how much his words were making her suffer, from crying out to him from the depths of her heart: Believe it if you like, but at least don't say it to us. It all depends on what you call intelligence, said Forcheville, who felt it was his turn to shine. Now, Swann, what do you mean by intelligence? There you are! exclaimed Odette. That's the sort of big subject I'm always asking him to talk to me about, but he never will. But I do... protested Swann. What tripe! said Odette. Tripe with onions? asked the doctor. As you see it, Forcheville went on, does intelligence mean a gift of the gab, does it have to do with how people manage to worm their way in? Finish up so they can take your plate, said Mme Verdurin sourly, turning to Saniette, who, absorbed in thought, had stopped eating. And perhaps a little ashamed of the tone she had taken: Never mind, take your time, I only said it for the sake of the others, because it holds up the next course. There is, said Brichot, rapping out the syllables, a very curious definition of intelligence in that gentle anarchist, Fenelon57.. Listen! said Mme Verdurin to Forcheville and the doctor. 'He's going to give us Fenelon's definition of intelligence. Now that's interesting. It's not often you have a chance of hearing that. But Brichot was waiting for Swann to give his own definition. Swann did not answer, and by avoiding them like this spoiled the brilliant contest that Mme Verdurin was so delighted to be able to offer Forcheville. Naturally. He's just like that with me all the time, said Odette sulkily. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one he doesn't think is up to his level. Those de la Tremouailles,58 who are so little to be recommended, as Mme Verdurin has shown us, asked Brichot with powerfully clear articulation, are they descended from the folk whom Mme de Sevigne, that good snob, admitted she was pleased to know because it was good for her peasants? Of course, the marquise had another reason, and one that had to be more important to her, for as a woman of letters through and through, she put copy before all else. Now in the journal she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme de la Tremouaille, kept well informed by her great connections, who supplied the foreign politics. Why, no, I don't think it's the same family, ventured Mme Verdurin. Saniette, who, after hurriedly giving the butler his plate, which was still full, had plunged back into a meditative silence, emerged from it at last to tell them with a smile the story of a dinner he had attended with the Duc de La Tremoille at which it turned out that the Duc did not know George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who was fond of Saniette, thought he ought to supply him with a few particulars about the Duc's culture proving that such ignorance on the Duc's part was materially impossible; but suddenly he stopped, realizing that Saniette did not need those proofs and knew the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had just invented it a moment ago. That excellent man suffered from being thought such a bore by the Verdurins; and, aware that he had been even duller than usual at this dinner, he had not wanted to let it end before he succeeded in amusing them. He capitulated so quickly, looked so unhappy at seeing that the effect on which he had counted had failed, and answered Swann in such a pitiful tone so that Swann would not persist in a refutation that was henceforth pointless 'All right, all right; and if I'm mistaken it's not a crime, I hope,' that Swann would have liked to be able to say the story was true and delightful. The doctor, who had been listening to them, thought this was the moment to say: Se non evero,59 but he was not sure quite sure of the words and was afraid of getting muddled. After dinner, Forcheville went up to the doctor. She must not have been too bad at one time, Mme Verdurin, and she's a woman you can talk to; for me that's everything. Of course she's beginning to get a bit long in the tooth. But Mme de Crecy now there's a little woman who seems intelligent oh yes, by God, you can see at a glance that she keeps her eyes peeled! We're talking about Mme de Crecy, he said to M. Verdurin, who was approaching, his pipe in his mouth. I would imagine that as a specimen of the female figure... I'd rather have it in my bed than a slap with a wet fish, Cottard rushed to say, having waited in vain for some moments for Forcheville to pause for breath so that he could insert that old joke, which he feared would not be appropriate again if the conversation changed course, and which he delivered with that excess of spontaneity and assurance which attempts to mask the coldness and anxiety inseparable from a recitation. Forcheville was familiar with the joke, he understood it and was amused by it. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing with his mirth, because he had recently discovered a signal for expressing it different from the one used by his wife, but just as simple and clear. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a person shaking with laughter than he would immediately begin coughing as if, in laughing too hard, he had swallowed smoke from his pipe. And still keeping the pipe in one corner of his mouth, he would indefinitely prolong the pantomime of suffocation and hilarity. Thus he and Mme Verdurin, who, across from him, listening to the painter tell her a story, was closing her eyes before dropping her face into her hands, looked like two theatre masks each in its own way representing merriment. M. Verdurin had in fact been wise not to withdraw his pipe from his mouth, for Cottard, who needed to leave the room for a moment, made a joke under his breath that he had learned recently and that he repeated each time he had to go to the same place: 'I must absent myself for a moment in aid of the Duc d'Aumale,'60 so that M. Verdurin's fit began again. Take your pipe out of your mouth. Can't you see you're going to choke to death trying not to laugh? Mme Verdurin said to him as she came around offering the liqueurs. How charming your husband is, he has wit enough for four, declared Forcheville to Mme Cottard. Thank you, Madame. An old soldier like me never refuses a drop. M. de Forcheville thinks Odette is charming, said M. Verdurin to his wife. Why, actually she would like to come to lunch with you some time. We're going to contrive to make it happen, but Swann mustn't hear of it. You know, he puts rather a damper on things. That won't mean you shouldn't come to dinner, of course, we hope to have you very often. With summer coming, we'll be dining outdoors quite frequently. That won't bore you, will it little dinners in the Bois? Good, good, it'll be very nice. Aren't you going to go do your job, now?' she cried out to the little pianist, in order to display, in front of a newcomer as important as Forcheville, both her wit and her tyrannical power over the faithful.

"de Forcheville was saying bad things to me about you, said Mme Cottard to her husband when he returned to the drawing-room. And he, pursuing the idea of Forcheville's noble lineage, which had preoccupied him from the beginning of dinner, said to him: I'm treating a baroness just now, Baronne Putbus;61 the Putbuses took part in the Crusades, didn't they? They have a lake in Pomerania that's so big it must be ten times the size of the place de la Concorde. I'm treating her for rheumatoid arthritis; she's a charming woman. In fact she knows Mme Verdurin, I believe. Which allowed Forcheville, finding himself, a moment later, alone with Mme Cottard, to complete the favourable judgment that he had passed on her husband: And he's so interesting, you can tell he knows a few people. Lord, these doctors know such a lot! I'm going to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann, said the pianist. My God! I trust it's not the 'sonata-snake'? 62 asked M. de Forcheville to create an effect. But Doctor Cottard, who had never heard that pun, did not understand it and thought M. de Forcheville was making a mistake. He went up to them briskly to correct it: No, no, it's not serpent a sonates, it's serpent a sonnettes, he said in a tone that was zealous, impatient and triumphant. Forcheville explained the pun to him. The doctor blushed. Admit that it's funny, Doctor! Oh, I've known it for too long, answered Cottard. But they fell silent; under the agitation of the violin tremolos protecting it with their quivering extended two octaves above and as in a mountainous countryside, behind the apparent and vertiginous immobility of a waterfall one sees, two hundred feet down, the minuscule form of a woman walking the little phrase had just appeared, distant, graceful, protected by the long unfurling of its transparent, ceaseless curtain of sound. And Swann, in his heart, appealed to it as to a confidant of his love, as to a friend of Odette's who certainly should tell her to pay no attention to that Forcheville. Ah, you're late! said Mme Verdurin to a regular whom she had invited only 'for coffee', 'Brichot was incomparable so eloquent! But he's gone. Isn't that right, Monsieur Swann? I believe it was the first time you and he had met, she said in order to point out to him that she was the one to whom he owed the introduction. Wasn't our Brichot delicious? Swann bowed politely. He didn't interest you? Mme Verdurin asked him curtly. Why, of course, Madame, very much, I was delighted. He is perhaps a little peremptory and a little jovial for my taste. I would like to see some hesitation, some gentleness now and then, but one senses that he knows so many things and he seems like an all-round decent man. Everyone went home very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: I've rarely seen Mme Verdurin as spirited as she was this evening. What exactly is this Mme Verdurin of yours, rather a mixed bag of goods? said Forcheville to the painter, whom he had invited to ride with him. Odette watched with regret as he went off; she did not dare decline to ride with Swann, but was in a bad mood in the carriage, and when he asked her if he ought to come in, she said, 'Of course,' shrugging her shoulders impatiently. When all the guests had gone, Mme Verdurin said to her husband: Did you notice how Swann laughed foolishly when we were talking about Mme La Tremoille?' She had noticed that several times, when saying this name, Swann and Forcheville had omitted the particle. Having no doubt that they did this to show they were not intimidated by titles, she wanted to imitate their pride, but had not fully understood by which grammatical form it was expressed. And so her incorrect way of speaking won out over her republican intransigence, and she still said 'the de la Tremoilles' or rather, using an abbreviation current in the words of the cafe songs and caricature captions, which swallowed the de, 'the d'La Tremoilles', but she made up for it by saying: 'Madame La Tremoille'. 'The Duchesse, as Swann calls her,' she added ironically with a smile which proved she was only quoting and did not accept responsibility for so naive and ridiculous a denomination. I must tell you I found him extremely stupid. And M. Verdurin answered her: He's not direct, he's cunning, always betwixt and between. He's a fellow who's always wanting to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. How different from Forcheville! There's a man who at least tells you fair and square what he's thinking. You either agree with him or you don't. He's not like the other, neither fish nor fowl. Anyway, Odette really seems to prefer Forcheville, and I think she's right. And then, also, since Swann wants to play the society man with us, defender of duchesses, at least the other has his own title; he's still the Comte de Forcheville, he added delicately, as if, well informed about the history of that dignity, he was scrupulously weighing its particular value. I must tell you, said Mme Verdurin, that he felt called upon to direct some venomous and quite ridiculous insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, since he saw that Brichot was well liked in this house, it was a way of attacking us, of disparaging our dinner-party. What I suspect is he's the sort of good friend who badmouths you on his way out. But that's what I told you, answered M. Verdurin. He's a typical failure, the little fellow envious of anything that's at all big. In reality there was not one of the faithful who was not more malicious than Swann; but they all took care to season their slander with familiar jokes, with little hints of anxiety and cordiality; whereas the slightest reserve that Swann allowed himself, omitting such conventional formulas as, 'Now I don't mean to say anything bad,' to which he did not deign to stoop, seemed perfidious. There are authors of true originality in whom the least boldness offends because they have not first flattered the tastes of the public and have not served it the commonplaces which it is used to; it was in the same way that Swann roused M. Verdurin's indignation. In Swann's case as in theirs, it was the novelty of his language that convinced one of the darkness of his intentions. Swann was still unaware of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins' and continued to regard all their absurdities in a favourable light, with the eyes of his love. Most of the time, at least, he met Odette only in the evening; but during the day, though he was afraid of causing her to become tired of him by going to her house, he wanted at least not to cease to occupy her thoughts and was always looking for an opportunity of involving himself in them, but in a way that would be pleasant for her. If, in the window of a florist or a jeweller, the sight of a shrub or a jewel charmed him, instantly he would think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure they had given him would be felt by her too, increasing her affection for him, and he would immediately have them delivered to the rue La Perouse so as not to delay the moment when, because she was receiving something from him, he would feel he was in some way close to her. He especially wanted her to receive them before she went out so that the gratitude she felt would win him a more tender welcome when she saw him at the Verdurins', or even who knows? if the shopkeeper was prompt enough, perhaps a letter which she would send him before dinner, or her arrival in person at his house, in a supplementary visit to thank him. Just as he had once tested Odette's nature for reactions of resentment, so now he sought by reactions of gratitude to extract from her intimate particles of feeling that she had not yet revealed to him. Often, she had money troubles and, hard pressed by a debt, would ask him for help. He was happy about that, as about everything that could give Odette a strong impression of the love he had for her, or simply a strong impression of his influence, of how useful he could be to her. No doubt if someone had said to him in the beginning: 'It's your position that attracts her,' and now: 'It's because of your wealth that she loves you,' he would not have believed it, and would also not have minded very much that people imagined she was attached to him that people felt they were joined together by something as powerful as snobbishness or money. But, even if he had thought it was true, perhaps he would not have been hurt by discovering within Odette's love for him that mainstay more durable than his charm or the qualities she might find in him: namely, self-interest, a self-interest that would prevent the day ever coming when she would be tempted to stop seeing him. For the moment, by overwhelming her with presents, by doing her favours, he could rely upon advantages extrinsic to his person, his intelligence, to take over from him the exhausting responsibility of pleasing her by himself. And as for the voluptuous pleasure of being in love, of living by love alone, the reality of which he doubted at times, it was increased in value for him, as dilettante of immaterial sensations, by the price he was paying her for it as we see people uncertain whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are delightful, convince themselves of it and also of the exceptional quality and disinterest of their own taste, by paying a hundred francs a day for a hotel room that allows them to enjoy that sight and that sound. One day when reflections of this kind were leading him back once again to the memory of the time when people had talked to him about Odette as a kept woman, and when he was amusing himself yet again by contrasting that strange personification, the kept woman an iridescent amalgam of unfamiliar and diabolical elements, set, like some apparition by Gustave Moreau,63 among venomous flowers interwoven with precious jewels with the Odette on whose face he had seen the same feelings of pity for a sufferer, revolt against an injustice, gratitude for a favour, that he had seen in earlier days on his own mother's face and on the",2.8851676173405725,1.131149422473633,0.44138531025682143,0.08266706081301724,4.3959025470653375,4.0,2.4795877286159294,25.083333333333332,17.0,23.04630001636802,1.321705426356589,1.0,0.6868843855217156,1806,661,0.36600221483942413,8296,72,64.94113833362806,1.598004606162855e+28,7.580667012157756e+24,0.6999672585180108,0.705280821451119,69.55913759689923,9.788624031007753,11.009331410519195,13.06766334440753,11.816367663344408,8.867840531561459,44.629291251384274,4.902777777777778,True,1134.0,0.877134724857685,3.935483870967742,2108.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007527733755942948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0071315372424722665,0.0017828843106180666,0.0,0.020872865275142316,61,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"faces of his friends, the Odette whose conversation had so often turned on the things he knew best himself, on his collections, his room, his old servant, the banker who looked after his securities, it happened that this last image of the banker reminded him that he would have to call on him soon to draw some money. In fact, if this month he was less liberal when helping Odette out of her material difficulties than he had been the month before when he had given her five thousand francs, and if he did not present her with a diamond riviere that she wanted, he would not reawaken her admiration for his generosity, her gratitude, which made him so happy, and he would even risk making her think that his love for her, as she saw its manifestations become less abundant, had diminished. Then, suddenly, he wondered if this was not precisely what was meant by 'keeping' her (as if, in fact, this notion of keeping could be derived from elements not at all mysterious or perverse but belonging to the intimate substance of his daily life, like that thousand-franc bill, domestic and familiar, torn and reglued, which his valet, after having paid the month's accounts and the quarter's rent for him, had locked in the drawer of the old desk from which Swann had taken it out again to send it with four others to Odette) and if one could not apply to Odette, starting from when he had come to know her (because he did not for a moment suspect that she could ever have received money from anyone before him), those words which he had believed so irreconcilable with her 'kept woman'. He could not study this idea in greater depth, because an attack of that mental laziness which in him was congenital, intermittent and providential, happened at that moment to extinguish all light in his intelligence, as abruptly as, later, when electric lighting had been installed everywhere, one could cut off the electricity in a house. His mind groped for a moment in the darkness, he took off his glasses, wiped the lenses, passed his hand over his eyes, and saw the light again only when he found himself in the presence of an entirely different idea, namely that he ought to try to send six or seven thousand frances to Odette next month instead of five, because of the surprise and pleasure it would give her. In the evening, when he did not stay at home waiting for the hour when he would meet Odette at the Verdurins' or rather in one of the summer restaurants they favoured in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go and dine in one of those elegant houses where he had once been a habitual guest at table. He did not want to lose touch with people who one never could tell might perhaps be useful to Odette one day and through whom, in the meantime, he often succeeded in pleasing her. Also, his long habit of society, of luxury, had given him, at the same time as a disdain for them, a need for them, so that by the time he had come to regard the most modest houses as exactly on the same plane as the most princely, his senses were so accustomed to the latter that he experienced some indisposition at finding himself in the former. He had the same esteem identical to a degree they could not have believed for a petit bourgeois family which asked him up to a dance on the fifth floor, Stairway D, left at the landing, as for the Princess of Parma, who gave the finest parties in Paris; but he did not have the feeling of being actually at a ball while standing with the fathers in the bedroom of the mistress of the house and the sight of the wash-stands covered with towels, of the beds, transformed into cloakrooms, their coverlets piled with overcoats and hats, gave him the same stifling sensation that people today who are used to twenty years of electricity may experience at the smell of a lamp blackening or a nightlight smoking. On the days when he dined in town, he would have the horses harnessed for seven-thirty; he would dress while thinking about Odette and so would not be alone, because the constant thought of Odette would give to the moments in which he was away from her the same particular charm as to those in which she was there. He would get into his carriage, but he would feel that this thought had leaped into it at the same time and settled on his knees like a beloved pet which one takes everywhere and which he would keep with him at the table, unbeknownst to the other guests. He would stroke it, warm himself at it, and, experiencing a sort of languor, yield to a light quivering that tensed his neck and his nose, and was new to him, all the while fastening the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. Having felt unwell and sad for some time, especially from the time that Odette had introduced Forcheville to the Verdurins, Swann would have liked to go and rest a little in the country. But he would not have had the courage to leave Paris for a single day while Odette was there. The air was warm; these were the finest days of spring. And though he might cross a city of stone to immure himself in some town house, what was constantly before his eyes was a park that he owned near Combray, where, from four o'clock on, before reaching the asparagus patch, because of the wind that comes from the fields of Meseglise, one could savour as much coolness under an arbour as at the edge of the pond encircled by forget-me-nots and gladioli, and where, when he dined, red currants and roses intertwined by his gardener ran around the table. After dinner, if the appointed meeting time at the Bois or Saint-Cloud was early, he would leave so soon after getting up from the table especially if rain was threatening to fall and make the 'faithful' go home earlier that once the Princesse des Laumes (at whose home they had dined late and whom Swann had left before coffee was served in order to join the Verdurins on the island in the Bois) had said: Really, if Swann were thirty years older and had bladder trouble, one would excuse him for running off like that. But the fact is he doesn't care what people think. He told himself that the charm of springtime which he could not go down to enjoy at Combray he could at least find on the Ile des Cygnes64 or at Saint-Cloud. But since he could think only about Odette, he did not even know if he had detected the smell of the leaves, if there had been any light from the moon. He was greeted by the little phrase from the sonata played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was no piano there, the Verdurins would take great pains to have one brought down from a bedroom or dining-room: it was not that Swann had come back into favour with them, on the contrary. But the idea of organizing an ingenious pleasure for someone, even for someone they did not like, fostered in them, during the time required for these preparations, exceptional and ephemeral feelings of warmth and cordiality. Now and then he would say to himself that another spring evening was passing, he would force himself to pay attention to the trees, the sky. But the agitation with which Odette's presence filled him, and also a slight feverish indisposition that had hardly left him for some time now, denied him that calm and well-being which are the indispensable background to the impressions we derive from nature. One evening when Swann had agreed to dine with the Verdurins, and had just mentioned during dinner that the next day he was going to attend a banquet for old comrades, Odette had answered him across the table, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the faithful, in front of the painter, in front of Cottard: Yes, I know you have your banquet, so I won't see you till I get home, but don't be too late. Even though Swann had never become very seriously offended by Odette's friendliness towards one or another of the faithful, he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her confess in front of everyone this way, with such calm lack of modesty, to their regular meetings every night, his privileged position in her house and the preference for him which it implied. Of course Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman, and the ascendancy he exerted over a creature so inferior to him was not something that ought to appear to him very flattering to see proclaimed to all the 'faithful', but from the time he had first noticed that many men found Odette an enchanting and desirable woman, the attraction which her body had for them had awoken in him a painful need to master her entirely even in the smallest parts of her heart. And he had begun to set an inestimable price on those times spent in her house at night, when he would sit her on his knees, make her say what she thought of one thing, of another, when he would count up the only goods whose possession he now valued on earth. And so, after this dinner, taking her aside, he did not fail to thank her effusively, endeavouring to teach her according to the degrees of gratitude he displayed to her, the scale of pleasures that she could give him, the highest of which was to guarantee him, during the time that his love should last and make him vulnerable to them, protection from the assaults of jealousy. When he came away from the banquet the next day, it was pouring with rain, all he had was his victoria; a friend offered to drive him home in his coupe, and because Odette, by the fact that she had asked him to come, had given him the assurance that she was not waiting for anyone else, it was with a tranquil mind and a happy heart that, rather than set off in the rain like this, he would have gone back home to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he did not seem anxious to spend the last part of every evening without exception in her company, she might neglect to reserve it for him, precisely the one time when he particularly desired it.",3.971352563164338,1.2570112038671943,0.43218050851666306,0.05074529355569256,4.312707182320442,4.0,2.239155293424277,54.84848484848485,52.0,30.99083071834969,1.2613259668508288,1.0,0.6171547697034445,1810,642,0.3546961325966851,8028,33,60.19472362244324,1.3875105977094192e+26,6.8824930441935475e+22,0.8524646824225783,0.8626136741330547,44.4556110832078,20.68455549974887,13.172668634160413,24.193537585802783,26.307093252971704,9.019049723756904,70.87058429599867,8.787878787878787,True,1154.0,0.9017857142857143,3.982142857142857,2016.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013024013024013023,0.007122507122507123,0.003968253968253968,0.007936507936507936,62,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"He reached her house after eleven o'clock, and, as he was apologizing for not being able to come earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late, the storm had made her unwell, she had a headache and warned him that she would not keep him more than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; and, soon afterwards, she felt tired and wanted to go to sleep. So, no cattleyas tonight? he said to her, after I was so hoping for a nice little cattleya. And, a little sulky and irritable, she answered: No, no, darling, no cattleyas tonight, you can see I'm unwell! It might have done you good, but I won't insist. She asked him to turn out the light before he went, he himself closed the curtains of the bed and left. But when he was back at home, the idea came to him abruptly that perhaps Odette had been waiting for someone else that night, had only pretended to be tired and had asked him to turn out the lights only so that he would believe she was going to go to sleep, that as soon as he left, she had turned the lights on again, and let in the man who was going to spend the night with her. He looked at the time. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her, he went back out, took a hackney carriage and stopped it very close to where she lived, in a little street perpendicular to the one on to which the back of her house opened and into which he sometimes went to knock at the window of her bedroom so that she would come and open the door for him; he got out of the carriage, the neighbourhood was dark and deserted, he had only to walk a few steps and he came out almost opposite her house. Amid the blackness of all the windows in the street in which the lights had long since been put out, he saw just one from which there spilled out between shutters which pressed its mysterious golden pulp the light which filled the bedroom and which, on so many other evenings, as soon as he saw it when he came into the street, lifted his spirits and announced to him: 'She's there waiting for you' and which now tortured him by saying: 'She's there with the man she was waiting for.' He wanted to know who it was; he slipped along the wall as far as the window, but between the oblique slats of the shutters he could see nothing; all he heard in the silence of the night was the murmur of a conversation. Certainly it hurt him to see that light and know that in its golden atmosphere, behind the sash, the unseen and detested pair were moving about, to hear the murmur revealing the presence of the man who had come after he left, Odette's duplicity, the happiness she was enjoying with him. And yet he was glad he had come: the torment that had forced him to leave his house had become less acute as it became less vague, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, back then, a sudden helpless suspicion, was now in his grasp, fully illuminated by the lamp, an unwitting prisoner in that room into which, when he chose, he could go to surprise it and capture it; or rather he would knock on the shutters as he often did when he came very late; this way at least, Odette would learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and heard the talking, and that, after having just a moment ago pictured her laughing with the other man at his illusions, he would now be the one to see them, confident in their error, actually outwitted by him whom they believed to be so very far away and who, in fact, already knew he was going to knock at the shutters. And perhaps, what he was feeling at this moment, which was almost pleasant, was also something different from the assuaging of a doubt and a distress: it was a pleasure in knowledge. If, ever since he had fallen in love, things had regained for him a little of the delightful interest they had once had for him, but only insofar as they were illuminated by the memory of Odette, now it was another of the faculties of his studious youth that his jealousy revived, a passion for truth, but for a truth that was likewise interposed between him and his mistress, taking its light only from her, a completely individual truth whose sole object, of an infinite value and almost disinterested in its beauty, was Odette's actions, her relationships, her plans, her past. At all other periods of his life, the little everyday words and deeds of a person had always seemed worthless to Swann if someone conveyed them to him as the subject of a bit of gossip, he found such gossip meaningless, and, while he listened to it, only the most vulgar part of his attention was interested; these were the times when he felt himself to be most mediocre. But in this strange phase of love, an individual person assumes something so profound that the curiosity he now felt awakening in him concerning the smallest occupations of this woman, was the same curiosity he had once had about History. And all these things that would have shamed him up to now, such as spying, tonight, outside a window, tomorrow perhaps, for all he knew, cleverly inducing neutral people to speak, bribing servants, listening at doors, now seemed to him to be, fully as much as were the deciphering of texts, the weighing of evidence and the interpretation of old monuments, merely methods of scientific investigation with a real intellectual value and appropriate to a search for the truth. On the point of knocking on the shutters, he felt a pang of shame thinking that Odette was going to know he had been suspicious, that he had come back, that he had posted himself in the street. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was about to do was very uncouth, and from now on she would detest him, whereas now, for the moment, so long as he had not knocked, perhaps, even while deceiving him, she loved him. How often we sacrifice the fulfilment of a possible happiness to our impatience for an immediate pleasure! But the desire to know the truth was stronger and seemed to him nobler. He knew that the reality of certain circumstances which he would have given his life to reconstruct accurately could be read behind that window striated with light, as under the gold-illuminated cover of one of those precious manuscripts to whose artistic richness itself the scholar who consults them cannot remain indifferent. He felt a sensuous pleasure in finding out the truth that so impassioned him from this unique, ephemeral and precious copy of a translucid substance so warm and so beautiful. Then, too, the advantage he felt he had that he so needed to feel he had over them, was perhaps less in knowing than in being able to show them he knew. He raised himself on his tiptoes. He knocked. They had not heard, he knocked again more loudly, the conversation stopped. A man's voice which he tried to distinguish from among the voices of those of Odette's friends whom he knew asked: Who's there? He was not sure he recognized it. He knocked again. The window was opened, then the shutters. Now, there was no way to retreat and, since she was going to know everything, so as not to seem too wretched, too jealous and curious, he merely called out, carelessly and gaily: Please don't disturb yourself, I was just passing by, I saw the light was on, I wanted to know if you were feeling better. He looked. Before him, two old gentlemen were standing at the window, one holding a lamp, and then he saw the bedroom, a bedroom unknown to him. Because he was in the habit, when he came to Odette's house very late, of recognizing her window by the fact that it was the only one lit among windows that were all alike, he had made a mistake and knocked at the window after hers, which belonged to the adjoining house. He went away apologizing and returned home, happy that the satisfaction of his curiosity had left their love intact and that after having simulated a sort of indifference towards Odette for so long, he had not given her, by his jealousy, that proof of loving her too much, which, between two lovers, exempts, for ever after, from loving enough, the one who receives it. He did not talk to her about this misadventure, he himself did not think about it further. But now and then his thoughts as they moved about would come upon the memory of it which they had not noticed, bump up against it, drive it farther in, and Swann would feel a sudden, deep pain. As if it were a physical pain, Swann's mind could not lessen it; but at least with physical pain, because it is independent of thought, thought can dwell on it, note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this pain the mind, merely by recalling it, recreated it. To wish not to think about it was still to think about it, still to suffer from it. And when, chatting with friends, he forgot his hurt, all of a sudden a word someone said to him would make him change expression, like a wounded man whom some clumsy person has just carelessly touched on his sore arm or leg. When he left Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled her smiles, derisive when speaking of this or that other person, and affectionate towards him, the heaviness of her head which she had shifted from its axis to incline it, let it fall, almost despite herself, on his lips, as she had done the first time in the carriage, the languishing looks she had cast at him while she was in his arms, as with a shiver she pulled her inclined head in against her shoulder. But instantly his jealousy, as if it were the shadow of his love, would furnish itself with a duplicate of the new smile she had given him that very evening and which, inverse now, mocked Swann and was filled with love for another man with that inclination of her head but reversed towards",3.301373802627694,1.3244579474637306,0.4456532852592979,0.07455423361863635,4.2408435072142066,4.0,2.2547857498999186,39.17391304347826,32.0,33.72285017341395,1.2635960044395116,1.0,0.6169056980926635,1802,575,0.3190899001109878,7912,46,64.76259255511609,1.3367081021475783e+28,6.517348133337778e+24,0.8111582040786743,0.8011635846712373,60.173256285286925,14.59825893934276,11.38190600502167,17.800530811175985,18.13132944071804,8.380554938956713,55.48911837089224,6.391304347826087,True,1182.0,0.8854217454900049,3.8576304241833252,2051.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008031301482701812,0.00514827018121911,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00700164744645799,0.006177924217462933,0.004015650741350906,0.0014627011214041932,63,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"other lips, with all the marks of affection, now given to another man, that she had given him. And all the sensuous memories he carried away from her house were like so many sketches, 'plans' like those a decorator submits to you, that allowed Swann to form an idea of the ardent or swooning attitudes she might adopt with other men. So that he came to regret every pleasure he enjoyed with her, every invented caress whose sweetness he had been so imprudent as to point out to her, every grace he discovered in her, for he knew that a moment later, they would supply new instruments for torturing him. This torture became still crueller when Swann remembered a brief expression he had surprised, a few days before, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner, at the Verdurins'. Either because Forcheville, feeling that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour in their house, wanted to use him as a whipping-boy and shine in front of them at his expense, or because he had been irritated by a clumsy remark which Saniette had just made to him and which, in fact, had gone unnoticed by those present, who were not aware of the unpleasant allusion it might contain, quite against the wishes of the one who had uttered it without any malice, or finally because for some time now he had been looking for an opportunity to induce them to banish from the house someone who was too well acquainted with him and whom he knew to be so refined that he felt embarrassed at certain moments simply by his presence, Forcheville answered this clumsy remark of Saniette's with such coarseness, hurling insults at him, and emboldened, as he shouted, by Saniette's pain, his dismay, his entreaties, that the wretched man, after asking Mme Verdurin if he ought to stay, and receiving no answer, had left the house stammering, tears in his eyes. Odette had watched this scene impassively, but when the door closed on Saniette, lowering as it were by several notches her face's habitual expression, so as to be able to find herself, in her baseness, on an equal footing with Forcheville, she had made her eyes glitter with a sly smile of congratulations for the audacity he had shown, of mockery for the man who had been its victim; she had cast him a glance of complicity in evil which was so clearly intended to say: 'That finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see how pathetic he looked? He was actually crying,' that Forcheville, when his eyes met that glance, suddenly sobering from the anger or simulation of anger which still warmed him, smiled and answered: He need only have been friendly, and he would still be here. A good rebuke does a man no harm at any age. One day when Swann had gone out in the middle of the afternoon to pay a call, not having found the person he wanted to see, he had the idea of going to Odette's house at an hour when he never went there, but when he knew she was always at home having her nap or writing letters before tea-time, and when he would enjoy seeing her for a little while without bothering her. The concierge told him he thought she was there; he rang, thought he heard a noise, heard footsteps, but no one opened the door. Anxious, irritated, he went into the little street on which the other side of the house looked out, stood in front of the window of Odette's bedroom; the curtains prevented him from seeing anything, he knocked hard on the window-panes, called out; no one opened the window. He saw that some neighbours were watching him. He went away, thinking that after all, perhaps he had been mistaken in believing he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied by it that he could not think about anything else. An hour later, he came back. He found her there; she told him she had been at home earlier when he rang, but was sleeping; the bell had woken her, she had guessed it was Swann, she had run after him, but he had already left. She had certainly heard the sound of knocking at the window-panes. Swann immediately recognized this statement as one of those fragments of true fact which liars, when caught unprepared, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood they are inventing, believing they can accommodate it there and steal away its resemblance to the Truth. Of course when Odette had just done something she did not want to reveal, she would hide it deep inside herself. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she wanted to lie, she was overcome with uneasiness, all her ideas collapsed, her faculties of invention and reasoning were paralysed, she found nothing in her head but emptiness, yet it was necessary to say something, and all she would find within reach was the very thing she had wanted to conceal and which, being true, was all that had remained there. She would detach a little piece from it, unimportant in itself, telling herself that after all this was better since the detail was authentic and did not present the same dangers as a false detail. 'At least this is true, she would say to herself, so much is gained, anyway. He may make inquiries and he'll see that it's true, so at least it won't be this that gives me away.' She was wrong, it was precisely this that gave her away, she did not realize that the true detail had corners that could fit only into the contiguous details of the true fact from which she had arbitrarily detached it, corners which, whatever might be the invented details among which she placed it, would always reveal, by their excess of material and unfilled empty areas, that it was not from among these that it had come. 'She admits that she heard me ring, then knock, and that she thought it was me, that she wanted to see me, Swann said to himself. But this does not conform with the fact that no one opened the door.' But he did not point out this contradiction to her, because he thought that, left to herself, Odette would perhaps produce some lie that would be a faint indication of the truth; she would talk; he would not interrupt her, he would collect with an avid and painful piety the words she said to him, feeling (precisely because she was hiding it behind them as she talked to him) that, like the sacred veil, they retained the vague imprint, sketched the uncertain features, of that reality so infinitely precious and, alas! undiscoverable what she had been doing that afternoon at three o'clock, when he came of which he would never possess more than these lies, illegible and divine vestiges, and which now existed only in the memory of this woman, who would conceal it like stolen goods and contemplate it without being able to appreciate it, but would not hand it over to him. Of course, he fully suspected at times that in themselves Odette's daily actions were not passionately interesting, and that the relationships she might have with other men did not exhale naturally, universally and for every intelligent creature a morbid sadness capable of infecting one with a feverish desire to commit suicide. He would then realize that this interest, this sadness existed only in him like a disease, and that, once this disease was cured, Odette's actions, the kisses she might have given would become once again as harmless as those of so many other women. But the fact that the painful curiosity which Swann brought to them now had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him think it was unreasonable to consider this curiosity important and to use every possible means to satisfy it. For Swann was reaching an age at which one's philosophy encouraged by the current philosophy of the day, and also by that of the circle in which Swann had spent so much of his life, that of the social set attached to the Princesse des Laumes, where it was agreed that intelligence was in direct ratio to scepticism and nothing was real and incontestable except the individual tastes of each person is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of exteriorizing the objects of their aspirations, try to derive from the years that have already elapsed a stable residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent and which they will deliberately make it their primary concern that the kind of life they adopt may satisfy. Swann thought it prudent to make allowances in his life for the pain he felt at not knowing what Odette had been doing, just as he made allowances for the fresh outbreak which a damp climate might cause in his eczema; to provide in his budget for a sizeable sum of available funds for obtaining information about how Odette spent her days, without which he would feel unhappy, just as he reserved the same for other partialities from which he knew he could expect to derive pleasure, at least before he had fallen in love, like his partiality for collections and for good food. When he wanted to say good-bye to Odette in order to leave for home, she asked him to stay longer and even held him back suddenly, by taking his arm, when he was about to open the door to go out. But he took no notice of this, because among the multitude of gestures, remarks, minor incidents that fill a conversation, it is inevitable that we should come close, without detecting anything in them to attract our attention, to those that hide a truth our suspicions are blindly seeking, and that we should stop, on the other hand, at those behind which there is nothing. She kept saying to him: 'How unfortunate you never come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come, I don't see you.' He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed at having missed his visit, but, because she was good, desirous of pleasing him and often sad when she had vexed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sad this time at having deprived him of the pleasure of spending an hour together, a very great pleasure, not for her, but for him. Yet it was a thing unimportant enough so that the",3.672609763236276,1.1524111235711159,0.43664222294136806,0.03935702675445552,4.416159380188157,4.0,2.3265565980258587,46.333333333333336,40.0,38.09053542402481,1.2993912562257885,1.0,0.6616330898126674,1807,628,0.34753735473159936,8242,39,59.20056049276396,5.13424687670706e+25,2.509407075614399e+22,0.8192198386317805,0.8107178573672836,49.878166389964974,17.812816823464306,12.938931606803767,21.07898911639919,22.53677734735289,9.52816823464305,64.42962553034496,8.384615384615385,True,1152.0,0.8905180840664711,4.0283479960899315,2046.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004580760804620594,0.004580760804620594,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007767377016530572,0.00438159729137622,0.005078669587731528,0.007331378299120235,64,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pained air she continued to have ended by surprising him. She reminded him even more than usual, when she looked this way, of the faces of the women portrayed by the painter of the Primavera.65 She had, at these times, their sort of dejected and woebegone expression which seems about to succumb beneath the weight of a grief too heavy for them, when they are merely letting the child Jesus play with a pomegranate or watching Moses pour water into a trough.66 He had once before seen such a sadness in her, but he no longer knew when. And suddenly he remembered: it was when Odette had lied in talking to Mme Verdurin the day after that dinner to which she had not come on the pretext that she was ill and in reality in order to stay with Swann. Of course, even if she had been the most scrupulous of women, she might not have felt remorse over a lie as innocent. But the lies Odette generally told were less innocent and served to prevent discoveries that might have created for her, with one person or another, terrible difficulties. And so when she lied, overcome by fear, aware that she was not very well armed to defend herself, uncertain of success, she wanted to cry, from exhaustion, like certain children who have not slept. And she also knew that her lie was usually doing serious harm to the man to whom she was telling it, and into whose power she was perhaps going to fall if she lied badly. And so she felt at once humble and guilty in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant social lie, the association of sensations and memories would leave her with the faintness that follows overexertion and the regret that follows an act of malevolence. What depressing lie was she telling Swann that gave her this pained look, this plaintive voice which seemed to falter under the effort she demanded of herself and ask for forgiveness? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about the incident in the afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, that had perhaps not yet transpired and was quite imminent, something that might enlighten him about this truth. At that moment, he heard the bell ring. Odette did not stop talking, but her words were now no more than a long lament: her regret at not having seen Swann in the afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had turned into true despair. He could hear the front door closing again and the sound of a carriage, as if someone was going away again probably the one Swann was not supposed to meet after being told that Odette was out. Then, when he reflected that merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming he had managed to disturb so many arrangements she did not want him to discover, he was overcome with a feeling of discouragement, almost of despondency. But because he loved Odette, because he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity he might have inspired in himself he felt for her instead, and he murmured: 'Poor darling!' As he was leaving her, she picked up several letters that she had on her table and asked him if he would put them in the post. He took them away with him and, once he was home, saw that he had kept the letters on him. He returned as far as the post-office, drew them from his pocket and before tossing them into the box looked at the addresses. They were all for tradesmen, except one for Forcheville. He held it in his hand. He said to himself: 'If I saw what was inside it, I would know what she calls him, how she talks to him, if there's anything between them. It may even be that by not looking, I'm behaving with a lack of delicacy towards Odette, because this is the only way to free myself of a suspicion which is perhaps calumnious for her, which is in any case bound to hurt her, and which nothing would be able to destroy, once the letter was gone.' He returned home after leaving the post-office, but he had kept that last letter with him. He lit a candle and held up close to it the envelope he had not dared to open. At first he could not read anything, but the envelope was thin and, by making it adhere to the stiff card that was enclosed in it, he could read, through its transparency, the last words. It was a very cold, formal ending. If it had not been he looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, but instead Forcheville reading a letter addressed to Swann, Forcheville would have seen words that were far more affectionate! He took firm hold of the card that danced in the envelope, which was larger than it was, then, sliding it with his thumb, brought its different lines one after another under the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, the only part through which one could read. Despite this he could not distinguish anything very well. But it did not matter, because he had seen enough to realize that its subject was a minor, unimportant event that had nothing to do with a love affair; it was something relating to an uncle of Odette's. Swann had read clearly at the beginning of the line: 'I was right', but had not understood what Odette had done that was right, when suddenly, a word he had not at first been able to decipher appeared and illuminated the meaning of the entire sentence: 'I was right to open the door, it was my uncle.' Open the door! So Forcheville had been there that afternoon when Swann rang the bell, and she had made him leave, which was the source of the noise Swann had heard. Then he read the whole letter; at the end she apologized for having acted so unceremoniously towards him and said he had forgotten his cigarettes at her house, the same sentence she had written to Swann one of the first times he had come. But in Swann's case she had added: 'If you had left your heart here, I would not have let you take it away again.' For Forcheville nothing like that: no allusion that might suggest that they were having an affair. And in fact, Forcheville was more deceived in all this than he, since Odette was writing to him to assure him that the visitor had been her uncle. In the end he, Swann, was the one she considered important, the one for whom she had dismissed the other. And yet, if there was nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why had she not opened the door right away, why had she said, 'I did the right thing to open the door, it was my uncle'? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment, how would Forcheville even be able to explain to himself the fact that she had not opened the door? Swann remained there, disconsolate, embarrassed and yet happy, with this envelope which Odette had handed over to him quite fearlessly, so absolute was her confidence in his sense of delicacy, but through the transparent glazing of which was revealed to him, with the secret of an incident which he would never have believed it possible to find out, a little of Odette's life, as in a narrow illuminated section cut directly out of the unknown. Then his jealousy rejoiced over it, as if that jealousy had had an independent, selfish vitality, voracious for anything that would feed it, even at Swann's own expense. Now it had food and Swann was going to be able to begin worrying each day over the visitors Odette might have received at about five o'clock, and begin trying to learn where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's affection continued to preserve the same character imprinted on it from the very beginning by his ignorance as to how Odette spent her days and by the mental laziness that stopped him from compensating for his ignorance with his imagination. He had not been jealous at first of Odette's whole life, but only of the times when some circumstance, perhaps wrongly interpreted, led him to suppose that Odette might have deceived him. His jealousy, like an octopus that casts a first, then a second, then a third mooring, attached itself solidly first to that time, five o'clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to yet another. But Swann was not capable of inventing his sufferings. They were merely the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from outside. But outside, everything brought him more suffering. He wanted to separate Odette from Forcheville, take her to spend a few days in the south. But he believed all the men who happened to be in the hotel desired her and that she desired them. And so he who in former days, when travelling, had sought out new people, large groups, now appeared unsociable, appeared to be fleeing the company of men as if it had cruelly wounded him. And how could he not be misanthropic, when he saw every man as a possible lover of Odette's? And so his jealousy, even more than the sensuous and light-hearted feeling he had at first had for Odette, altered Swann's character and changed entirely, in the eyes of other people, the very appearance of the external signs by which that character was manifested. A month after the day on which he had read the letter addressed by Odette to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. At the moment when they were preparing to leave, he noticed some confabulations between Mme Verdurin and several of the guests and thought he heard them reminding the pianist to come to a party at Chatou67 the next day; yet, he, Swann, had not been invited. The Verdurins had spoken in low voices and in vague terms, but the painter, probably inattentive, exclaimed: There must be no lights, and have him play the 'Moonlight' Sonata in the dark so we can watch how the light comes up. Mme Verdurin, seeing that Swann was two steps away, now wore that expression in which the desire to make the person who is talking be quiet and the desire to maintain a look of innocence in the eyes of the person who is hearing, neutralize each other in an intense nullity of gaze, in which the motionless",3.368099912089554,1.0037489043255878,0.4190212979322132,0.06271480160124052,4.331853496115428,4.0,2.29987593272998,30.54237288135593,30.0,16.690931297856718,1.2841287458379578,1.0,0.6279320048670755,1802,580,0.3218645948945616,8057,59,61.6763069161594,6.1049169161035186e+26,3.0058675116216242e+23,0.8349046157351856,0.8230225161502236,67.19719962753253,11.474244624616716,11.24230427200758,14.858458586504637,14.244216407381629,8.702153163152051,48.13393780921386,5.372881355932203,True,1158.0,0.8931560807483998,3.967011324470704,2031.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012884244699198539,0.0066957492137567215,0.0066957492137567215,0.0066957492137567215,0.0066957492137567215,0.0,0.008521862635690372,0.004463832809171148,0.0,0.0103397341211226,65,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"sign of intelligence and complicity is concealed beneath an innocent smile and which in the end, being common to all those who find themselves making a social blunder, reveals it instantly, if not to those making it, at least to the one who is its victim. Odette suddenly had the desperate look of one who has given up fighting the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann anxiously counted the minutes that separated him from the time when, after leaving the restaurant, during the drive home with her, he would be able to ask her for an explanation, persuade her not to go to Chatou the next day or to see that he was invited, and to soothe in her arms the anguish he was feeling. At last the carriages were sent for. Mme Verdurin said to Swann: Well now, good-bye, we'll see you soon, I trust? attempting by the amiableness of her gaze and the constraint of her smile to keep him from realizing that she was not saying to him, as she had always done until now: 'Tomorrow, then, at Chatou, the day after at my house. M. and Mme Verdurin made Forcheville get in with them, Swann's carriage had pulled up behind theirs and he was waiting for theirs to leave so that he could help Odette into his. Odette, we're taking you home, said Mme Verdurin, we have a little spot for you here next to M. de Forcheville. All right, Madame, answered Odette. What? I thought I was driving you home, cried Swann, saying what had to be said without dissembling, because the carriage door was open, the seconds were numbered, and he could not go home without her in his present state. But Mme Verdurin asked me.. Now, you can certainly go home alone, we've let you have her to yourself often enough, said Mme Verdurin. But I had something important to say to Madame. Well, you can write it to her in a letter... Good-bye, Odette said, holding out her hand. He tried to smile but looked utterly crushed. Did you see the way Swann permits himself to act with us now? said Mme Verdurin to her husband when they were back at home. I thought he was going to eat me alive, because we were taking Odette with us. It's quite unseemly, really! Let him just say right out that we're running a house of assignation! I don't understand how Odette can tolerate such behavior. He absolutely seems to be saying: you belong to me. I'm going to tell Odette what I think, I hope she'll understand. And she also added, a moment later, angrily: No, really, the filthy creature! using, without realizing it, and perhaps responding to the same obscure need to justify herself like Francoise at Combray when the chicken did not want to die the same words which the last twitches of an inoffensive animal in its death-throes wring from the countryman who is killing it. And when Mme Verdurin's carriage had left and Swann's came forward, his coachman looked at him and asked if he was not ill or if there had been an accident. Swann sent him away, he wanted to walk, and he returned home on foot through the Bois. He talked to himself out loud, in the same slightly artificial tone he had always used when he enumerated the charms of the little clan and extolled the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them sweet, if they were addressed to another man, in the same way, the Verdurins' salon, which only recently had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a real enthusiasm for art and even a sort of moral nobility, now that a man other than himself was the one Odette was going there to meet, to love without restraint, exhibited to him its absurdities, its foolishness, its ignominy. He pictured to himself with disgust the next day's soiree at Chatou. 'The idea of going to Chatou anyway! Like drapers after shutting up shop! These people really are sublimely bourgeois, they can't really exist, they must have come out of a Labiche comedy!'68 The Cottards would be there, maybe Brichot. 'It's quite grotesque, the lives of these nonentities, always in each other's pockets like this. They would feel utterly lost, I swear, if they didn't all meet up again tomorrow at Chatou!' Alas! the painter would be there too, the painter who enjoyed 'matchmaking', who would invite Forcheville to come to his studio with Odette. He could see Odette in clothes far too formal for this country outing, 'because she's so vulgar and worst of all, poor little thing, such a fool!!!' He could hear the jokes that Mme Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the bore might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he saw Odette laughing, laughing with him, almost inside him. Now he felt that perhaps they would be making Odette laugh at him. 'What fetid humour! he said, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so powerful that he felt the muscular sensation of his grimace even in his neck, flung back against the collar of his shirt. And how can a creature whose face is made in the image of God find anything to laugh about in those nauseating jokes? Any nose of any delicacy at all would turn away with horror so as not to allow itself to be offended by such musty odours. It's really incredible to think that a human being could fail to understand that, by permitting herself to smile at the expense of a fellow human being who has loyally reached out his hand to her, she is sinking down into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I live too many leagues above the swamp in which these vermin are gabbling and wallowing to be splattered by the jokes of a Verdurin, he cried, lifting his head, proudly throwing back his shoulders. As God is my witness, I have honestly tried to pull Odette up out of there, and lift her into a nobler and purer atmosphere. But every human being has only so much patience, and mine is exhausted,' he said to himself, as if this mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasm dated from farther back than the last few minutes and as if he had not taken it upon himself only when he thought perhaps these sarcasms were aimed at him and were attempting to separate Odette from him. He could see the pianist preparing to play the 'Moonlight' Sonata and the faces Mme Verdurin would make as she grew dismayed at the harm that Beethoven's music was going to do to her nerves: 'Idiot, liar! he exclaimed. And the woman pretends to love Art!' She would tell Odette, after having adroitly insinuated a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for him: 'Make a little room next to you for M. de Forcheville.' 'In the dark! The pimp, the procuress!' 'Procuress' was also the name he applied to the music that would invite them to be quiet, to dream together, to look at each other, to take each other by the hand. He found there was some good to be said for the severity towards the arts displayed by Plato, by Bossuet,69 and by the old school of French education. In fact, the life one led at the Verdurins' and which he had so often called 'real life' seemed to him the worst of all, and their little clan the lowest of social circles. 'It really is, he said, the lowest thing on the social ladder, Dante's last circle.70 No doubt about it, the venerable text refers to the Verdurins! Really, the fashionable folk, whom one may vilify, but who all the same are different from these gangs of yobs, show a most profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them! What sound intuition there is in that Noli me tangere71 of the Faubourg Saint-Germain!' He had long since left the avenues of the Bois, he had nearly reached his house, and still, not yet sobered from his pain and from the insincere exuberance with which the deceitful intonations, the artificial sonority of his own voice, pouring into him more abundantly every minute, had intoxicated him, he continued to perorate out loud in the silence of the night: 'Society people have their faults, as no one knows better than I do, but all the same really these are people for whom certain things are out of the question. I can think of one fashionable woman who was far from perfect, but all the same really she had a basic decency, a sense of honour in her dealings that would have made her incapable, whatever might happen, of any sort of treachery and which is quite sufficient to put a vast gulf between her and a vixen like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, one may truly say they are the ultimate, they are perfect specimens of their kind! Thank God it was high time I stopped condescending to mix in utter promiscuousness with such infamy, such excrement.' But, just as the virtues which he had attributed that same afternoon to the Verdurins would not have been enough, had they even really possessed them but had not encouraged and protected his love, to provoke in Swann that intoxication in which he was moved by their magnanimity and which, even if it was propagated through other people, could only come to him from Odette in the same way, the immorality that he now saw in the Verdurins, had it been real, would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unleash his indignation and cause him to vilify 'their infamy'. And no doubt Swann's voice was more perceptive than he was himself, when it refused to pronounce these words filled with disgust for the Verdurin social circle and joy at being done with it, otherwise than in an artificial tone and as if they were chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he was indulging in these invectives, were probably, without his noticing it, occupied with a completely different object, for once he reached home, scarcely had he closed the carriage gate behind him, than suddenly he struck himself on the forehead, and, opening it again, went out again exclaiming in a natural voice this time: 'I think I've",3.02344622938799,1.409351555666271,0.4360557635791016,0.08052235790310322,4.349778270509978,4.0,2.2749345049547727,25.055555555555557,16.5,23.18098411826724,1.2915742793791574,1.0,0.6240877728749179,1804,635,0.35199556541019955,8175,72,62.85454343511721,1.983267871300961e+27,9.493862476309052e+23,0.6707179546356201,0.659410709887743,72.1364270756344,9.422243163340728,10.62613485830676,12.771667898497169,11.585233431879779,8.59532150776053,42.51675289480168,4.375,True,1145.0,0.874581139301101,3.913355672570608,2089.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009022556390977444,0.009022556390977444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007518796992481203,0.005112781954887218,0.0,0.01771182383915749,66,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou tomorrow!' But the way must have been bad, for Swann was not invited: Doctor Cottard, who, summoned to the country on a serious case, had not seen the Verdurins for several days and had not been able to go to Chatou, said, the day after that dinner, as he sat down to the table at their house: Why, won't we be seeing M. Swann this evening? He is certainly what you call a personal friend of... Why, I should hope not! cried Mme Verdurin. May the Lord preserve us from him, he is deadly dull, stupid and ill-mannered. At these words Cottard showed surprise and submission at the same time, as though confronted with a truth contrary to everything he had believed up to then, but irresistibly obvious; and, lowering his nose nervously and timidly into his plate, he confined himself to answering: 'Ah! -ah!', traversing along a descending scale, in his forced but orderly retreat into the depths of himself, the entire register of his voice. And Swann was never mentioned again at the Verdurins'. So the salon which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle to their meetings. She no longer said to him as she had in the early days of their love: 'We'll see each other tomorrow night anyway, there's a supper at the Verdurins',' but: 'We won't be able to see each other tomorrow night, there's a supper at the Verdurins'. ' Or else the Verdurins were to take her to the Opera-Comique to see Une Nuit de Cleopatre72 and Swann would read in Odette's eyes that fear of his asking her not to go, which once upon a time he would not have been able to keep himself from kissing as it passed over his mistress's face, and which now exasperated him. 'It's not anger, however, he said to himself, that I feel when I see that she wants to go and scratch about in that excremental music. It's sorrow, not for myself certainly, but for her; sorrow at seeing that after more than six months of living in daily contact with me, she has not managed to change enough to eliminate Victor Masse spontaneously! Especially for not having come to understand that there are evenings when a person of any subtlety at all must know how to give up a pleasure, when one asks it of her. She ought to know how to say ""I won't go,"" if only by using her intelligence, since it is on the basis of her answer that one will rate once and for all the quality of her soul.' And having persuaded himself that it really was only in order to be able to pass a more favourable judgment on Odette's spiritual value that he wanted her to stay with him that evening instead of going to the Opera-Comique, he presented her with the same reasoning, with the same degree of insincerity as he had presented it to himself, and even with one degree more, for now he was also responding to a desire to capture her through her self-love. I swear, he said to her a few moments before she left for the theatre, that in asking you not to go out, my every wish, if I were selfish, would be for you to refuse me, because I have a thousand things to do this evening and I will find that I myself am trapped and thus quite annoyed if against all expectations you answer me that you won't go. But my own occupations, my own pleasures, aren't everything, I have to think of you. There may come a day when, seeing me gone from you for ever, you will be justified in reproaching me for not having warned you in those crucial moments when I felt I was going to pass judgment on you, make one of those severe criticisms which do such damage to feelings of love. You see, Une Nuit de Cleopatre (what a title!) doesn't really matter. What I must know is whether you are really one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality, and even of charm, the sort of despicable creature who is incapable of giving up a pleasure. Now, if this is what you are, how could anyone love you, for you're not even a person, a clearly defined entity, imperfect, but at least perfectible? You're only a formless stream of water running down whatever slope it finds, a fish without a memory, without a thought in its head, living in its aquarium, mistaking the glass for water and bumping against it a hundred times a day. Do you realize that your answer will have the effect I won't say of making me stop loving you immediately, of course, but of making you less attractive in my eyes when I realize that you're not a person, that you're lower than all other things, that I can't place you above any of them? Obviously I would have preferred to ask you as a thing of no importance to give up Une Nuit de Cleopatre (since you oblige me to soil my lips with that despicable name) in hopes that you would go anyway. But since I've decided to tally the account, to draw such inferences from your answer, I thought it would be more honest to let you know. For some time, Odette had shown signs of agitation and uncertainty. Although she failed to grasp the meaning of this speech, she did understand that it might belong to the category of 'scoldings' and scenes of reproach or supplication, and her familiarity with men enabled her, without paying attention to the details of what they said, to conclude that they would not make such scenes if they were not in love, that since they were in love it was pointless to obey them, that they would be only more in love afterwards. And so she would have listened to Swann with the utmost calm if she had not seen that time was passing and that if he talked much longer, she would, as she told him with a smile that was tender, obstinate and abashed, 'end by missing the Overture!' On other occasions he told her that the one thing that was more likely than anything else to make him stop loving her was that she would not give up lying. 'Even simply from the point of view of your desire to be attractive, he told her, don't you understand how much of your charm you lose when you stoop to lying? With one confession, think how many faults you could redeem! Really you are much less intelligent than I thought!' But it was in vain that Swann expounded for her thus all the reasons she had for not lying; they might have undermined some general and systematic approach to lying; but Odette had none; she merely contented herself, whenever she wanted Swann not to know about something she had done, with not telling him about it. And so lying was for her an expedient of a particular order; and the only thing that could decide whether she ought to make use of it or confess the truth was a reason of a particular order too, the greater or lesser likelihood that Swann might discover she had not told the truth. Physically, she was going through a bad phase: she was growing stout; and the expressive and doleful charm, the surprised and dreamy glances she had once had seemed to have disappeared with her first youth. So that she had become so dear to Swann at the moment, as it were, when he found her in fact much less pretty. He would look at her for a long time trying to recover the charm he had once seen in her, and he would not find it. But knowing that under the new chrysalis, what lived on was still Odette, still the same will, evanescent, elusive and guileful, was enough to make Swann continue to put the same passion into trying to capture her. Then he would look at a photograph from two years before, he would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him a little for taking such pains over her. When the Verdurins carried her off to Saint-Germain, Chatou, Meulan, often, if it was the warm season, they would propose, on the spot, staying there to sleep and not coming back until the next day. Mme Verdurin would try to quiet the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris. She'll be delighted to be rid of you for a day. And how could she worry, she knows you're with us; anyway, she can put the blame on me. But if she was not successful, M. Verdurin would spring into action, find a telegraph office or a messenger and inquire as to which of the faithful had someone they needed to inform. But Odette would thank him and say that she did not need to send anyone a telegram, because she had told Swann once and for all that by sending him one in front of everybody, she would be compromising herself. Sometimes she would be gone for several days, the Verdurins would take her to see the tombs at Dreux, or, on the advice of the painter, to Compiegne to admire sunsets as viewed from inside a forest, and then they would push on as far as the Chateau de Pierrefonds.73 To think she could visit real historic buildings with me. I've studied architecture for ten years and I'm forever being implored to take people of very high standing to Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud74 and would only do it for her, and instead she goes with the lowest of simpletons to wax ecstatic first over the dejecta of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! It seems to me you don't need to be an artist for that and even without a particularly delicate nose, you don't choose to go holiday-making in latrines in order to be closer to the smell of excrement. But when she had left for Dreux or Pierrefonds without, alas, allowing him to go too, as though by chance, on his own account, because 'that would make a deplorable impression', she said he would plunge into the most intoxicating of romances, the railway time-table, which would show him all the ways he might join her, in the afternoon, in the evening, that same morning! Not only the ways, but even more, almost: the permission. Because after all, the time-table and the trains themselves were not meant for dogs. If one informed the public, via printed matter, that at eight o'clock in the morning a train left which arrived in Pierrefonds",3.423056816730361,1.0631197255447413,0.4170478183609119,0.06176695081610055,4.207391064533922,4.0,2.23397288191693,32.375,31.0,20.3395835924506,1.2702702702702702,1.0,0.5967218628134947,1813,626,0.34528405956977387,7956,56,64.32972018036098,8.670467141167366e+27,4.1584974298164823e+24,0.7944432976570996,0.7828094136935694,66.50951013513516,12.02543918918919,10.9516,15.266602316602317,14.574311913954766,8.025173745173742,48.03964423607281,5.071428571428571,True,1219.0,0.883453237410072,3.8158273381294965,2085.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024087740877408774,0.007380073800738007,0.007380073800738007,0.007380073800738007,0.007380073800738007,0.0,0.007175071750717507,0.004920049200492005,0.0052275522755227555,0.010071942446043165,67,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"at ten o'clock, it was because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette was superfluous; and it was also an act that could have a motive completely different from the desire to meet Odette, since people who did not know her performed it each day, in large enough numbers for it to be worth the trouble of stoking the locomotives. So she really couldn't stop him from going to Pierrefonds if he wanted to! Now, in fact, he felt that he did want to, and that, if he had not known Odette, he certainly would have gone. For a long time now he had wanted to form a clearer idea for himself of Viollet-le-Duc's restoration work. And in this weather, he was moved by an imperious desire for a walk in the forest of Compiegne. It was truly hard luck that she was forbidding him the only spot that tempted him today. Today! If he went despite her prohibition, he might see her today! But whereas, if at Pierrefonds she had met someone who did not matter, she would have said joyfully: 'Imagine finding you here!', and would have asked him to come to see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if she met him, Swann, there, she would be offended, she would say to herself that she was being followed, she would love him less, perhaps she would turn away angrily when she saw him. 'So, I no longer have the right to travel!' she would say to him when they returned, whereas really he was the one who no longer had the right to travel! For a while he had had the idea, so as to be able to go to Compiegne and Pierrefonds without appearing to be doing it in order to meet Odette, of contriving to be taken there by one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a chateau in the vicinity. The Marquis, to whom he had communicated his plan without letting him know the reason for it, was beside himself with joy and marvelled that Swann, for the first time in fifteen years, was at last consenting to come to see his estate and, since he did not want to stay there, as he had told him, at least promised to take walks and go on excursions with him for a few days. Swann pictured himself already down there with M. de Forestelle. Even before seeing Odette there, even if he did not manage to see her there, what happiness it would give him to step on that earth where, not knowing the exact location, at any given moment, of her presence, he would feel palpitating everywhere the possibility of her sudden appearance: in the courtyard of the chateau, now beautiful to him because it was for her sake that he had gone to see it; in every street of the town, which seemed to him romantic; on every road in the forest, rosy in the deep and tender sunset; numberless and alternative asylums, where, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his multiplied heart simultaneously came to take refuge, happy and vagabond. 'Whatever we do, he would say to M. de Forestelle, let's take care we don't stumble on Odette and the Verdurins; I've just learned they're in Pierrefonds today, in fact. There's time enough for us to see one another in Paris, it wouldn't be worth the trouble of leaving Paris if they couldn't take a step without me or I without them.' And his friend would not understand why, once he was there, he would change a plan twenty times, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiegne without making up his mind to sit down in any of them even though not a trace of the Verdurins had been seen, looking as though he were searching for the very thing he had said he wanted to avoid and then avoiding it as soon as he found it, because if he had encountered the little group, he would pointedly have gone off, glad he had seen Odette and that she had seen him, especially that she had seen him not bothering about her. But no, she would certainly guess that it was for her sake that he was there. And when M. de Forestelle came to pick him up so that they could leave, he said to him: 'Alas, no, I can't go to Pierrefonds today, Odette is there, as it turns out.' And Swann was happy despite everything to feel that, if alone of all mortals that day he was not allowed to go to Pierrefonds, it was because for Odette he was in fact someone different from the others, her lover, and that this restriction which was applied in his case alone to the universal right to freedom of movement was merely one of the forms of that slavery, of that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly it was better not to risk quarrelling with her, to be patient, to wait for her to come back. He spent his days bent over a map of the Compiegne forest as if it were the Map of Love,75 and surrounded himself with photographs of the chateau at Pierrefonds. As soon as the day arrived on which it was possible that she would be coming back, he opened the time-table again, calculated which train she must have taken and, if she had been delayed, those that were still available for her. He did not go out for fear of missing a telegram, did not go to bed in case, having returned on the last train, she wanted to surprise him by coming to see him in the middle of the night. In fact he heard the bell at the carriage gate, it seemed to him they were slow opening it, he wanted to wake up the concierge, went to the window to call out to Odette if it was she, for despite the instructions he had gone downstairs to give the servants himself more than ten times, they were still capable of telling her he was not there. It was a servant coming home. He noticed the incessant stream of the passing carriages, to which he had never paid attention in the past. He listened to each one come from far off, draw near, pass his gate without stopping and go on into the distance bearing a message that was not for him. He waited all night, quite uselessly, for the Verdurins had decided to return early, and Odette had been in Paris since noon; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do, she had gone and spent her evening alone at the theatre and long ago, by now, she had returned home to bed and gone to sleep. The fact was that she had not even thought of him. And occasions such as this when she forgot Swann's very existence were more useful to Odette, did more to attach Swann to her, than all her coquetry. Because in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had already been powerful enough to make his love blossom on the night when he had not found Odette at the Verdurins' and had searched for her all evening. And he did not have, as I had at Combray in my childhood, happy days during which to forget the sufferings that will return at night. Swann spent his days without Odette; and now and then he said to himself that to allow such a pretty woman to go out alone in Paris like that was as imprudent as to put a case full of jewels in the middle of the street. Then he would become indignant at all the people passing by as at so many thieves. But their faces, formless, collective, escaped the grasp of his imagination and did not feed his jealousy. Swann's mind would become exhausted, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he would exclaim: 'We must trust in God,' like those who, after having persisted in embracing the problem of the reality of the external world or the immortality of the soul, grant their tired brains the relief of an act of faith. But always the thought of the absent woman was indissolubly mingled with the simplest actions of Swann's life having lunch, receiving his mail, leaving the house, going to bed by the very sadness he felt over performing them without her, like the initials of Philibert le Beau, which, in the church at Brou,76 because of the longing she felt for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On certain days, instead of staying at home, he would go and have his lunch in a restaurant not far from his house whose good cooking he had appreciated once upon a time and to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and preposterous, that we call romantic; the fact was that this restaurant (which still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: Laperouse.77 Sometimes, when she had gone away briefly, it was only after several days that she thought of letting him know she had returned to Paris. And she would say to him quite simply, no longer taking the precaution as she once had of covering herself, just in case, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just returned that moment by the morning train. These words were mendacious; at least for Odette they were mendacious, insubstantial, not having, as they would have had if they had been true, a basis in her memory of her arrival at the station; in fact, she was even kept from picturing them to herself at the moment she uttered them, by the contradictory image of what she had been doing that was quite different at the moment she was claiming she had got off the train. But in Swann's mind it was just the opposite, these words, encountering no obstacle, encrusted themselves and assumed the immobility of a truth so indubitable that if a friend told him he had come by that train and had not seen Odette Swann would be convinced it was the friend who was mistaken about the day or the hour, since his account did not agree with what Odette had said. Her words would have seemed to him false only if he had suspected beforehand that they were. For him to believe she was lying, a previous suspicion was a necessary condition. In fact it was also a sufficient condition. Then everything Odette said to him would appear suspect. If he heard her mention",3.253453196121717,0.9835176598748869,0.42564409947786214,0.05897228161055951,4.199556541019955,4.0,2.243265314489875,36.816326530612244,27.0,28.002677327820475,1.2361419068736141,1.0,0.5764231148704013,1804,554,0.3070953436807095,7833,49,61.367234650090296,4.481788709455572e+26,2.2034359436851388e+23,0.8048771601170301,0.7955201319716079,64.88882324992085,13.354841848047425,11.249258249689472,16.92165256346441,16.758074573510108,8.089401330376937,52.78084981220869,5.877551020408164,True,1197.0,0.8942969518190758,3.8510324483775813,2034.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0271981729471608,0.005605730302086578,0.005605730302086578,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009342883836810962,0.006228589224540642,0.004982871379632514,0.006391347099311701,68,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"a name, it was certainly the name of one of her lovers; the supposition once forged, he would spend weeks grieving; he even had an interview once with a private investigation agency in order to find out the address and the daily routine of the stranger who would not let him breathe easily except when he went off on a trip, and who, he learned in the end, was an uncle of Odette's dead for the past twenty years. Even though in general she did not permit him to meet her in public places, saying that people would talk, sometimes at an evening party to which he and she both had been invited at Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball in one of the ministries he would find himself there at the same time as she. He saw her but did not dare stay for fear of irritating her by appearing to spy on the pleasures she was enjoying with other people, pleasures which as he drove home alone, went to bed as anxious as I myself was to be some years later on the evenings when he would come to dine at the house, at Combray seemed boundless to him because he had not seen them come to an end. And once or twice on such evenings he experienced the sort of happiness which, if it had not been so violently affected by the recoil from the abrupt cessation of anxiety, one would be tempted to call a tranquil happiness, because it consisted of a return to a peaceful state of mind: he had dropped in on a party at the painter's home and was preparing to go off again; behind him he was leaving Odette transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to speak of some sensuous pleasure that would be enjoyed there or elsewhere (maybe at the 'Bal des Incoherents'78 where he trembled at the idea that she would go afterwards) and that caused Swann more jealousy than the carnal act itself because he had more difficulty imagining it; he was already on the point of passing through the studio door, when he heard himself being called back with these words (which, by cutting off from the party that end which had terrified him so, made the party seem in retrospect innocent, made Odette's return a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but sweet and familiar and abiding next to him, like a bit of his everyday life, in his carriage, and divested Odette herself of her too brilliant and too gay appearance, showed that it was only a disguise which she had put on for a moment, for its own sake, not with a view to mysterious pleasures, and that she was already tired of it), with these words that Odette tossed at him, as he was already on the threshold: 'Wouldn't you wait five minutes for me? I'm leaving, we'll go back together, you can take me home. True, one day Forcheville had asked to be taken back at the same time but, when they had arrived at Odette's door and he had asked permission to come in too, Odette had answered him, pointing to Swann: 'Ah! That depends on this gentleman here, ask him. Well, all right, come in for a moment if you want, but not for long because I warn you he likes to talk quietly with me, and he doesn't much like having visitors when he comes. If you knew that creature as well as I know him! Isn't that so, my love,79 I'm the only one who really knows you?' And Swann was perhaps even more touched to see her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only these tender words of predilection, but also certain criticisms such as: 'I'm sure you haven't answered your friends yet about that dinner on Sunday. Don't go if you don't want to, but at least be polite,' or: 'Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here so that you can do a little more of it tomorrow? How lazy you are! I'll make you work you'll see!', which proved that Odette kept up with his social engagements and his literary work, that the two of them really had a life together. And as she said this she gave him a smile in the depths of which he felt she was entirely his. And so at these moments, while she was making orangeade for them, suddenly, as when a badly regulated reflector first casts around an object, on the wall, large fantastic shadows, which then fold and disappear into it, all the terrible shifting ideas he had formed for himself about Odette would vanish, would rejoin the charming body that stood there in front of him. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent at Odette's house, in the lamplight, was perhaps not an artificial hour, invented for his own use (intended to mask that dismaying and delightful thing which he thought about endlessly without being able really to picture it, an hour in Odette's real life, in Odette's life when he himself was not there), with stage-set accessories and cardboard fruit, but was perhaps a real hour in Odette's life, that if he had not been there, she would have set out the same armchair for Forcheville and poured him not some unfamiliar drink, but that very same orangeade, that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other frightful and supernatural world where he spent his time locating her and which perhaps existed only in his imagination, but rather the real world, radiating no special sadness, comprising that table where he was going to be able to write and that drink which he would be permitted to taste, all those objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if by absorbing his dreams they had delivered him from them, they in return had been enriched by them, they showed him the palpable realization of his dreams, and they interested his mind, they assumed substance and shape before his eyes at the same time that they soothed his heart. If fate had permitted him to have but a single home with Odette so that in her house he would be in his own, if when he asked the servant what was planned for lunch, it was Odette's menu that he had learned in answer, if when Odette wanted to go out in the morning to walk down the avenue du Bois de Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, even if he did not want to go out, to accompany her, carrying her coat when she was too warm, and at night after dinner if she wanted to stay at home informally dressed, if he had been forced to stay there with her, to do what she wanted; then how completely all those trifles in Swann's life which seemed to him so sad, would, on the contrary, because they were at the same time part of Odette's life, have taken on, even the most familiar of them like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair which contained so much of his dreams, which materialized so much desire a sort of superabundant sweetness and mysterious density. Yet he actually suspected that what he thus longed for was a calm, a peace that would not have been a favourable atmosphere for his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, longed for, imaginary, when the feeling he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance caused in him by the phrase from the sonata, but affection, gratitude, when normal relations were established between them that would put an end to his madness and his gloom, then no doubt the actions of Odette's daily life would appear to him of little interest in themselves as he had several times already suspected they were, for example on the day when he had read through its envelope the letter addressed to Forcheville. Considering his disease with as much discernment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study it, he told himself that when he had recovered his health what Odette might be doing would leave him indifferent. But, from within his morbid state, in truth he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would in fact have been the death of all that he was at present. After these peaceful evenings, Swann's suspicions would be calmed; he would bless Odette and the next day, first thing in the morning, he would send around to her house the most beautiful jewels, because those kind attentions the night before had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love that needed to expend itself. But at other times his grief overcame him again, he imagined that Odette was Forcheville's mistress and that when the two of them had seen him, from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, at the Bois, the day before the Chatou party to which he had not been invited, entreat her vainly, with that look of despair which even his coachman had noticed, to go back with him, then return home on his own, alone and defeated, she must have had, as she pointed him out to Forcheville and said to him: 'Look! How furious he is!' the same expression in her eyes, glittering, malicious, haughty and sly, as on the day when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins' house. Then Swann detested her. 'But also, I'm too stupid, he would tell himself, I'm paying with my own money for other people's pleasures. All the same, she ought to take care and not pull too hard on her bowstring, because I might very well not give anything more at all. In any case, let's forgo the supplementary favours for the time being! To think that only yesterday, when she said she wanted to attend the season at Bayreuth,80 I was stupid enough to propose renting for the two of us one of the King of Bavaria's pretty castles in the vicinity. And anyway she did not seem all that delighted, she hasn't yet said either yes or no; let's hope she will decide against it. Good Lord! To spend two weeks listening to Wagner with her when she cares as much for it as a fish for an apple what fun that would be!' And because his hatred, like his love, needed to manifest itself and to act, he took pleasure in pursuing his evil fantasies farther and farther, since, because of the perfidies he imputed to Odette, he",3.4374806627307124,1.3691511568732544,0.43186127121690027,0.07951113700307083,4.279844530816213,4.0,2.2511590396759713,51.457142857142856,33.0,62.28705109967784,1.2543031649083842,1.0,0.6078923595100303,1801,605,0.3359244863964464,8017,35,58.407335814219465,2.3226493361220084e+25,1.1318953879736884e+22,0.7520544397480348,0.7355182486953158,48.49195224875072,19.279063060204653,13.070873081296916,22.937104783057034,24.45663916871579,8.790249861188226,67.83693186325057,8.428571428571429,True,1209.0,0.895224171539961,3.9069200779727096,2052.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004278292757461546,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008556585514923092,0.004482020984007335,0.006519303249465213,0.007797270955165692,69,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"detested her still more and could, if something he tried to picture to himself they were found to be true, have an occasion for punishing her and for satiating on her his increasing rage. Thus he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her in which she would ask him for money to rent that castle near Bayreuth, but warning him that he could not go there himself, because she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins that she would invite them. How he would have liked her to be so bold! What joy he would feel as he refused, as he drafted the vengeful answer, the terms of which he took satisfaction in choosing, in uttering out loud, as if he had actually received the letter! Yet, this was in fact what happened the very next day. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to attend these performances of Wagner and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would at last, after having so often been entertained at their home, have the pleasure of inviting them in her turn. About him, she said not a word, it was implied that their presence would exclude his own. And so that terrible answer, whose every word he had determined the day before without daring to hope that it would ever be used, he could now have the joy of sending off to her. Alas! He was quite aware that, all the same, with the money she had, or that she might easily find, she could rent something at Bayreuth since she wanted to, she who was incapable of telling the difference between Bach and Clapisson.81 But still, she would live there more meanly. There would be no way, as there would have been had he sent her a few thousand-franc bills this time, of organizing every evening, in a castle, those exquisite suppers after which she would perhaps have indulged the whim which it was possible she had never yet had of falling into Forcheville's arms. And then at least he, Swann, was not the one who would be paying for this detested journey! Oh, if only he could have prevented it! if only she could have sprained her ankle before she left, if the coachman of the carriage that would take her to the station had agreed, at no matter what price, to drive her to a place where for some time she would remain sequestered this perfidious woman, her eyes enamelled by a smile of complicity addressed to Forcheville, which Odette had become for Swann in the past forty-eight hours! But she was never that for very long; after a few days the gleaming, hypocritical gaze would lose some of its lustre and duplicity, the image of a despised Odette saying to Forcheville: 'How furious he is!' would begin to grow pale, fade away. Then, gradually the face of the other Odette would reappear and rise up, shining softly, the Odette who also offered a smile to Forcheville, but a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: 'Don't stay long, because this gentleman does not much like me to have visitors when he wants to be with me. Oh, if you knew this creature as well as I know him!', the same smile she wore when thanking Swann for some instance of his courtesy, which she prized so highly, for some advice she had asked of him in one of those serious circumstances in which she had confidence only in him. Then, thinking of this Odette, he would ask himself how he could have written her that outrageous letter of which no doubt until now she had not thought him capable, and which must have brought him down from the high, the unique rank which by his goodness, his honesty, he had won in her esteem. He would now become less dear to her, because it was for those particular qualities, which she did not find in either Forcheville or any other man, that she loved him. It was because of them that Odette so often showed a graciousness towards him that he counted for nothing when he was jealous, because it was not a sign of desire, and even gave proof of affection rather than love, but whose importance he began to feel again in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, a relaxation often increased by the distraction he found in reading about art or talking to a friend, caused his passion to become less demanding of reciprocities. Now that, after this oscillation, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for a time removed her, to the angle from which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent, and so pretty thus that he could not help offering her his lips as if she had been there and he had been able to kiss her; and he felt as strong a gratitude towards her for this enchanting, kindly glance as if she had really given it to him, as if it were not merely his imagination that had just portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire. How he must have hurt her! Of course he could find valid reasons for his resentment against her, but they would not have been enough to make him feel that resentment if he had not loved her so much. Had he not had grievances of equal gravity against other women, for whom he would nevertheless readily have done favours now, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If some day he was ever to find himself in the same state of indifference towards Odette, he would understand that it was his jealousy alone that had made him find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire of hers, fundamentally so natural, arising from a slight childishness and also a certain delicacy of soul, to be able in her turn, since an occasion presented itself, to repay some of the civilities of the Verdurins, play mistress of the house. He returned to this point of view which was opposed to that of his love and his jealousy, and in which he placed himself sometimes through a sort of intellectual equity in order to allow for the various probabilities from which he tried to judge Odette as if he had never loved her, as if to him she were a woman like any other, as if Odette's life had not been, as soon as he was no longer there, different, contrived in hiding from him, plotted against him. Why should he believe that there, she would enjoy with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never experienced with him and which his jealousy alone had fabricated out of nothing? In Bayreuth as in Paris, if Forcheville happened to think of him, it might be merely as of someone who mattered a great deal in Odette's life, to whom he was obliged to yield his place, when they met at her house. If Forcheville and she gloated over being there despite him, it was he who would be to blame for it by trying uselessly to prevent her from going, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which was in fact defensible, she would have appeared to be there on his recommendation, she would feel she had been sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure she felt in entertaining those people who had entertained her so often, it was to Swann that she would have been grateful. And instead of letting her go off on bad terms with him, without having seen him again if he sent her this money, if he encouraged her to take this trip and went out of his way to make it pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy of seeing her, a joy which he had not experienced for almost a week and which nothing could replace. Because as soon as Swann could picture her without horror, as soon as he again saw kindness in her smile, and as soon as the desire to take her out of reach of all other men was not added by jealousy to his love, that love again became above all a predilection for the sensations that Odette's person gave him, for the pleasure he took in admiring like a spectacle or questioning like a phenomenon the dawn of one of her glances, the evolution of one of her smiles, the emission of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from all the others, had ended by creating in him a need for her that she alone could satisfy by her presence or her letters, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse, as another need that characterized this new period in Swann's life, in which the dryness, the depression of earlier years had been succeeded by a sort of spiritual over-fullness, without his knowing to what it was that he owed this unhoped-for enrichment of his inner life any more than does a person of delicate health who at a certain moment begins to grow stronger, stouter, and seems for some time to be on the path to a complete recovery: that other need which was also developing apart from the real world was the need to hear, and to know, music. And so, with the very chemistry of his disease, after he had created jealousy with his love, he began again to manufacture affection, pity for Odette. She had turned back into the Odette who was charming and good. He felt remorse at having been severe towards her. He wanted her to come to him, and, before that, he wanted to procure her some sort of pleasure, so as to see gratitude mould her face and shape her smile. And Odette, sure of seeing him come after a few days, as tender and submissive as before, to ask her for a reconciliation, acquired the habit of no longer being afraid of displeasing him or even provoking him and she refused him, when it was convenient for her, the favours he valued most. Perhaps she did not realize how sincere he had been with her during the quarrel, when he had told her he would not send her any money and would try to hurt her. Perhaps she also did not realize how sincere he was, if not with her, at least with himself, on other occasions when for the sake of the future of their relationship, so as",3.735037187157966,1.1073206162944118,0.43414577260895815,0.068615554617979,4.2797783933518,4.0,2.32339801675096,46.282051282051285,35.0,31.205644392418627,1.2770083102493075,1.0,0.631357787978128,1805,569,0.3152354570637119,7940,39,57.21700487300045,7.063655128692467e+24,3.510762986427668e+21,0.8421652546446574,0.8240824601537472,51.82381490162655,17.52869806094183,12.457975602129121,20.817529654094756,21.86878187371262,8.725540166204983,62.957951559059595,7.717948717948718,True,1227.0,0.9005964214711729,3.9463220675944335,2012.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009240246406570842,0.006160164271047228,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010164271047227925,0.006776180698151951,0.0,0.007455268389662028,70,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to show Odette he was capable of doing without her, that a break was always possible, he decided to let some time pass without going to see her. Sometimes this was after several days during which she had not given him any new reason to worry; and since, from the next few visits he would make to her, he knew he would not derive any very great joy but more probably some vexation that would put an end to his present state of calm, he would write to her that since he was very busy he would not be able to see her on any of the days on which he had said he would. Then a letter from her, crossing his, would ask him to change one of those very meetings. He would wonder why; his suspicions, his anguish would take hold of him again. He would no longer be able to abide, in the new state of agitation in which he found himself, by the commitment he had made in his earlier state of relative calm, he would hurry to her house and demand to see her on all the following days. And even if she had not written to him first, if she merely answered, with an acquiescence, his request for a brief separation, this would be enough to make him unable to go on without seeing her. For, contrary to Swann's calculations, Odette's consent had entirely changed his attitude. Like all those who enjoy the possession of a thing, in order to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it he had removed that thing from his mind, leaving everything else in the same state as when the thing was there. But the absence of a thing is not merely that, it is not simply a partial lack, it is a disruption of everything else, it is a new state which one cannot foresee in the old. But there were other occasions Odette was about to go off on a trip when, after some little dispute for which he had chosen the pretext, he would resolve not to write to her and not to see her again before she returned, thus giving the appearance, and expecting the reward, of a more serious quarrel, which she would perhaps believe was final, to a separation the greater part of which was unavoidable because of the trip and which he was merely allowing to begin a little earlier. Already he imagined Odette uneasy, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter, and this image, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. No doubt, at times, at the far end of his mind where his resolution had thrust her because of the entire interposed length of the three weeks of separation he had accepted, it was with pleasure that he contemplated the idea that he would see Odette again when she returned; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself if he would not readily double the duration of an abstinence that was so easy. It had lasted as yet only three days, a period of time much shorter than he had often spent without seeing Odette and without having as now planned it in advance. And yet at this point a slight irritation or physical discomfort by inciting him to consider the present moment as an exceptional moment, outside the rules, one in which even common wisdom would agree that he could accept the appeasement afforded by a pleasure and allow his will, until it might be useful to resume the effort, to rest would suspend the action of the latter, which would cease to exert its compression; or, less than that, the memory of something he had forgotten to ask Odette, whether she had decided which colour she wanted to have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to a certain investment, whether it was ordinary or preferred shares that she wanted to buy (it was all very well to show her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the painting had to be done all over again or the shares paid no dividends, a lot of good it would have done him), and like a stretched rubber band that is let go or the air in a pneumatic machine that is opened, the idea of seeing her again would spring back from the far distance where it had been kept into the field of the present as an immediate possibility. It came back without encountering any further resistance, and was in fact so irresistible that Swann had had much less difficulty feeling the approach one by one of the fifteen days he was going to be separated from Odette than he had waiting the ten minutes which his coachman took to harness the carriage that was going to take him to her house and which he spent in transports of impatience and joy, seizing over and over a thousand times, in order to lavish his tenderness on it, the idea of meeting her again, which, by so abrupt a return, at the moment when he thought it was so far away, was once again with him in his closest consciousness. For this thought no longer encountered the obstacle of Swann's desire to attempt forthwith to resist it, a desire which had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to himself at least this was what he believed that he was so easily capable of it, he no longer saw any disadvantage in deferring an attempt at separation that he was now certain he could put into execution whenever he wished. And, too, this idea of seeing her again returned to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, endowed with a virulence which habit had dulled, but which had been retempered in that privation not of three days but of fifteen (for a period of renunciation must be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been until then an expected pleasure which could easily be sacrificed into an unhoped-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to Swann embellished by his ignorance of what Odette might have thought, perhaps done, seeing that he had given her no sign of life, so that what he was now going to find was the impassioning revelation of an Odette almost unknown to him. But just as she had believed that his refusal of the money was only a sham, she saw nothing but a pretext in the information that Swann came to ask of her about the carriage to be repainted or the shares to be purchased. For she could not reconstruct the various phases of these crises through which he was passing and, in the notion she had formed of them, she did not understand the mechanism by which they worked, and looked only to what she knew beforehand, to their necessary, infallible and always identical termination. A notion that was incomplete and therefore all the more profound, perhaps if one judged it from the point of view of Swann, who would no doubt have thought he was misunderstood by Odette, just as a morphine addict or a consumptive, persuaded that they have been prevented, one by an outside event just when he was about to free himself of his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition just when he was about to be restored to health at last, feel misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance they do to these alleged contingencies, mere disguises according to him, assumed, so as to make themselves perceptible again to his patients, by the vice and the morbid condition which, in reality, have not ceased to burden them incurably while they were feeding their dreams of reformation or recovery. And in fact, Swann's love had reached the stage where the doctor and, in certain affections, even the boldest surgeon, ask themselves if ridding a patient of his vice or relieving him of his disease is still reasonable or even possible. Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct awareness. When he tried to measure it, it sometimes seemed to him diminished, reduced to almost nothing; for example, the lack of pleasure, the displeasure, almost, inspired in him, before he loved Odette, by her expressive features, her faded complexion, came back to him on certain days. 'Really, I'm making some progress, he would say to himself the next day; when I think about it carefully, I hardly enjoyed myself at all yesterday when I was in bed with her: it's odd, I actually found her ugly.' And of course, he was sincere, but his love extended well beyond the realms of physical desire. Odette's body itself no longer had a large place in it. When his eyes fell upon Odette's photograph on the table, or when she came to see him, he had trouble identifying the figure of flesh or cardboard with the painful and constant disturbance that inhabited him. He would say to himself almost with surprise: 'It's she!' as if suddenly we were shown in a separate, external form one of our own diseases and found that it did not resemble what we were suffering. 'She' he tried to ask himself what that was; for what love and death have in common, more than those vague qualities that people are always talking about, is that they make us question more deeply, for fear that its reality will slip away from us, the mystery of personality. And this disease which was Swann's love had so proliferated, it was so closely entangled with all Swann's habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he wanted after his death, it was now so much a part of him, that it could not have been torn from him without destroying him almost entirely: as they say in surgery, his love was no longer operable. By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that, when by chance he reappeared in society telling himself that his connections, like an elegant setting that she would not in fact have been able to appreciate with much accuracy, could restore a little of his value in Odette's eyes (and this would perhaps indeed have been true had these connections not been lowered in value by that love itself, which for Odette depreciated all the things it touched by seeming to proclaim them less precious), what he experienced there, along with the distress of being in",3.701675724810077,1.2881765072711548,0.42096177737713825,0.09327398839525013,4.376039933444259,4.0,2.3734813488470685,53.029411764705884,42.5,42.79670499556606,1.3105934553521907,1.0,0.6569174830913781,1803,590,0.32723239046034386,8111,34,58.96597819411881,4.0606817135821265e+25,2.0192350639393964e+22,0.8322959596460516,0.8350018963683397,42.13394073602822,20.556473361391145,13.8614814582182,23.87399432318685,25.695853968875404,9.372933998890733,71.38770350070145,9.735294117647058,True,1201.0,0.9030333167578319,4.0333167578319244,2011.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009888003228735748,0.0050448996064978305,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007870043386136616,0.004035919685198264,0.0,0.0014917951268025858,71,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"places and among people whom she did not know, was the disinterested pleasure he would have taken in a novel or a painting which depicted the amusements of a leisured class, just as, in his own house, he enjoyed contemplating the functioning of his domestic life, the elegance of his wardrobe and livery, the proper placement of his stocks, in the same way that he enjoyed reading in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, about the 'mechanics' of Mme de Maintenon's daily life,82 her meals, about the shrewd avarice and grand style of Lully.83 And to the small extent that this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure that Swann was enjoying was that he could emigrate for a while into the rare parts of himself that had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality which my great-aunt attributed to him, of 'young Swann', distinct from his more individual personality of Charles Swann, was the one in which he was now happiest. One day when, for the birthday of the Princess of Parma (and because she could often please Odette indirectly by making it possible for her to have seats at galas, jubilees, and other occasions), he had wanted to send her some fruit and was not sure how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother's, a lady who, delighted to do an errand for him, had written to him, when sending him the account, that she had not got all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes at Crapote's, whose specialty they were, the strawberries at Jauret's, the pears at Chevet's, where they were the loveliest, etc., 'each piece of fruit inspected and examined individually by me'. And indeed, from the Princess's thanks, he had been able to judge the flavour of the strawberries and the mellowness of the pears. But more importantly, that 'each piece of fruit inspected and examined individually by me' had soothed his pain, by taking his consciousness away into a region where he rarely went, even though it was his by right as the heir to a rich and solid bourgeois family in which had been preserved by heredity, quite ready to be put at his service whenever he wished, a knowledge of the 'best addresses' and the art of placing a proper order. Certainly, he had forgotten he was 'young Swann' for too long not to feel, when he became that person again briefly, a keener pleasure than those he might have felt at other times and which had palled; and if the friendliness of the bourgeoisie, for whom he had remained that person more than anything else, was less keen than that of the aristocracy (but in fact more flattering, for with them at least it is always inseparable from respect), a letter from a royal personage, whatever princely entertainment it offered, could never be as pleasant to him as a letter asking him to be a witness, or merely to be present, at a wedding in the family of old friends of his parents, some of whom had continued to see him like my grandfather, who, the year before, had invited him to my mother's wedding while certain others barely knew him personally but believed they were obligated to be polite to the son, to the worthy successor, of the late M. Swann. But, because of the already long-standing close ties he had among them, the nobility, to a certain extent, were also part of his house, his household and his family. He felt, when contemplating his distinguished friendships, the same external support, the same comfort, as when looking at the beautiful lands, the beautiful silverware, the beautiful table linen, that had come to him from his own people. And the thought that if he were to collapse at home from the effects of a sudden illness it would quite naturally be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duke of Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus whom his valet would run off to find, brought him the same consolation as to our old Francoise the knowledge that she would be wrapped in a shroud of her own fine sheets, marked, not mended (or so finely that it gave only a loftier idea of the care of the seamstress), a shroud from the frequent image of which in her mind's eye she derived a certain satisfactory sense, if not of material well-being, at least of self-respect. But most importantly, since in every one of his actions and thoughts that referred to Odette, Swann was constantly governed and directed by the unavowed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but less welcome to her than anyone else, than the most boring faithful of the Verdurins when he returned to a world in which he was the highest example of excellence, whom one would do anything to attract, whom one was sorry not to see, he began to believe again in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been bedridden for months, on a strict diet, and who sees in a newspaper the menu for an official luncheon or an advertisement for a cruise to Sicily. If he was obliged to give his excuses to the society people for not visiting them, it was precisely for his visits to her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He even paid for them (asking himself at the end of the month, supposing he had abused her patience somewhat and gone to see her many times, if it was enough to send her four thousand francs), and for each one found a pretext, a present to bring her, a piece of information she needed, M. de Charlus, whom he had met going to her house and who had demanded that he accompany him. And lacking one, he would ask M. de Charlus if he would please run over to her house, remark to her as though spontaneously, in the course of the conversation, that he remembered he had something to say to Swann, would she kindly send for him to come to her house right away; but most often Swann would wait in vain and M. de Charlus would tell him in the evening that his plan had not succeeded. So that if she was often away from Paris now, even when she stayed there she saw very little of him, and she who, when she was in love with him, used to say: 'I'm always free' and 'What do I care what others think?', now, each time he wanted to see her, would invoke social conventions or plead other engagements. When he mentioned that he might be going to some charity ball, opening, premiere where she would be, she would tell him that he was trying to flaunt their affair, that he was treating her like a prostitute. It reached such a point that, in order to try not to be debarred from meeting her anywhere, Swann, knowing that she was acquainted with and had considerable affection for my Great-uncle Adolphe and having once been a friend of his himself, went to see him one day in his little apartment in the rue de Bellechasse to ask him to use his influence with Odette. Since she always adopted poetical airs when speaking to Swann of my uncle, saying: 'Ah, yes, he's not like you, his friendship with me is a lovely thing, so grand, so handsome! He would never think so little of me as to want to show himself with me in every public place,' Swann was perplexed and did not know quite how lofty his tone ought to be in talking about her to my uncle. He posited first Odette's a priori excellence, her axiomatic and seraphic superhumanity, the revealed truth of her virtues, which could neither be demonstrated nor derived from experience. 'I must talk to you. You know that Odette is a woman superior to all other women, an adorable creature, an angel. But you know what life in Paris is like. Not everyone sees Odette in the same light as you and I. And so there are people who think the role I'm playing is rather ridiculous; she can't even allow me to meet her outside, at the theatre. She has such confidence in you couldn't you say a few words to her for me, assure her that she's exaggerating the harm I would do her by greeting her in public?' My uncle advised Swann to let a little time go by without seeing Odette, who would only love him the more for it, and Odette to allow Swann to meet her wherever he liked. A few days later, Odette told Swann she had just had the disappointment of discovering that my uncle was the same as every other man: he had just tried to take her by force. She quieted Swann when at first he wanted to go off and challenge my uncle, but he refused to shake his hand the next time he met him. He regretted this quarrel with my Uncle Adolphe all the more since he had hoped, had he seen him again from time to time and been able to chat with him in complete confidence, to try to shed some light on certain rumours relating to the life Odette had once led in Nice. For my Uncle Adolphe spent his winters there. And Swann thought that perhaps it was even there that he had met Odette. The little that had been let slip by someone in his presence, relating to a man who was said to have been Odette's lover, had greatly disturbed Swann. But the things he would have regarded, before knowing them, as the most frightful to learn and the most impossible to believe, once he knew them were incorporated for ever after into his sadness, he accepted them, he would no longer have been able to understand that they did not exist. Only each one indelibly revised the idea he was forming of his mistress. He was even given to understand, at one point, that this laxness in Odette's morals, which he would not have suspected, was fairly well known, and that in Baden and in Nice, when she used to spend a few months there, she had had a sort of amorous notoriety. He sought out certain womanizers in order to question them; but they were aware that he knew Odette; and besides, he was afraid of reminding them of her, of putting them on her track. But he to whom before then nothing could have appeared as tedious as anything",3.6858465630590826,1.1706004549596625,0.4282551717130314,0.05264353366037154,4.2606530160487,4.0,2.323603344177786,48.83783783783784,34.0,40.66974007154726,1.2800221361372441,1.0,0.6251989386163528,1807,631,0.3491975650249032,7965,37,63.00742119925959,2.3108691020303204e+27,1.1250579854091141e+24,0.850487556722429,0.863336341721671,48.97472187738376,18.561017963176237,13.023866798666859,21.992246369224787,23.0565946245083,8.64655229662424,65.66130214331653,8.216216216216216,True,1163.0,0.8880233690360273,3.877799415774099,2054.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012903225806451613,0.012903225806451613,0.012903225806451613,0.012903225806451613,0.012903225806451613,0.012903225806451613,0.007168458781362007,0.003277009728622632,0.0,0.0038948393378773127,72,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"relating to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or Nice, learning that Odette had perhaps led a rather riotous life in those pleasure towns, though he could never manage to find out if it had been only to satisfy a need for money which thanks to him she no longer had, or from some capricious desire which might return, now leaned with an impotent, blind and dizzying anguish over the bottomless abyss that had swallowed up those early years of the Septennate84 during which one spent winters on the Promenade des Anglais, summers under the limes of Baden, and in them he saw a painful but magnificent profundity such as a poet might have lent them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of the petty events of the chronicle of the Cote d'Azur of that time, if that chronicle could have helped him understand something of Odette's smile or the look in her eyes honest and simple though they were more passion than an aesthete examining the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence in order to try to penetrate farther into the soul of Botticelli's Primavera, bella Vanna or Venus.85 Often, without saying anything to her, he would gaze at her, he would day-dream; she would say to him: 'How sad you look!' It was not as yet very long since he had moved on from the idea that she was a good person, comparable to the best he had ever known, to the idea that she was a kept woman; inversely he had sometimes since then returned from Odette de Crecy, perhaps too well known among the fast crowd, among ladies'-men, to this face whose expression was at times so gentle, to this nature so human. He would say to himself: 'What does it matter that at Nice everyone knows Odette de Crecy? Reputations of this sort, even if true, are created out of other people's ideas'; he would reflect that this legend even if it was authentic lay outside Odette, was not inside her like an irreducible and baneful personality; that the creature who might have been led to do wrong was a woman with kind eyes, a heart full of pity for suffering, a docile body which he had held, which he had clasped in his arms and handled, a woman whom one day he might come to possess entirely, if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. She was there, often tired, her face emptied for a moment of that feverish, joyful preoccupation with the unknown things that made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with her hands; her forehead, her face would appear broader; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some good feeling such as may be found in all individuals when in a moment of rest or reclusion they are left to themselves, would spring from her eyes like a beam of yellow sunlight. And immediately her whole face would brighten like a grey countryside covered with clouds which suddenly part, transfiguring it, at the moment the sun goes down. The life that was in Odette at that moment, even the future she seemed so dreamily to be watching, Swann could have shared with her; no evil disturbance seemed to have left its residue there. Rare though they became, these moments were not entirely useless. In memory Swann joined these fragments together, eliminated the intervals, cast, as though in gold, an Odette formed of goodness and calm for whom (as will be seen in the second part of this story) he later made sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But these moments were so rare, and he saw her so little now! Even in the case of their evening meeting, she told him only at the last minute if she could grant it to him, for, since she could count on his always being free, she first wanted to be certain that no one else would suggest coming around. She maintained that she had to wait for an answer of the greatest importance, and if after she had sent for Swann friends asked Odette, when the evening had already begun, to meet them at the theatre or at supper, she would give a joyful leap into the air and dress quickly. As she progressed in her preparations, each movement she made would bring Swann closer to the moment when he would have to leave her, when she would fly off with an irresistible force; and when ready at last, plunging into her mirror a final glance strained and brightened by attention, she put a little more red on her lips, settled a lock of hair on her forehead and asked for her sky-blue evening cloak with gold tassels, Swann looked so sad that she could not suppress a gesture of impatience and said: 'So that's how you thank me for letting you stay here till the last minute. And I thought I was doing something nice. I'll know better next time!' Now and then, at the risk of angering her, he would promise himself to try to find out where she had gone, he would dream of an alliance with Forcheville, who would perhaps have been able to enlighten him. In any case, when he knew who it was she had spent the evening with, it was very seldom that he could not discover among all his own acquaintance someone who knew, if only indirectly, the man with whom she had gone out and could easily obtain this or that information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends to ask him to try to clear up this or that point, he would feel how restful it was to stop asking himself his unanswerable questions and to be transferring to someone else the fatigue of interrogation. True, Swann was scarcely better off when he had certain information. Knowing a thing does not always mean preventing a thing, but at least the things we know, we hold, if not in our hands, at least in our minds where we can arrange them as we like, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power over them. He was happy each time M. de Charlus was with Odette. Between M. de Charlus and her, Swann knew that nothing could happen, that when M. de Charlus went out with her it was for the sake of his friendship with Swann and he would have no reluctance about telling him what she had done. Sometimes she had declared so categorically to Swann that it was impossible for her to see him on a certain evening, she seemed so keen on going out, that Swann attached real importance to M. de Charlus's being free to go with her. The next day, though he did not dare ask many questions of M. de Charlus, he would compel him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him further answers, after each of which he would feel more relieved, because he very soon learned that Odette had occupied her evening with pleasures that were most innocent. 'But what do you mean, my dear Meme? I don't quite understand... You didn't go straight from her house to the Musee Grevin? You had gone somewhere else first. No? Oh! How funny! You don't know how much you amuse me, my dear Meme. But what a funny idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards, that's certainly her sort of idea... No? It was you? How strange. But in fact it's not such a bad idea; she must have known a good many people there? No? She spoke to no one? That's extraordinary. So you stayed there like that just the two of you all by yourselves? I can just picture it. You are kind, my dear Meme, I'm very fond of you.' Swann felt relieved. For him, to whom it had occasionally happened, when chatting casually with people to whom he was barely listening, that he sometimes heard certain remarks (as, for example: 'I saw Mme de Crecy yesterday; she was with a gentleman I don't know'), remarks which, as soon as they entered Swann's heart, solidified, hardened like an encrustation, cut into him, never moved from there again, how sweet by contrast were these words: 'She knew no one, she spoke to no one,' how they circulated comfortably in him, how fluid they were, easy, breathable! And yet after a moment he would say to himself that Odette must find him quite tiresome if these were the pleasures she preferred to his company. And their insignificance, though it reassured him, nevertheless pained him like a betrayal. Even when he could not find out where she had gone, it would have been enough to soothe the anguish which he felt at these times, and for which Odette's presence, the sweetness of being close to her was the only specific (a specific that in the long run aggravated the disease, like many remedies, but at least momentarily soothed his pain), it would have been enough for him, if only Odette had permitted it, to remain in her house while she was out, to wait for her there until the hour of her return, into whose stillness and appeasement would have flowed and melted the hours which some magical illusion, some evil spell had made him believe were different from the rest. But she did not want this; he returned home; he forced himself, on the way, to make various plans, he stopped thinking about Odette; he even succeeded, while he was undressing, in turning over some fairly cheerful thoughts in his mind; and it was with a light heart, full of the hope of going to see some great painting the next day, that he got into bed and put out his light; but, no sooner, as he prepared to go to sleep, did he cease to exert upon himself a constraint of which he was not even aware because it was by now so habitual, than at that very instant an icy shiver would run through him and he would begin to sob. He did not even want to know why, dried his eyes, said to himself with a smile: 'Delightful I'm turning into a real neurotic.' Then he could not think without a feeling of great weariness that the next day he would again have to begin trying to find out what Odette had been doing, use all his influence to attempt to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without results was so cruel to him that one day, seeing a lump on his abdomen, he felt real joy at the thought that he might have a fatal tumor,",2.7822426553222788,1.286425713406152,0.43175799113875923,0.07970478249254387,4.273029966703662,4.0,2.2367713542563674,34.0,18.0,38.763433459704075,1.244173140954495,1.0,0.5971462926054949,1802,626,0.34739178690344064,7993,53,56.09220233156219,2.2936859293108325e+24,1.1166922732769389e+21,0.7138911007115474,0.689645424193027,67.06795227524975,12.351243063263041,10.777468490471529,15.708768035516094,15.695971143174248,8.454827968923414,49.76026637069922,5.3584905660377355,True,1161.0,0.8865628042843233,3.89143135345667,2054.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015827631982027978,0.015827631982027978,0.005718370264474625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01143674052894925,0.006126825283365669,0.003982436434187685,0.0024342745861733205,73,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"that he was no longer going to have to take charge of anything, that it was the disease that would manage him, make him its plaything, until the impending end. And indeed if, during this period, he often desired death though without admitting it to himself, it was to escape not so much the acuteness of his sufferings as the monotony of his struggle. And yet he would have liked to live on until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason to lie to him and he could at last learn from her if, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she was or was not in bed with Forcheville. Often for several days, the suspicion that she loved someone else would distract him from that question about Forcheville, would make it a matter almost of indifference to him, like those new developments in a continuing state of ill health which seem momentarily to have delivered us from the preceding ones. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He thought he was cured. But the next morning, when he woke up, he felt in the same place the same pain, the sensation of which, in the course of the preceding day, he had diluted in a flood of different impressions. But it had not moved from its place. And in fact, it was the sharpness of this pain that had woken Swann. Since Odette did not give him any information about these very important things which occupied her so fully each day (although he had lived long enough to know that these things are never anything else but pleasures), he could not try to imagine them for very long at a time, his brain was working with nothing in it; then he would pass his finger over his tired eyelids as he would have wiped the glass of his lorgnon, and stop thinking altogether. Yet floating up from that great unknown were certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by her to some obligation towards distant relatives or friends from an earlier time, who, because they were the only ones she regularly mentioned to him as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to form the stable, necessary framework of Odette's life. Because of the tone in which she referred from time to time to 'the day I go to the Hippodrome with my friend', if, having felt ill and thought: 'Perhaps Odette would be kind enough to come round to the house,' he recalled abruptly that this was in fact that very day, he would say to himself: 'Oh no! It's not worth the trouble of asking her to come, I should have thought of it earlier, this is the day she goes to the Hippodrome with her friend. We must confine ourselves to what's possible; it's pointless wearing oneself out proposing things that are unacceptable and have already been refused in advance.' And the duty incumbent upon Odette of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus yielded, did not appear to him merely unavoidable; but the mark of necessity with which it was stamped seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was closely or distantly related to it. If, after a man passing in the street had greeted Odette and aroused Swann's jealousy, she answered his questions by associating the stranger with one of the two or three paramount duties of which she had spoken to him, if, for example, she said: 'That was a gentleman who was in the box of the friend with whom I go to the Hippodrome,' this explanation would calm Swann's suspicions, since he did indeed find it inevitable that the friend would have other guests besides Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but had never tried or managed to picture them. Ah! how he would have liked to know her, the friend who went to the Hippodrome, and how he would have liked her to take him there with Odette! How gladly he would have given up all his connections in exchange for any person Odette was in the habit of seeing, even a manicurist or a shop assistant! He would have gone to more trouble for that person than for a queen. Wouldn't she have given him, with what she contained of Odette's life, the only effective calmative for his pain? How happily he would have hurried to spend the days at the home of one of those humble people with whom Odette kept up friendly relations out of either self-interest or true simplicity! How willingly he would have taken up residence for ever on the fifth floor of a certain sordid and coveted house to which Odette did not take him and in which, if he had lived there with the little retired dressmaker whose lover he would willingly have pretended to be, he would have had a visit from her almost every day! In these almost working-class neighbourhoods, what a modest life, abject, but sweet, nourished with calm and happiness, he would have agreed to live indefinitely! It also sometimes happened that when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching her whom he did not know, he could observe on Odette's face the sadness she had shown the day he had come to see her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for on the days when, despite everything she had to do and her fear of what other people would think, she managed to see Swann, what now predominated in her attitude was assurance: a great contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge or a natural reaction to the timorous emotion which, in the early days when she had known him, she had felt with him, and even far away from him, when she would begin a letter with these words: 'My dear, my hand is shaking so hard I can scarcely write' (at least so she claimed, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere for her to want to feign more of it). She liked Swann then. We do not tremble except for ourselves, except for those we love. When our happiness is no longer in their hands, what calm, what ease, what boldness we enjoy in their company! When speaking to him, when writing to him, she no longer used any of those words with which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating occasions for saying 'my', 'mine', when she referred to him 'You are my property, this is the fragrance of our friendship, I'm keeping it' and for talking to him about the future, about death even, as a single thing that would be shared by the two of them. In those days, to everything he said, she would answer admiringly: 'You you will never be like anyone else'; she would look at his long face, his slightly bald head, about which the people who knew of Swann's successes with women would think: 'He's not conventionally handsome, granted, but he is smart: that quiff of hair, that monocle, that smile!', and, perhaps with more curiosity to know what he was than desire to become his mistress, she would say: 'If only I could know what is in that head!' Now, to all of Swann's remarks she would reply in a tone that was at times irritated, at times indulgent: 'Oh, you really never will be like anyone else!' She would look at that head, which was only a little more aged by worry (but about which now everyone thought, with that same aptitude which enables you to discover the intentions of a symphonic piece when you have read the programme, and the resemblances of a child when you know its parents: 'He's not positively ugly, granted, but he is absurd; that monocle, that quiff of hair, that smile!' creating in their suggestible imaginations the immaterial demarcation that separates by several months' distance the head of an adored lover from the head of a cuckold), she would say: 'Oh, if only I could change what's in that head, if only I could make it reasonable.' Always prepared to believe what he hoped for, if Odette's behaviour towards him left any room at all for doubt, he would throw himself avidly on that remark: You can if you want to, he would say to her. And he would try to show her that to soothe him, direct him, make him work, would be a noble task to which many other women might ask nothing better than to devote themselves, though it would only be fair to add that in their hands the noble task would have appeared to him merely an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom. 'If she did not love me a little, he would say to himself, she would not want to transform me. In order to transform me, she will have to see more of me.' Thus he regarded this reproach of hers as a sort of proof of interest, of love perhaps; and indeed, she now gave him so few that he was obliged to regard as such the prohibitions she imposed on him against one thing or another. One day, she declared that she did not like his coachman, that he was perhaps turning Swann against her, that in any case he did not show the punctuality and the deference to Swann that she wanted. She felt that he longed to hear her say: 'Don't use him any more when you come to see me,' as he would have longed for a kiss. Since she was in a good mood, she said it; he was touched. That evening, chatting with M. de Charlus, with whom he had the comfort of being able to talk about her openly (for the least bit of conversation he had, even with people who did not know her, always somehow related to her), he said to him: Yet I believe she loves me; she is so kind to me, what I do is certainly not a matter of indifference to her. And if, when he was setting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop along the way, the friend said: 'Why, that's not Loredan on the box!', with what melancholy joy Swann would answer him: Oh Lord no! I tell you I can't use Loredan when I go to the rue La Perouse. Odette doesn't like me to use Loredan, she doesn't think he's good for me. Well, what do you expect! Women, you know, women!

"Remi, there'd be no end of trouble! This new manner, indifferent, distracted, irritable, which was now Odette's manner with him, certainly caused Swann to suffer; but he was not aware of his suffering; since it was only gradually, day by day, that Odette had cooled towards him, it was only by comparing what she was now to what she had been in the beginning that he would have been able to fathom the depth of the change that had taken place. Yet that change was his profound, his secret wound which hurt him day and night, and as soon as he felt that his thoughts were going a little too close to it, he would quickly guide them in another direction for fear of suffering too much. He would certainly say to himself in an abstract way: 'There was a time when Odette loved me more,' but he would never look back at that time. Just as there was a bureau in his office which he took pains not to look at, which he made a detour to avoid as he came and went, because in one of its drawers were stowed the chrysanthemum she had given him that first evening on which he had driven her home, and the letters in which she had said: 'If you had forgotten your heart here too, I would not have let you take it back,' and 'At whatever hour of the day or night you need me, send word and my life will be yours to command,' in the same way there was a place in him which he never let his thoughts approach, when necessary forcing them to make the detour of a lengthy argument so that they would not have to pass in front of it: this was the place in which lived the memory of the happy days. But his meticulous prudence was foiled one evening when he had gone out to a fashionable party. It was at the home of the Marquise de Saint-Euverte, on the last, for that year, of the evenings on which she invited people to hear the musicians who were afterwards used by her for her charity concerts. Swann, who had wanted to go to each of the preceding evenings in turn and had not been able to resolve to do it, had received, while he was dressing to go to this one, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who was coming with an offer to return with him to the home of the Marquise, if his company would help him to be a little less bored there, a little less sad. But Swann had answered: You can't doubt how much pleasure I would take in being with you. But the greatest pleasure you could give me would be to go to see Odette instead. You know what an excellent influence you have on her. I believe she's not going out this evening before she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she'd be delighted to have you accompany her there. In any case you'll find her at home before that. Try to amuse her and also to talk some sense to her. If you could arrange something for tomorrow that she enjoys and that we could all three do together... Also, try to begin planning for this summer, see if there's something she might want to do, a cruise we could all three take, I don't know. I'm not counting on seeing her tonight myself; still, if she wanted to see me or if you were to find a way, you would only need to send me word at Mme de Saint-Euverte's up to midnight, and afterwards at home. Thank you for all that you do for me you know how fond I am of you. The Baron promised to go and pay the visit that Swann wanted after he had driven him to the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where Swann arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the rue La Perouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not concern Odette, and in particular to the accoutrements of fashionable life, which gave them the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us as itself alone. As soon as he descended from the carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic life which hostesses like to offer their guests on ceremonial occasions and in which they seek to respect accuracy in costume and setting, Swann enjoyed the sight of the descendants of Balzac's 'tigers',86 the grooms, who normally followed along on the daily outing, now hatted and booted and posted outside in front of the house on the soil of the avenue, or in front of the stables, like gardeners lined up at the entrances to their flower-beds. The particular tendency he had always had to look for analogies between living people and portraits in museums was still active but in a more constant and general way; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him as a series of pictures. In the hall which in the old days, when he went out regularly into society, he would walk into wrapped in his overcoat and leave in his tails, but without knowing what had happened there, his mind having been, during the few moments he had stayed there, either still at the party he had just left, or already at the party he was about to be shown into, for the first time he noticed, woken by the unexpected arrival of the late guest, the scattered pack of tall, magnificent, idle footmen sleeping here and there on benches and chests who, raising their noble, sharp, greyhound profiles, stood up and gathered in a circle around him. One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect and rather like the executioner in certain Renaissance paintings depicting torture scenes, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his things. But the hardness of his steely look was compensated for by the softness of his cotton gloves, so that as he approached Swann he seemed to be showing contempt for his person and consideration for his hat. He took it with a care to which the exactness of his balance gave something meticulous, and with a delicacy which was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his strength. Then he passed it to one of his assistants, new and timid, who expressed the terror he felt by casting wild glances in all directions and displayed the agitation of a captive animal in the first hours of its domestication. A few steps away, a sturdy fellow in livery mused motionless, statuesque, useless, like the purely decorative warrior one sees in the most tumultuous paintings by Mantegna,87 lost in thought, leaning on his shield, while others beside him rush forward and slaughter one another; detached from his group of companions as they pressed around Swann, he seemed as resolved to take no part in this scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel sea-green eyes, as if it were the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint John. He seemed in fact to belong to that race which has vanished or which perhaps never existed except in the altarpiece of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Erimitani, where Swann had come in contact with it and where it dreams on still and which issued from the impregnation of an ancient statue by one of the Master's Paduan models or some Albrecht Durer Saxon.88 And the locks of his red hair, crimped by nature but glued by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in the Greek sculpture which the painter from Mantua studied so constantly and which, if out of all creation it depicts only man, is at least able to derive from his simple forms richnesses so varied, as though borrowed from all of living nature, that a head of hair, in the smooth rolls and sharp beaks of its curls, or in the superimposition of the threefold flowering diadem of its tresses, looks at once like a bundle of seaweed, a nestful of doves, a band of hyacinths and a coil of snakes. Still others, also colossal, stood on the steps of a monumental staircase to which their decorative presence and marmoreal immobility might have induced one to give the same name as the one in the Ducal Palace 'Staircase of the Giants' and which Swann began to climb with the sad thought that Odette had never ascended it. Oh, with what joy by contrast would he have gone up the dark, evil-smelling and rickety flights to the little retired dressmaker's, in whose 'fifth floor' he would have been so happy to pay more than the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening when Odette came there, and even on the other days, so as to be able to talk about her, live among the people she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there and who because of that seemed to him to harbour something, of his mistress's life, that was more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious. Whereas in the old dressmaker's pestilential and longed-for staircase, since there was no second, service stair, one saw in the evening in front of each door an empty, dirty milk-can set out in readiness on the mat, on the magnificent and disdained staircase which Swann was mounting at that moment, on either side, at different levels, in front of each anfractuosity formed in the wall by the window of the lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the domestic service which they directed and paying homage to the guests on their behalf, a concierge, a majordomo, a steward (good people who lived the rest of the week somewhat independent in their domains, dined there at home like small shopkeepers and by tomorrow would perhaps be in the bourgeois service of a doctor or manufacturer), heedful not to fail to carry out the instructions they had been given before being allowed to put on the dazzling livery which they wore only at rare intervals and in which they did not feel very much at ease, stood under the arcature of their portals with a stately glitter tempered by common good nature, like saints in their niches; and an enormous usher, dressed as though he were in church, struck the flagstones with his staff as each new arrival passed. Having reached the top of the staircase up the length of which he had",3.6940139674786416,1.0345013780063246,0.4365849279335019,0.04863096128237578,4.281923714759536,4.0,2.309666626514399,56.53125,38.0,52.017415578222455,1.263681592039801,1.0,0.6225999270862934,1809,680,0.37589828634604755,7981,32,61.805144614121254,6.9443765063735e+26,3.448051889957051e+23,0.8561155911414854,0.840037128329277,42.54831856343287,21.36863028606965,12.868033960526684,24.668884742951906,27.003485696517416,8.854107241569928,73.39139372581536,9.53125,True,1150.0,0.9066534260178749,3.9627606752730884,2014.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0049074736734485225,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012882118392802372,0.005623146917493099,0.0,0.005958291956305859,75,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"been followed by a wan-faced servant with a little bunch of hair tied in a cadogan89 at the back of his head, like a Goya90 sexton or a scrivener in an old play, Swann passed in front of a desk where valets, seated like notaries in front of great registers, stood up and inscribed his name. He then crossed a little vestibule which like certain rooms arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art, from which they take their name and, deliberately bare, contain nothing else displayed at its entrance, like some precious effigy by Benvenuto Cellini91 representing a watchman, a young footman, his body bent slightly forward, lifting from his red gorget a face even redder from which burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, and who, piercing with his impetuous, vigilant, distracted gaze the Aubusson tapestries hung before the drawing-room where people were listening to music, appeared, with a military impassiveness or a supernatural faith an allegory of alarm, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of the call to arms to be watching, angel or sentinel, from the tower of a castle or cathedral, for the appearance of the enemy or the hour of Judgment. Now Swann had only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which an usher loaded with chains was opening for him with a bow, as he would have handed over to him the keys to a city. But he thought of the house in which he might have been at that very moment, if Odette had permitted it, and the memory he glimpsed of an empty milk-can on a doormat wrung his heart. Swann rapidly recovered his sense of how ugly men could be, when, beyond the tapestry hangings, the spectacle of the servants was followed by that of the guests. But even the ugliness of these faces, though he knew it so well, seemed new to him since their features instead of being signs useable in a practical way for the identification of a certain person who had until then represented a cluster of pleasures to pursue, of worries to avoid, or of courtesies to pay now rested, coordinated only by aesthetic relations, in the autonomy of their lines. And in these men in the midst of whom Swann found himself hemmed in, even the monocles that many wore (and which, formerly, would at the very most have allowed Swann to say that they wore a monocle), having now been released from signifying a habit, the same for everyone, each appeared to him with a sort of individuality. Maybe because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Breaute, who were talking to each other just inside the door, as more than two figures in a painting, whereas for a long time they had been useful friends who had introduced him to the Jockey Club and supported him in duels, the general's monocle, stuck between his eyelids like a shell-splinter in his vulgar, scarred, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it blinded like the Cyclops' single eye, appeared to Swann like a monstrous wound that might have been glorious to receive, but that was indecent to show off; whereas the one that M. de Breaute added, as a badge of festivity, to the pearl grey gloves, the opera hat, and the white tie, and substituted for the familiar lorgnette (as Swann himself did) for going out in society, bore, glued to its other side, like a natural history specimen under a microscope, an infinitesimal gaze teeming with friendliness that smiled constantly at the loftiness of the ceilings, the beauty of the preparations, the interest of the programmes and the quality of the refreshments. Well now, here you are! Why, it's been an eternity since we last saw you, said the General to Swann and, noticing his drawn features and concluding from this that it was perhaps a grave illness that had kept him away from society, he added: 'You look quite well, you know!' while M. de Breaute asked: 'My dear, what in the world are you doing here?' of a society novelist who had just settled into the corner of his eye a monocle which was his only organ of psychological investigation and pitiless analysis and answered with an air of mystery and self-importance, rolling the r: I am observing! The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minuscule, had no border and, requiring a constant painful clenching of the eye, where it was incrusted like a superfluous cartlilage whose presence was inexplicable and whose material was exquisite, gave the Marquis's face a melancholy delicacy, and made women think he was capable of suffering greatly in love. But that of M. de Saint-Cande, surrounded by a gigantic ring, like Saturn, was the centre of gravity of a face which regulated itself at each moment in relation to it, a face whose quivering red nose and thick-lipped sarcastic mouth attempted by their grimaces to equal the unceasing salvoes of wit sparkling from the disk of glass, and saw itself preferred to the handsomest eyes in the world by snobbish and depraved young women in whom it inspired dreams of artifical charms and a refinement of voluptuousness; and meanwhile, behind his own, M. de Palancy, who, with his big, round-eyed carp's head, moved about slowly in the midst of the festivities unclenching his mandibles from moment to moment as though seeking to orient himself, merely seemed to be transporting with him an accidental and perhaps purely symbolic fragment of the glass of his aquarium, a part intended to represent the whole, reminding Swann, a great admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, of Injustice, next to whom a leafy bough evokes the forests in which his lair is hidden. Swann had walked on into the room, at the insistence of Mme de Saint-Euverte, and in order to hear a melody from Orphee92 that was being performed by a flautist, had placed himself in a corner where unfortunately his only view was of two mature ladies seated next to each other, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, spent all their time at parties, clutching their bags and followed by their daughters, looking for each other as though in a railway-station and did not rest easy until they had reserved, with a fan or a handkerchief, two seats side by side: Mme de Cambremer, since she had very few acquaintances, being all the happier to have a companion, Mme de Franquetot, who was in contrast extremely well connected, believing there was something elegant, something original, about showing all her fine friends that she preferred, to their company, an obscure lady with whom she shared memories of her youth. Full of a melancholy irony, Swann watched them as they listened to the piano intermezzo ('Saint Francis Preaching to the Birds' by Liszt)93 which had come after the flute melody, and as they followed the vertiginous playing of the virtuoso, Mme de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes wild as if the keys over which he ran with such agility were a series of trapezes from which he might fall from a height of eighty metres, and at the same time casting at her neighbour looks of astonishment, of denial which signified: 'This is not to be believed, I would never have thought a man could do this,' Mme de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a strong musical education, marking time with her head transformed into the arm of a metronome of which the amplitude and rapidity of oscillations from one shoulder to the other had become such (with that sort of frenzy and abandon in the eyes characteristic of a kind of suffering which is no longer aware of itself nor tries to control itself and says 'I can't help it!') that she kept snagging her solitaires in the straps of her bodice and was obliged to straighten the black grapes she had in her hair, though without ceasing to accelerate her motion. On the other side of Mme de Franquetot, but a little in front, was the Marquise de Gallardon, occupied with her favourite thought, the alliance which she had with the Guermantes and which in the eyes of the world and in her own was the source of a good deal of glory along with some shame, the most brilliant of them keeping her a bit at a distance, perhaps because she was tiresome, or because she was spiteful, or because she was from an inferior branch, or perhaps for no reason. When she found herself next to someone she did not know, as at this moment next to Mme de Franquetot, it would pain her that the awareness she had of her kinship with the Guermantes could not be manifested outwardly in visible characters like those which, in the mosaics of the Byzantine churches, placed one below another, inscribe in a vertical column, next to a holy personage, the words that he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation or a visit from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, in the six years the Princesse had been married. This thought filled her with anger, but also with pride; for, by dint of saying to people who were surprised not to see her at the home of Mme des Laumes, that it was because she would have risked meeting Princesse Mathilde94 there for which her ultra-Legitimist family would never have forgiven her she had ended by believing this actually was the reason she did not go to her young cousin's house. Yet she recalled having asked Mme des Laumes several times how she could contrive to meet her, but recalled it only confusedly and also more than neutralized this slightly humiliating memory by murmuring: 'After all it's not up to me to make the first move, I'm twenty years older than she.' Empowered by the virtue of these interior words, she proudly threw back her shoulders, which seemed detached from her bust and on which her head was positioned almost horizontally so that one was reminded of the 'restored' head of a proud pheasant that is brought to a table with all its feathers. It was not so much that she was not stocky, mannish and plump by nature; but the insults she had received had straightened her up like those trees which, born in a bad position at the brink of a precipice, are forced to grow backwards to keep their balance. Obliged, in order to console herself for not being altogether the equal of the other Guermantes, to keep telling herself that it was because of the intransigence of her",4.495306940159678,1.77360553636075,0.4378204365021661,0.05068381738854755,4.523441809156095,4.0,2.5155066493181555,72.52,52.0,58.25538258392953,1.3375620518477662,1.0,0.6932867053008595,1813,748,0.4125758411472697,8443,25,62.08010796053656,9.142149589775232e+26,4.4726759245475695e+23,0.829152979888022,0.8131336592461752,20.06945041367902,28.476032211803645,16.50229616247365,32.03061445118588,36.13541092112521,10.389674572531717,94.41740761169332,15.88,True,1072.0,0.8918786692759295,4.130626223091976,2044.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003905105925998243,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010543786000195255,0.003124084740798594,0.005271893000097627,0.015166340508806261,76,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"principles and her pride that she did not see them very often, this thought had ended by shaping her body and by giving her an imposing sort of presence that passed in the eyes of bourgeois women for a sign of breeding and sometimes disturbed with a fleeting desire the weary glances of the clubmen. If Mme de Gallardon's conversation had been subjected to those analyses which, by recording the greater or lesser frequency of each word, permit one to discover the key to a language in code, one would have realized that no expression, even the most ordinary, recurred in it as often as 'at the home of my cousins the Guermantes', 'at the home of my Aunt de Guermantes', 'the health of Elzear de Guermantes', 'my cousin de Guermantes's baignoire'.95 When anyone spoke to her about a famous personage, she would answer that without knowing him personally she had met him a thousand times at the home of her Aunt de Guermantes, but she would answer this in a tone so icy and in a voice so low that it was clear that, if she did not know him personally, it was by virtue of all the ineradicable and stubborn principles which her shoulders touched behind her, like those ladders on which gymnastics instructors make you stretch out in order to develop your chest. Now as it happened, the Princesse des Laumes, whom one would not have expected to see at Mme de Saint-Euverte's, had just arrived. In order to show that she was not trying to advertise, in a drawing-room to which she had come only out of condescension, the superiority of her rank, she had entered with her shoulders turned sideways even where there was no crowd to cleave through and no person attempting to get past her, staying deliberately at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in line at the door of a theatre so long as the management have not been informed that he is there; and, merely confining her gaze so as not to seem to be signalling her presence and demanding attention to a consideration of the design in the carpet or in her own skirt, she stood in the spot that had seemed to her the most modest (and from which she was well aware she would be drawn by a delighted exclamation from Mme de Saint-Euverte as soon as the latter noticed her), next to Mme de Cambremer, whom she did not know. She observed the pantomime of her music-loving neighbour, but did not imitate it. It was not that, the one time she came to spend five minutes at Mme de Saint-Euverte's, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished, so that the courtesy she was showing her might count double, to prove as friendly as possible. But by nature, she had a horror of what she called 'exaggerations' and was anxious to show that she 'did not have to' indulge in displays of emotion which were not in keeping with the 'style' of the circle she moved in, but which still, on the other hand, could not help but impress her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation akin to timidity which is developed in the most confident persons by the atmosphere of a new environment, even if it is an inferior one. She began to wonder if this gesticulation was not perhaps a necessary response to the piece being played, which did not come quite within the scope of the music she had heard up to now, if to refrain was not to give proof of incomprehension with respect to the work and impropriety towards the lady of the house: so that, in order to express both of her contradictory inclinations by a compromise, she first merely straightened up her shoulder-straps or put a hand to her blonde hair to secure the little balls of coral or pink enamel flecked with diamonds which formed her simple and charming coiffure, while at the same time examining her ardent neighbour with cold curiosity, then with her fan she beat time for a moment, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, on the off-beat. When the pianist ended the piece by Liszt and begun a prelude by Chopin, Mme de Cambremer gave Mme de Franquetot a fond smile of competent satisfaction and allusion to the past. When she was young she had learned to caress the phrases of Chopin with their sinuous and excessively long necks, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking out and exploring a place for themselves far outside and away from the direction in which they started, far beyond the point which one might have expected them to reach, and which frolic in this fantasy distance only to come back more deliberately with a more premeditated return, with more precision, as though upon a crystal glass that resonates until you cry out to strike you in the heart. Living in a provincial family that had few friends, scarcely ever going out to a ball, she had intoxicated herself in the solitude of her manor house, with all those imaginary dancing couples, now slowing them, now speeding them, now scattering them like flowers, now leaving the ball for a moment to hear the wind blow in the pine trees, at the edge of the lake, and suddenly seeing, as he came towards her there, more unlike anything anyone had ever dreamed of than an earthly lover could be, a slender young man in white gloves whose voice had a strange and false lilt to it. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of that music seemed stale. Having fallen in the esteem of the discriminating public over the past several years, it had lost its position of distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste is bad no longer took more than an unacknowledged and moderate pleasure in it. Mme de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new family, except regarding the things of the mind about which, since she knew a little harmony and even some Greek, she was especially enlightened) despised Chopin and suffered when she heard it played. But far away from the surveillance of that Wagnerian who was off in the distance with a group of people her own age, Mme de Cambremer abandoned herself to her delightful impressions. The Princesse des Laumes was enjoying them too. Though without a natural gift for music, she had had lessons fifteen years earlier from a piano teacher of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who at the end of her life had been reduced to poverty and had returned, at the age of seventy, to giving piano lessons, to the daughters and grand-daughters of her old pupils. She was dead now. But her method, her lovely sound, came back to life sometimes under the fingers of her pupils, even those who had become in other respects ordinary people, had abandoned music and almost never opened a piano any more. And so Mme des Laumes could shake her head, with expert knowledge, with a just appreciation of the way the pianist was playing this prelude, which she knew by heart. The end of the phrase he had begun already sang on her lips. And she murmured, 'It's always charming,' with a double ch at the start of the word which was a mark of refinement and which, she felt, crinkled her lips so romantically like a beautiful flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony with them by giving them an expression just then of sentimentality and vague yearning. Meanwhile, Mme de Gallardon was saying to herself how annoying it was that she only very rarely had the opportunity to meet the Princesse des Laumes, for she wanted to teach her a lesson by not responding to her greeting. She did not know her cousin was there. A movement of Mme de Franquetot's head revealed the Princesse to her. Immediately she hurried towards her, disturbing everyone; but though she wanted to preserve a haughty and glacial manner which would remind everyone that she did not wish to be on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself coming face to face with Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not for her to make advances since she was not 'of her generation', still she wanted to offset this air of haughtiness and reserve by some remark that would justify her overture and force the Princesse to engage in conversation; and so when she came near her cousin, Mme de Gallardon, with a hard expression and a hand out-thrust like a 'forced' card, said to her: 'How is your husband?' in the concerned tone she would have used if the Prince had been gravely ill. The Princesse, bursting into a laugh which was peculiar to her and which was intended at once to show others that she was making fun of someone and also to make herself look prettier by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: Why, he's never been better! And she laughed again. Whereupon Mme de Gallardon, drawing herself up and contriving an expression which was even chillier, yet still concerned about the Prince's condition, said to her cousin: Oriane (here Mme des Laumes looked with an air of surprise and merriment at an invisible third party in whose presence she seemed to be anxious to attest that she had never authorized Mme de Gallardon to call her by her first name), I would be so pleased if you could stop by my house for a moment tomorrow evening to hear a clarinet quintet by Mozart. I would like to have your opinion. She seemed not to be offering an invitation, but to be asking a favour, and to need the Princesse's assessment of the Mozart quintet as if it were a dish composed by a new cook about whose talents it was valuable to her to obtain the opinion of a gourmet. But I know that quintet. I can tell you right now... I like it! You know, my husband isn't well; it's his liver... It would give him great pleasure to see you, resumed Mme de Gallardon, now placing the Princesse under a charitable obligation to appear at her soiree. The Princesse never liked to tell people she did not want to go to their homes. Every day she would write notes expressing her regrets at having been prevented by an unexpected visit from her mother-in-law, an invitation from her brother-in-law, the opera, an expedition to the country from attending a soiree to which she would never have",3.355105249858527,1.4868546802078146,0.4281931455251177,0.04960460696746737,4.3962575674188225,4.0,2.440564203860186,44.31707317073171,32.0,44.40030708770437,1.3247110621904237,1.0,0.6784765840676013,1817,674,0.3709411117226197,8233,41,58.34484508796029,2.181947361408554e+25,1.072737149168414e+22,0.7796445295214653,0.7836851087900308,49.782614870397495,17.325249070432367,13.18347010919545,20.522646549525486,21.43490972790851,9.382080352228947,63.249379169631,8.390243902439025,True,1099.0,0.8992133726647001,4.0476892822025565,2034.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02342270507325825,0.008771055516794577,0.005182896441742251,0.005182896441742251,0.0,0.0,0.008970397687630818,0.00956842420013954,0.004186185587561049,0.011307767944936086,77,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the joy of believing that she was one of their friends, that she would readily have gone to visit them, that she had been kept from doing so only by princely inconveniences which they were flattered to see enter into competition with their soiree. Then, too, since she was part of that witty circle of the Guermantes in which something survived of the alert mentality unburdened by platitudes and conventional feelings which was handed down from Merimee96 and had found its latest expression in the theatre of Meilhac and Halevy,97 she adapted it even to social relations, transposed it even into her politeness, which endeavoured to be positive and precise, and to approximate the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her desire to be present at her party; she thought it friendlier to put to her a few little facts on which it would depend whether or not it was possible for her to come. The thing is, she said to Mme de Gallardon, tomorrow evening I have to go to see a friend who has been asking me to make a date with her for ages. If she takes us to the theatre, even with the best will in the world there won't be any chance of my coming to you; but if we stay in the house, since I know we'll be alone, I'll be able to leave her. Oh, by the way, did you see your friend M. Swann? Why no! My beloved Charles, I didn't know he was here, I must try to attract his attention. It's funny that he should go to old Saint-Euverte's, said Mme de Gallardon. Oh, I know he's intelligent, she added, meaning he was a schemer, but still and all, a Jew in the home of the sister and sister-in-law of two archbishops! I confess to my shame that I'm not shocked, said the Princesse des Laumes. I know he's a convert, and even his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say converts remain more attached to their religion than anyone else, that it's all just a pretence. Is that true? I don't know a thing about that. The pianist, who was to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the prelude had immediately attacked a polonaise. But now that Mme de Gallardon had told her cousin that Swann was there, Chopin himself might have risen from the dead and played all his pieces in succession without Mme des Laumes paying the slightest attention. She belonged to that half of the human race in whom the curiosity the other half feels about the people it does not know is replaced by an interest in the people it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence in a place where she happened to be of someone from her set, though she had nothing in particular to say to him, monopolized her attention at the expense of everything else. From that moment on, in the hopes that Swann would notice her, the Princesse, like a tame white mouse to which one offers a bit of sugar and then withdraws it, kept turning her face, which was filled with a thousand signs of complicity unrelated to the feeling in Chopin's polonaise, in Swann's direction and if he moved, she would shift in a corresponding direction her magnetic smile. Oriane, don't be angry, resumed Mme de Gallardon, who could never stop herself from sacrificing her greatest social ambitions and highest hopes of some day dazzling the world to the immediate, obscure and private pleasure of saying something disagreeable, but people do claim that M. Swann is someone whom one can't have in one's house; is that true? Why... you ought to know it's true, answered the Princesse des Laumes, since you've invited him fifty times and he hasn't come once. And leaving her mortified cousin, she burst into laughter again, scandalizing the people who were listening to the music, but attracting the attention of Mme de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed near the piano out of politeness and only now noticed the Princesse. Mme de Saint-Euverte was especially delighted to see Mme des Laumes because she had thought she was still at Guermantes looking after her sick father-in-law. Why, Princesse, I didn't know you were here! Yes, I tucked myself away in a little corner, and I've been hearing such lovely things. What! Have you been here for a long time? Why yes, a very long time which seemed very short to me it was long only because I couldn't see you. Mme de Saint-Euverte tried to give her chair to the Princesse, who answered: Oh, please, no! Why should you? I'm comfortable wherever I sit!' And, intentionally selecting, the better to display her simplicity, great lady though she was, a low seat without a back: Here, this hassock is all I need. It'll make me sit up straight. Oh, my Lord, I'm making too much noise again, if I'm not careful they'll turn on me and throw me out. Meanwhile, the pianist having redoubled his speed, the musical emotion was at its height, a servant was passing refreshments on a tray and making the spoons clink and, as happened every week, Mme de Saint-Euverte signalled to him, without his seeing her, to go away. A newly-wed, who had been taught that a young woman must not appear bored, smiled with pleasure, and tried to catch the hostess's eye in order to send her a look her gratitude for having 'thought of her' for such a treat. However, although she remained calmer than Mme de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the music; but the object of her uneasiness was, not the pianist, but the piano, on which a candle jumping with each fortissimo risked, if not setting its shade on fire, at least spotting the Brazilian rosewood. In the end she could not bear it any longer and, scaling the two steps of the dais on which the piano was placed, swooped down to remove the sconce. But her hands were just about to touch it when, with a final chord, the piece ended and the pianist stood up. Nevertheless the young woman's bold initiative, the resulting brief promiscuity between her and the instrumentalist, produced a generally favourable impression. Did you see what that young woman did, Princesse? said General de Froberville to the Princesse des Laumes, whom he had come up to greet and whom Mme de Saint-Euverte had left for a moment. Odd, wasn't it? Is she a performer? No, she's just some young Mme de Cambremer, answered the Princesse without thinking and then added hurriedly: I'm only repeating what I heard, I haven't the slightest idea who she is; someone behind me was saying they were country neighbours of Mme de Saint-Euverte, but I don't think anyone knows them, really. They must be 'country folk'! Anyway, I don't know if you're intimate with the brilliant society here, but I can't put a name to any of these astonishing people. What do you think they spend their time doing when they're not at Mme de Saint-Euverte's evenings? She must have ordered them along with the musicians, the chairs and the refreshments. You must admit these 'guests from Belloir's'98 are magnificent. Does she really have the heart to rent the same 'extras' every week? It isn't possible! But Cambremer is quite a good name, and an old one too, said the General. I see no harm in the fact that it's old, answered the Princesse drily, but still, it's not euphonious, she added, isolating the word euphonious as though between quotation marks, a little affectation in delivery that was peculiar to the Guermantes set. You think so? She's pretty enough to eat, though, said the General, who had not let Mme de Cambremer out of his sight. Don't you agree, Princesse? She thrusts herself forward too much, I think; in so young a woman, that's not nice because I don't believe she's of my generation, answered Mme des Laumes (this expression being common to both the Gallardons and the Guermantes). But then the Princesse, seeing that M. de Froberville was continuing to gaze at Mme de Cambremer, added half out of spite against her, half out of friendliness towards the General: 'Not nice... for her husband! I'm sorry I don't know her, since you've set your heart on her; I would have introduced you,' she continued, although she probably would have done nothing of the kind if she had known the young woman. 'I will have to say goodnight to you, because it's the birthday of a friend of mine and I must go and pay my respects, she said in a tone of modest sincerity, reducing the fashionable party to which she was going to the simplicity of a ceremony which was tiresome but which it was obligatory and also rather touching to attend. Besides, I'm supposed to meet Basin there; while I've been here, he has been seeing friends of his people you know, I believe. They who have the same name as a bridge: the Ienas.' It was the name of a victory before it was a bridge, Princesse, said the General. What do you expect an old trooper like me, he went on, removing his monocle and wiping it, as he would have changed a bandage, while the Princesse instinctively looked away. That Empire nobility, it's different of course, but really, for what it is, it's very fine of its kind. They were people who, when all is said and done, fought like heroes. But I have the deepest respect for heroes, said the Princesse, in a slightly ironic tone: if I don't go with Basin to see this woman, the Princesse d'Iena, it's not because of that, not at all, it's quite simply because I don't know them. Basin knows them, he loves them dearly. Oh no, it's not what you may think, they're not having an affair, I have no reason to object! Anyway, what use is it when I do try to object? she added in a melancholy voice, because everyone knew that the very day after the Prince des Laumes married his ravishing cousin, he had deceived her, and he had not stopped deceiving her since. But this is not the same, these are people he used to know, he's happy as a pig in clover, I think it's very nice. But I can tell you that even what he has told me about their house... Can you imagine, all their furniture is 'Empire'! Well, naturally, Princesse; it was their grandparents' furniture. Well, I'm not saying it wasn't, but",2.8569998484054784,0.9992460791913912,0.4069586189132225,0.0754702610880298,4.277440706012134,4.0,2.36580802568229,22.949367088607595,19.0,16.793533063771307,1.277992277992278,1.0,0.6230947316561912,1813,608,0.3353557639271925,8226,79,70.3583912571247,3.5996566550026004e+30,1.6618913457999078e+27,0.6985288632985873,0.6824991561762699,75.42324568691659,8.440562044865846,10.081333035307086,11.761103702514191,10.19142926962095,8.061555432984001,40.32388446312497,3.9873417721518987,True,1175.0,0.8679593721144968,3.7977839335180055,2166.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026929982046678635,0.009176142030720128,0.0047875523638539795,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008976660682226212,0.010373030121683623,0.00907640135647317,0.015235457063711912,78,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"it's no less ugly for all that. I understand perfectly well that one can't always have pretty things, but at least one's things should not be ridiculous. What do you expect? I can't think of anything more conventional, more bourgeois, than that horrible style cabinets with swans' heads like bathtubs. Actually I do believe they have some beautiful things, they must have that famous mosaic table that was used for the signing of the Treaty of... Oh, I'm not saying they don't have things that are interesting from a historical point of view. But things like that can't ever be beautiful... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that myself which Basin inherited from the Montesquious. Only they're in the attics of Guermantes where no one can see them. Anyway, really, that's not the point, I would rush around to their house with Basin, I would see them even in the midst of their sphinxes and their brass if I knew them, but... I don't know them! I was always told when I was little that it wasn't polite to go to the homes of people one didn't know, she said, assuming a childish tone. So I'm just doing what I was taught. Can't you see those good people if someone they didn't know were to come bursting into the house? They might make me feel quite unwelcome! said the Princesse. And she coquettishly enhanced the smile which this supposition had brought to her lips by giving her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a dreamy, gentle expression. Ah, Princesse, you know very well they wouldn't be able to contain themselves for joy... Not at all. she asked him with the utmost vivacity, either so as not to seem to know that it was because she was one of the foremost ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General say it. What do you know about it? It might be the most disagreeable thing in the world for them. I don't know, but judging by myself, it already bores me so much to see the people I know, I believe that if I had to see people I didn't know, even if they had 'fought like heroes', I would go mad. Besides, you see, except when it's an old friend like you whom one knows quite apart from that, I don't know if heroism would take one very far in society. I often find it quite boring enough as it is to give a dinner-party, but if I had to offer my arm to Spartacus going in to the table... No, really, Vercingetorix would never be the one I would send for, to make a fourteenth. I think I would save him for the large parties. And since I don't give any... Ah, Princesse, you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it all right, the wit of the Guermantes family! They always say 'the wit of the Guermantes family'. I've never been able to understand why. Do you know other Guermantes who have it? she added in a bubbly, joyful burst of laughter, her features concentrated, interconnected in a network of animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety that could be kindled only by remarks, even if made by the Princesse herself, in praise of her wit or her beauty. Wait, there's Swann. He seems to be speaking to your young Cambremer. There... he's next to old mother Saint-Euverte, don't you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he's trying to walk away! How frightfully ill he's looking did you notice? said the General. My dear Charles! At last he's coming, I was beginning to think he didn't want to see me! Swann liked the Princesse des Laumes very much, and also the sight of her reminded him of Guermantes, the estate next to Combray, the whole countryside which he loved so much and had ceased to visit so as not to be away from Odette. Using the half-artistic, half-courtly formulae which he knew were pleasing to the Princesse and which he resumed quite naturally as soon as he reimmersed himself for a moment in his old social milieu and wanting anyway for his own sake to express the yearning he felt for the country: Ah, he said to some vague general audience, in order to be heard both by Mme de Saint-Euverte, to whom he was speaking, and by Mme des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, here's the charming Princesse! See, she has come up from Guermantes expressly to hear Liszt's Saint Francis of Assisi and has only just had time, like a pretty titmouse, to go and pluck a little fruit from the wild plums and hawthorns and put them on her head; there is even a bit of dew on them still, a bit of the hoarfrost that must be making the duchess groan so. It's very pretty indeed, my dear Princesse. What, the Princesse has come up expressly from Guermantes? But that's too much! I didn't know, I'm embarrassed, exclaimed Mme de Saint-Euverte naively, not being used to Swann's wit. Then, looking more closely at the Princesse's headgear: Why you're quite right, it's meant to look like... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no oh what a ravishing idea! But how could the Princesse have known what was going to be on my programme! The musicians didn't even tell me. Swann, who was accustomed, when he was in the company of a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in gallant language, to say things so delicately nuanced that many society people could not understand them, did not condescend to explain to Mme de Saint-Euverte that he had merely been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princesse, she began laughing heartily, because Swann's wit was highly appreciated in her set and also because she could not hear a compliment addressed to her without finding it most exquisitely subtle and irresistibly droll. Well! I'm delighted, Charles, if you like my little hawthorn fruits. Why did you speak to that Cambremer woman? Are you her neighbour in the country too? Mme de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princesse appeared happy to chat with Swann, had moved off. But you are too, Princesse. But then those people have country places everywhere! How I would like to be in their place! It's not the Cambremers, it's her own family; she's a Legrandin daughter and used to come to Combray. I don't know if you know you're the Comtesse de Combray and the chapter owes you a due? I don't know what the chapter owes me, but I know that I'm dunned a hundred francs every year by the cure, which I could do without. Really these Cambremers have a most astonishing name.100 It ends just in time, but it ends badly! she said, laughing. It doesn't begin any better, Swann answered. Really, the two abbreviations together! Someone very angry and very proper didn't dare finish the first word. But since he couldn't stop himself from beginning the second, he should have finished the first then he'd be done with it once and for all. Our jokes are in charming taste, my little Charles, but how tiresome it is not to see you any more, she added in a caressing tone, I so much like talking to you. Just think, I wouldn't even have been able to make that idiot Froberville understand that the name Cambremer is astonishing. Admit that life is a dreadful thing. It's only when I see you that I stop feeling bored. This was probably not true. But Swann and the Princesse had the same way of looking at the small things of life, the effect of which unless it was the cause was a great similarity in their ways of expressing themselves and even in their pronunciation. No one noticed the resemblance because their two voices were so utterly unlike. But if in one's imagination one managed to divest Swann's remarks of the sonority in which they were enveloped, of the moustache from under which they issued, one realized that these were the same sentences, the same inflections, that these turns of phrase belonged to the Guermantes set. When it came to the important things, Swann and the Princesse did not have the same ideas about anything. But now that Swann had become so sad, always in the sort of tremulous condition that precedes the moment one is going to cry, he felt as compelled to talk about grief as a murderer is to talk about his crime. When he heard the Princesse say that life was a dreadful thing, he felt as comforted as if she had been talking about Odette. Oh, yes! Life is a dreadful thing. We must see each other soon, my dear friend. What's so nice about being with you is that you're not cheerful. We could spend an evening together. What a good idea! Why don't you come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be so ugly thereabouts, but I must say I don't dislike that countryside at all; I have a horror of 'picturesque' spots. I agree, it's wonderful, answered Swann, it's almost too beautiful, too alive for me just now; it's a place to be happy in. Perhaps it's because I've lived there, but the things there speak to me so! As soon as a breath of wind comes up, when the wheat begins to move, it seems to me that someone is about to arrive, I'm going to hear some news; and those little houses by the edge of the water... I would be quite miserable! Oh, my dear Charles, watch out, there's that dreadful Rampillon woman. She's seen me; please hide me. Remind me what it was that happened to her; I'm getting it all mixed up; she's just married off her daughter, or her lover, I can't remember which; maybe both of them... and to each other! Oh no! I remember now, she's been dropped by her prince... Pretend to be talking to me, so that Berenice woman won't come over and invite me to dinner. Anyway, I must fly. Listen, my dear Charles, now that I've seen you for once, won't you let me steal you away and take you to the Princesse's? She'd be so pleased to see you, and Basin, too he's meeting me there. If we didn't get news of you from Meme... Just think, I never see you at all now! Swann declined; having told M. de Charlus that when he left Mme de Saint-Euverte's he would go directly back home, he did not want to run the risk, by going on",2.4843913839842817,0.813490349846881,0.3994740812072683,0.07213058725500873,4.161147902869757,4.0,2.2799327103130054,16.472727272727273,11.0,14.89277377602311,1.2345474613686533,1.0,0.5545901818662801,1812,577,0.3184326710816777,8043,110,69.9749196932993,2.4531352577373658e+30,1.1325647542647119e+27,0.6770339706793017,0.6732795847993758,85.67246658639377,5.4020236805137465,7.9396628663295825,8.310945213726672,6.405370258880197,6.870640176600443,31.649327714228377,2.5,True,1242.0,0.8758079409048938,3.7132963988919667,2166.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.040028446611805345,0.010769074469165904,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004266991770801585,0.004978157065935182,0.00609570252971655,0.0110803324099723,79,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to the Princess of Parma's, of missing a note that he had been hoping all evening would be handed to him by a servant during the party, and that perhaps he would find in his concierge's keeping. 'Poor Swann, said Mme des Laumes that night to her husband, he's always kind, but he appears quite unhappy. You'll see, because he has promised to come to dinner one of these days. I do find it absurd that a man of his intelligence should suffer over a person of that sort, who isn't even interesting because they say she's an idiot,' she added with the wisdom of people not in love who believe a man of sense should be unhappy only over a person who is worth it; which is rather like being surprised that anyone should condescend to suffer from cholera because of so small a creature as the comma bacillus. Swann wanted to leave, but just when he was at last about to escape, General de Froberville asked him for an introduction to Mme de Cambremer and he was obliged to go back into the drawing-room with him to look for her. Now, Swann, I'd rather be the husband of that woman than slaughtered by savages, what do you say? The words 'slaughtered by savages' pierced Swann's heart painfully; and at once he felt the need to continue the conversation: Well, you know, he said to him, some really fine lives that have ended that way... For instance, if you remember... That navigator whose ashes were brought back by Dumont d'Urville, La Perouse... (And Swann was immediately happy, as if he had spoken Odette's name.) He was a fine character, La Perouse was, and one who interests me very much, he added with a melancholy air. Oh, yes, of course. La Perouse, said the General. It's a well-known name. There's even a street by that name. You know someone in the rue La Perouse? asked Swann in some agitation. I know only Mme de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave us a nice theatre-party the other day. Her salon will be very elegant one of these days, you'll see! Ah, so she lives in the rue La Perouse. It's an appealing street, very pretty, and so melancholy. Why, not at all, that's because you haven't been there for some time; it's not melancholy now, they're beginning to build there, they're building in the whole neighbourhood. When at last Swann introduced M. de Froberville to young Mme de Cambremer, since it was the first time she had heard the General's name she ventured the smile of joy and surprise she would have given him if no other name but that one had ever been uttered in her presence, for as she did not know the friends of her new family, each time a person was presented to her, she believed he was one of them, and thinking it would be tactful of her to look as though she had heard such a lot about him since she was married, she would put out her hand with a hesitant air meant as a proof of the inculcated reserve she had to conquer and the spontaneous congeniality that succeeded in overcoming it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still believed to be the most brilliant people in France, declared that she was an angel; especially since they preferred to appear, in marrying their son to her, to have responded to the attraction of her fine qualities rather than of her great wealth. One can see that you have the soul of a musician, Madame, the General said to her, unconsciously alluding to the incident of the sconce. But the concert was beginning again and Swann realized he would not be able to leave before the end of this new number. He was suffering at having to remain shut up among these people whose stupidity and absurd habits struck him all the more painfully since being unaware of his love, incapable, had they known about it, of taking any interest in it or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish nonsense or deplore it as utter madness, they made it appear to him as a subjective state which existed only for him, whose reality was confirmed for him by nothing outside himself; he suffered most of all, to the point where even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry out, from prolonging his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, where no one, where nothing knew her, from which she was entirely absent. But suddenly it was as though she had appeared in the room, and this apparition caused him such harrowing pain that he had to put his hand on his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes on which it lingered as though waiting for something, holding on to them in a prolonged expectancy, in the exaltation of already seeing the object of its expectation approaching, and with a desperate effort to try to endure until it arrived, to welcome it before expiring, to keep the way open for it another moment with a last bit of strength so that it could come through, as one holds up a trap-door that would otherwise fall back. And before Swann had time to understand, and say to himself: 'It's the little phrase from the sonata by Vinteuil; don't listen!' all his memories of the time when Odette was in love with him, which he had managed until now to keep out of sight in the deepest part of himself, deceived by this sudden beam of light from the time of love which they believed had returned, had awoken and flown swiftly back up to sing madly to him, with no pity for his present misfortune, the forgotten refrains of happiness. In place of the abstract expressions 'the time when I was happy', 'the time when I was loved', which he had often used before now without suffering too much, for his mind had enclosed within them only spurious extracts of the past that preserved nothing of it, he now recovered everything which had fixed for ever the specific, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he saw everything again, the snowy curled petals of the chrysanthemum that she had tossed to him in his carriage, that he had held against his lips the embossed address of the 'Maison Doree' on the letter in which he had read: 'My hand is shaking so hard as I write to you' the way her eyebrows had come together when she said to him with a supplicating look: 'It won't be too long before you send word to me?'; he smelled the fragrance of the hairdresser's iron by which he would have his 'brush-cut' straightened while Loredan went to fetch the young working-girl, the stormy rains that fell so often that spring, the icy drive home in his victoria, by moonlight, all the meshes formed from habits of thinking, impressions of the seasons, reactions on the surface of his skin, which had laid over a succession of weeks a uniform net in which his body was now recaptured. At that time, he was satisfying a sensual curiosity by experiencing the pleasures of people who live for love. He had believed he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows; how small a thing Odette's charm was for him now compared with the astounding terror that extended out from it like a murky halo, the immense anguish of not knowing at every moment what she had been doing, of not possessing her everywhere and always! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: 'But I will always be able to see you, I am always free!' she who was never free now! the interest, the curiosity she had shown in his own life, the passionate desire that he should do her the favour which he in fact dreaded in those days as a cause of tiresome inconveniences of allowing her to enter it; how she had been obliged to beg him to let her take him to the Verdurins'; and when he had allowed her to come to him once a month, how she had had to tell him over and over again, before he would let himself give in to her, how delightful it would be to have the habit of seeing each other every day, a habit which she dreamed of whereas to him it seemed only a tedious bother, which she had then grown tired of and broken once and for all, while for him it had become such an irresistible and painful need. He did not know how truthfully he was speaking when, the third time he saw her, as she said to him yet again: 'But why don't you let me come more often?', he had said to her with a laugh, gallantly: 'for fear of being hurt'. Now, alas, she still wrote to him occasionally from a restaurant or hotel on paper that bore its printed name; but now the letters of that name burned him like letters of fire. 'It's written from the Hotel Vouillemont?101 What can she have gone there to do? And with whom? What has been going on there?' He remembered the gas-jets being extinguished along the boulevard des Italiens when he had met her against all hope among the wandering shadows on that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which indeed since it belonged to a time when he did not even have to ask himself if he would vex her by looking for her, by finding her, so sure was he that her greatest joy was to see him and go home with him was truly part of a mysterious world to which one can never return once its doors have closed. And Swann saw, motionless before that relived happiness, a miserable figure who filled him with pity because he did not recognize him right away, and he had to lower his eyes so that no one would see they were full of tears. It was himself. When he realized this, his pity vanished, but he was jealous of the other self she had loved, he was jealous of those of whom he had often said to himself without suffering too much 'maybe she loves them', now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the letterhead of the Maison d'Or, which were full of it. Then his pain became too sharp, he passed his hand over his forehead, let his monocle",3.017796974639372,1.1987764944938257,0.41291443968185765,0.09169477314785877,4.204646017699115,4.0,2.2748481634456237,37.666666666666664,21.5,45.09958117568524,1.2577433628318584,1.0,0.5976963487322023,1808,626,0.34623893805309736,7908,48,59.32188900730591,5.796542867168285e+25,2.811126511720798e+22,0.7293111643892654,0.7381371181134296,62.19824483775814,13.94137168141593,11.538034831475386,17.36755162241888,17.207216076696163,8.137477876106196,53.485250737463126,5.958333333333333,True,1207.0,0.8903976721629486,3.8351115421920468,2062.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008446641944787803,0.004120313143798929,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008034610630407911,0.004532344458178822,0.0,0.004849660523763337,80,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"drop, wiped its glass. And no doubt, if he had seen himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of those which he had singled out for distinction the monocle he was removing like an importunate thought and from whose clouded face, with a handkerchief, he was trying to wipe off his worries. There are tones in a violin if we cannot see the instrument and therefore cannot relate what we hear to our image of it, which changes the sound of it so similar to those of certain contralto voices that we have the illusion a singer has been added to the concert. We lift our eyes, we see only the bodies of the instruments, as precious as Chinese boxes, but at times we are still fooled by the deceptive call of the siren; at times too we think we hear a captive genie struggling deep inside the intelligent, bewitched and tremulous box, like a devil in a holy-water basin; at times, lastly, it is like a pure and supernatural being that passes through the air uncoiling its invisible message. As if the instrumentalists were not so much playing the little phrase as performing the rituals it required in order to make its appearance, and proceeding to the incantations necessary for obtaining and prolonging a few moments the wonder of its evocation, Swann, who could no more see it than if it had belonged to an ultra-violet world, and who was experiencing something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he was struck as he approached it, felt it to be present, like a protective goddess, a confidante of his love, who in order to be able to come to him in the midst of the crowd and take him aside to talk to him, had assumed the disguise of this body of sound. And while it passed, light, soothing, murmured like a perfume, telling him what it had to tell him, as he scrutinized every word, sorry to see them fly off so quickly, he involuntarily made the motion with his lips of kissing the harmonious fleeting body as it passed. He no longer felt exiled and alone since the little phrase was addressing him, was talking to him in a low voice about Odette. For he no longer felt, as he once had, that the little phrase did not know him and Odette. It had so often witnessed their moments of happiness! True, it had just as often warned him how fragile they were. And in fact, whereas in those days he read suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disenchanted intonation, he now found in it instead the grace of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows of which it used to speak to him and which, without being affected by them, he had seen it carry along with it, smiling, in its rapid and sinuous course, of those sorrows which had now become his own, without his having any hope of ever being free of them, it seemed to say to him as it had once said of his happiness: 'What does it matter? It means nothing.' And for the first time Swann's thoughts turned with a stab of pity and tenderness to Vinteuil, to that unknown, sublime brother who must also have suffered so; what must his life have been like? from the depths of what sorrows had he drawn that godlike strength, that unlimited power to create? When it was the little phrase that spoke to him about the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found solace in that very wisdom which, just recently, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought he could read it on the faces of the indifferent people who considered his love an insignificant aberration. For the little phrase, unlike them, whatever its opinion of the brief duration of the conditions of the soul, did not see them as these people did, as something less serious than the events of everyday life, but on the contrary, regarded them as so superior that they alone were worth expressing. These charms of an intimate sadness these were what it sought to imitate, to recreate, and their very essence, even though it is to be incommunicable and to seem frivolous to everyone but the one who is experiencing them, had been captured by the little phrase and made visible. So much so that it caused their value to be acknowledged, and their divine sweetness savoured, by all those same people sitting in the audience if they were at all musical who would afterwards fail to recognize these charms in real life, in every individual love that came into being before their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified them could not be resolved into reasoned arguments. But ever since, more than a year ago now, the love of music had, for a time at least, been born in him, revealing to him many of the riches of his own soul, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable to the intelligence, but not for all that less perfectly distinct from one another, unequal among themselves in value and significance. When, after the Verdurin evening, he had had the little phrase played over for him, and had sought to disentangle how it was that, like a perfume, like a caress, it encircled him, enveloped him, he had realized that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes that composed it, and to the constant repetition of two of them, that was due this impression of a frigid and withdrawn sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was reasoning this way not about the phrase itself but about simple values substituted, for his mind's convenience, for the mysterious entity he had perceived, before knowing the Verdurins, at that party where he had first heard the sonata played. He knew that even the memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the elements of the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable keyboard of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard still almost entirely unknown on which, here and there only, separated by shadows thick and unexplored, a few of the millions of keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity which compose it, each as different from the others as one universe from another universe, have been found by a few great artists who do us the service, by awakening in us something corresponding to the theme they have discovered, of showing us what richness, what variety, is hidden unbeknownst to us within that great unpenetrated and disheartening darkness of our soul which we take for emptiness and nothingness. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, although it might present an obscure surface to one's intelligence, one sensed a content so solid, so explicit, to which it gave a force so new, so original, that those who had heard it preserved it within themselves on the same footing as the ideas of the intellect. Swann referred back to it as to a conception of love and happiness whose distinctive character he recognized at once, as he would that of La Princesse de Cleves or of Rene,102 when their titles returned to his memory. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed latent in his mind in the same way as did certain other notions without equivalents, like the notion of light, of sound, of perspective, of physical pleasure, which are the rich possessions that diversify and ornament the realms of our inner life. Perhaps we will lose them, perhaps they will fade away, if we return to nothingness. But as long as we are alive, we can no more eliminate our experience of them than we can our experience of some real object, than we can for example doubt the light of the lamp illuminating the metamorphosed objects in our room whence even the memory of darkness has vanished. In this way Vinteuil's phrase had, like some theme from Tristan,103 for example, which may also represent to us a certain emotional accretion, espoused our mortal condition, taken on something human that was rather touching. Its destiny was linked to the future, to the reality of our soul, of which it was one of the most distinctive, the best differentiated ornaments. Maybe it is the nothingness that is real and our entire dream is non-existent, but in that case we feel that these phrases of music, and these notions that exist in relation to our dream, must be nothing also. We will perish, but we have for hostages these divine captives who will follow us and share our fate. And death in their company is less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps less probable. Swann was, therefore, not wrong to believe that the phrase of the sonata really existed. Of course, although human from this point of view, it belonged to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom despite this we recognize with delight when some explorer of the invisible manages to capture one, to bring it, from that divine world to which he has access, to shine for a few moments above ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann sensed that the composer had merely unveiled it, made it visible, with his musical instruments, following and respecting its sketched form with a hand so tender, so prudent, so delicate and so sure that the sound altered at every moment, fading away to indicate a shadow, revivified when it had to follow a bolder contour. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of that phrase was that any lover of music with the least discernment would at once have noticed the imposture if Vinteuil, having had less capacity to see and to render its forms, had sought to conceal, by adding lines of his own invention here and there, the lacunae in his vision or the failures of his hand. It had disappeared. Swann knew that it would reappear at the end of the last movement, after a whole long passage that Mme Verdurin's pianist always skipped. There were marvellous ideas in it which Swann had not distinguished at the first hearing and that he perceived now, as if they had divested themselves, in the cloakroom of his memory, of the uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which would enter into the composition of the phrase, like premises in the necessary conclusion; he was attending its",3.4364724637836903,1.1112732751230117,0.43180758308970185,0.050653663285752874,4.4933554817275745,4.0,2.5050801391880775,42.0,38.0,32.189121374832844,1.3449612403100775,1.0,0.7153162019052107,1806,658,0.3643410852713178,8335,43,64.52221900233432,1.0510991209169543e+28,5.200886298451036e+24,0.8396004353250776,0.83524631290901,50.421279069767465,16.660542635658917,14.079733686665573,20.299446290143965,20.73370431893688,9.916168327796232,62.21040974529347,8.488372093023257,True,1134.0,0.8960910440376052,4.124195942602672,2021.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012432165762210163,0.015096201282683769,0.0,0.005937654626422563,81,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"birth. 'O audacity as inspired, perhaps, he said to himself, as that of a Lavoisier, of an Amper104 the audacity of a Vinteuil experimenting, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, guiding and urging on, across a region unexplored, towards the only possible goal, the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he will never see!' The beautiful dialogue which Swann heard between the piano and the violin at the beginning of the last passage! The suppression of human speech, far from letting fantasy reign there, as one might have believed, had eliminated it; never had spoken language been such an inflexible necessity, never had it known such pertinent questions, such irrefutable answers. First the solitary piano lamented, like a bird abandoned by its mate; the violin heard it, answered it as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the beginning of the world, as if there were only the two of them still on the earth, or rather in this world closed to all the rest, constructed by the logic of a creator, this world in which there would never be more than the two of them: this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul of the little phrase, not yet fully formed, was it a fairy this creature invisibly lamenting, whose plaint the piano afterwards tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist had to leap to his bow to collect them. Marvellous bird! the violinist seemed to want to charm it, tame it, capture it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the violinist's body, truly possessed, was shaking like a medium's with the summoned presence of the little phrase. Swann knew it was going to speak one more time. And he had so completely divided himself in two that the wait for the imminent moment when he would find himself confronting it again made him shudder with the kind of sob which a beautiful line of verse or a sad piece of news wring from us, not when we are alone, but if we repeat them to friends in whom we can see ourselves as another person whose probable emotion moves them. It reappeared, but this time to hang in the air and play for a moment only, as though motionless, and afterwards expire. And so Swann lost nothing of this very brief extension of its life. It was still there like an iridescent bubble floating by itself. Like a rainbow, whose brilliance weakens, fades, then rises again, and before dying away altogether, flares up a moment more brilliant than ever: to the two colours it had so far allowed to appear, it added others, variegated chords of every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann did not dare move and would have made all the other people be still too, as if the slightest motion might compromise the fragile, exquisite and supernatural magic that was so close to vanishing. No one, in fact, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable word of one man who was absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know if Vinteuil was still alive), breathing out above the rites of these officiants, was enough to hold the attention of three hundred people, and made of this dais, where a soul had thus been summoned, one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. So that, when the phrase came unravelled at last, floating in shreds in the motifs which followed and had already taken its place, if at first Swann was irritated to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famous for her naive remarks, lean towards him to confide her impressions even before the sonata had ended, he could not keep from smiling, and perhaps also found a deeper meaning that she did not see in the words she used. Awestruck by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: 'It's amazing, I've never seen anything so powerful...' But a scruple for accuracy causing her to correct her first assertion, she added this reservation: 'anything so powerful... since the table-turning!' From this evening on, Swann realized that the feeling Odette had had for him would never return, that his hopes of happiness would never be realized now. And on the days when she happened to be kind and affectionate with him again, if she showed him some thoughtful attention, he would note these ostensible and deceptive signs of a slight renewal of feeling, with the loving, sceptical solicitude, the despairing joy of those who, caring for a friend in the last days of an incurable illness, report certain precious facts such as: 'Yesterday, he did his accounts himself, and he was the one who spotted a mistake in addition that we had made; he ate an egg and enjoyed it if he digests it without any trouble we'll try a cutlet tomorrow,' although they know these facts are meaningless on the eve of an unavoidable death. No doubt Swann was sure that if he had now been living far away from Odette, she would in the end have become unimportant to him, so that he would have been glad if she had left Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain; but he did not have the courage to leave. He had often thought of it. Now that he had gone back to work on his study of Vermeer, he needed to return at least for a few days to The Hague, Dresden, Brunswick. He was convinced that a 'Diana with Her Companions' which had been bought by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicolas Maes, was in reality a Vermeer.105 And he wished he could study the painting on the spot, in order to support his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, or even when she was absent for in new places where our sensations are not dulled by habit, we retemper, we revive an old pain was for him so cruel a plan that he was able to think about it constantly only because he knew he was resolved never to execute it. But sometimes, while he was asleep, the intention of taking the trip would revive in him without his remembering that it was impossible and in his sleep he would take the trip. One day he dreamed he was leaving for a year; leaning out at the door of the railway car towards a young man on the platform who was saying good-bye to him, weeping, Swann tried to convince him to leave with him. The train began to move, his anxiety woke him, he remembered that he was not leaving, that he would see Odette that evening, the next day and almost every day after. Then, still shaken by his dream, he blessed the particular circumstances that had made him independent, because of which he could remain near Odette, and also succeed in getting her to allow him to see her now and then; and, recapitulating all these advantages his position; his fortune, from which she was too often in need of assistance not to shrink from contemplating a definite break with him (having even, people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her); his friendship with M. de Charlus, which in truth had never helped him obtain much from Odette, but gave him the comfort of feeling that she heard flattering things about him from this mutual friend for whom she had such great esteem; and lastly even his intelligence, which he employed entirely in contriving a new intrigue every day that would make his presence, if not agreeable, at least necessary to Odette he thought about what would have become of him if he had not had all this, he thought that if, like so many other men, he had been poor, humble, wretched, obliged to accept any sort of work, or tied to relatives, to a wife, he might have been obliged to leave Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so close to him, might have been true, and he said to himself: 'You don't know it when you're happy. You're never as unhappy as you think. '106 But he calculated that this life had already gone on for several years, that all he could hope for now was that it would go on for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, finally his whole life to the daily expectation of a meeting that could bring him no happiness, and he wondered if he was not deceiving himself, if the circumstances that had favoured his love affair and kept it from ending had not been bad for the course of his life, if the desirable outcome would not in fact have been the one which, to his delight, had taken place only in a dream: for him to have gone away; he told himself that you don't know it when you're unhappy, that you are never as happy as you think. Sometimes he hoped she would die in an accident without suffering, she who was outside, in the streets, on the roads, from morning to night. And when she returned safe and sound, he marvelled that the human body was so supple and so strong, that it continued to ward off, to outwit all the perils which surrounded it (and which Swann found innumerable now that his secret desire had computed them) and so allowed people to abandon themselves daily and almost with impunity to their work of mendacity, their pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt very close in his heart to Mohammed II, whose portrait by Bellini he liked so much, who, realizing that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her in order, as his Venetian biographer ingenuously says, to recover his independence of mind. Then he would be filled with indignation that he should be thinking thus only of himself, and the sufferings he had endured would seem to him to deserve no pity since he himself had placed so low a value on Odette's life. Unable to separate from her irrevocably, if he had at least been able to see her without any separations, his pain would in the end have abated and perhaps his love would have died. And if she did not want to leave Paris for ever, he would have liked her never to leave Paris. At least since he knew that her only long absence was the yearly one in August and September, he had ample opportunity several months in advance to dissolve the bitter idea of it in all the Time to come which he carried within him in anticipation and which, composed of days",3.377349165797231,1.339623177354528,0.44494831482640673,0.06141264304736044,4.351636161952301,4.0,2.318157925884522,40.06666666666667,29.0,40.551969400045444,1.2972823072656683,1.0,0.6537814758308361,1803,658,0.3649473100388242,8109,45,60.50978852281153,1.9013727113478058e+26,9.302214830468717e+22,0.770587151192806,0.7810306720608888,56.41725013865782,15.343931225734888,12.457975602129121,18.68889628397116,19.099539656128677,9.048851913477534,57.81486411536329,7.111111111111111,True,1154.0,0.886986301369863,3.9672211350293543,2044.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01392673327278232,0.005045917852457362,0.005045917852457362,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005247754566555657,0.0024220405691795337,0.0,0.003424657534246575,82,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"identical with those of the present, flowed through his mind transparent and cold, sustaining his sadness, but without causing him too sharp a pain. But that interior future, that colourless free-flowing river, was suddenly assaulted by a single remark of Odette's which entered Swann and, like a piece of ice, immobilized it, hardened its fluidity, made it freeze entirely; and Swann suddenly felt he was filled with an enormous infrangible mass that pressed on the inner walls of his being till it nearly burst: what Odette had said, observing him with a sly smiling glance, was: 'Forcheville is going to be taking a lovely trip, at Pentecost. He's going to Egypt,' and Swann had immediately understood that this meant: 'I'm going to Egypt at Pentecost with Forcheville.' And in fact, if several days after, Swann said to her: 'Look, about this trip you told me you would be taking with Forcheville,' she would answer thoughtlessly: 'Yes, my dear boy, we're leaving the 19th, we'll send you a view of the Pyramids.' Then he wanted to know if she was Forcheville's mistress, he would want to ask her directly. He knew that, being as superstitious as she was, there were certain perjuries she would not commit, and, too, the fear, which had restrained him up to this point, of irritating Odette by questioning her, of making her hate him, had vanished now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her. One day he received an anonymous letter telling him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it mentioned, among them Forcheville, M. de Breaute and the painter), and of women too, and that she frequented houses of ill repute. He was tormented by the thought that among his friends there was an individual capable of sending him this letter (because certain details revealed that the person who had written it had an intimate knowledge of Swann's life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any feelings of suspicion about the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he tried to find out whether it was beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or M. des Laumes, or M. d'Orsan, that he ought to situate the unknown region in which this ignoble act must have been conceived, since none of these men had ever spoken in praise of anonymous letters in his presence and since everything they had said to him implied that they condemned them, he saw no reason for connecting this infamy with the character of one rather than another. That of M. de Charlus was a little deranged but basically good and affectionate; that of M. des Laumes, a little hard, but sound and straightforward. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who in even the most dismal circumstances would approach him with a more heartfelt remark, a more discreet and more appropriate gesture. So much so that he could not understand the rather indelicate role people ascribed to M. d'Orsan in the love affair he was having with a rich woman, and that each time Swann thought of him, he was obliged to thrust to one side that bad reputation which was so irreconcilable with the many clear proofs of his delicacy. For a moment Swann felt his mind was darkening and he thought about something else in order to recover a little light. Then he had the courage to return to these reflections. But now, after being unable to suspect anyone, he had to suspect everyone. True, M. de Charlus was fond of him, had a good heart. But he was a neurotic, tomorrow he might weep at the news that Swann was ill, and today, out of jealousy, out of anger, acting in the grip of some sudden idea, he had wanted to hurt him. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. Of course, the Prince des Laumes was not nearly as fond of Swann as M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he did not have the same susceptibilities with regard to him; and then although his was undoubtedly a cold nature, he was as incapable of base actions as of great ones. Swann regretted that in his life he had not formed attachments exclusively to such people. Then he mused that what prevents men from doing harm to their fellow men is goodness of heart, that really he could answer only for men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart was concerned, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing such pain to Swann would have revolted him. But with an insensitive man, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how could one foresee the actions to which he might be led by motives that were so different in essence? To have a kind heart is everything, and M. de Charlus had one. M. d'Orsan was not lacking in heart either and his cordial but not very close relationship with Swann, arising from the pleasure which, since they thought the same way about everything, they found in talking together, was more secure than the excitable affection of M. de Charlus, capable of committing acts of passion, good or bad. If there was anyone by whom Swann had always felt himself understood and liked in a discriminating way, it was by M. d'Orsan. Yes, but what about this dishonourable life he was leading? Swann regretted never having taken it into account properly, having often confessed as a joke that he had never experienced such keen feelings of sympathy and respect as in the company of a scoundrel. It is not for nothing, he said to himself now, that when men judge another man, it is by his actions. They alone mean something, and not what we say, or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have their faults, but they are still honest men. Orsan perhaps has none, but he is not an honest man. He may have acted badly yet one more time. Then Swann suspected Remi, who, it was true, could merely have inspired the letter, but for a moment he felt he was on the right track. In the first place Loredan had reasons for resenting Odette. And then how can we help but imagine that our servants, living in a situation inferior to ours, adding to our wealth and our weaknesses imaginary riches and vices for which they envy and despise us, will find themselves inevitably led to act in a way different from the people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. Each time Swann had asked a favour of him, had he not always refused? And then with his bourgeois ideas he might have thought he was acting for Swann's own good. Swann also suspected Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins, admired once more in passing the wisdom of society people in not wanting to mix in those artistic circles in which such things are possible, perhaps even openly admitted as good pranks; but he recalled certain honest traits in those bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expediency, almost of fraudulence, into which the lack of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures so often drive members of the aristocracy. In short, this anonymous letter proved that he knew an individual capable of villainy, but he could see no more reason why that villainy should be hidden in the bedrock unexplored by any other person of the character of the affectionate man rather than of the cold man, the artist rather than the bourgeois, the great lord rather than the valet. What criterion should one adopt for judging men? Really there was not a single person among those he knew who might not be capable of infamy. Was it necessary to stop seeing all of them? His mind clouded over; he passed his hands across his forehead two or three times, wiped the lenses of his lorgnon with his handkerchief and, thinking that after all men as good as himself associated with M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the others, he said to himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of infamy, at least that it is a necessity of life to which each of us submits, to associate with people who are perhaps not incapable of it. And he continued to shake hands with of all those friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that they had perhaps tried to drive him to despair. As for the actual substance of the letter, he did not worry about it, because not one of the accusations formulated against Odette had a shadow of likelihood. Swann, like many people, had a lazy mind and lacked the faculty of invention. He knew very well as a general truth that people's lives are full of contrasts, but for each person in particular he imagined the whole part of his life that he did not know as being identical to the part that he knew. He imagined what he was not told with the help of what he was told. During the times when Odette was with him, if they were talking about some indelicate act committed or some indelicate feeling experienced by someone else, she would stigmatize them by virtue of the same principles that Swann had always heard professed by his parents and to which he had remained faithful; and then she would arrange her flowers, she would drink a cup of tea, she would worry about Swann's work. And so Swann extended these habits to the rest of Odette's life, he repeated these gestures when he wanted to picture to himself the times when she was far away from him. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been with him for so long, but in the company of another man, he would have suffered, because that image would have appeared to him quite likely. But that she went to procuresses, took part in orgies with other women, that she led the dissolute life of the most abject creatures what an insane aberration, for the realization of which, God be thanked, the imagined chrysanthemums, the successive teas, the virtuous indignation left no room! Only from time to time, he would insinuate to Odette that, out of spite, someone had been reporting to him about everything she did; and, making use, in connection with this, of an insignificant but true detail, which he had learned by chance, as if it were the sole fragment among many others",3.194275094292564,0.9267307647820612,0.43020063230034905,0.06948799660877282,4.418475236505286,4.0,2.38354900419454,30.982758620689655,25.0,21.832822001013586,1.3038397328881468,1.0,0.6630830949333202,1797,609,0.33889816360601,8222,58,59.575261266271575,7.468050153321872e+25,3.668001057623709e+22,0.8169158237022266,0.7910739678357329,65.0826585976628,11.878584710149099,11.51570030376865,15.175518584614204,14.872397674284727,9.225264329437948,49.34669852052271,5.689655172413793,True,1103.0,0.8904715127701375,4.038310412573674,2036.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01197365795250449,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004789463181001796,0.010377170225503891,0.006385950908002395,0.011787819253438114,83,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"that he had allowed to slip out despite himself, of a complete reconstruction of Odette's life which he kept hidden inside himself, he would lead her to suppose that he was well informed about things that in reality he did not know or even suspect, for if quite often he adjured Odette not to alter the truth, it was only, whether he realized it or not, so that she would tell him everything she did. Undoubtedly, as he said to Odette, he loved sincerity, but he loved it as a procuress who could keep him in touch with his mistress's life. And so his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not made him a better person. The truth he cherished was the truth Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to obtain that truth, was not afraid to resort to falsehood, that very same falsehood which he constantly portrayed to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. And so he lied as much as Odette because, while unhappier than she, he was no less selfish. And she, hearing Swann tell her the things she had done, would gaze at him with a look of mistrust, and put a touch of vexation into her expression just in case, so as not to look humiliated, as though blushing at her actions. One day, during the longest period of calm he had yet been able to go through without suffering renewed attacks of jealousy, he had agreed to go to the theatre that evening with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened the newspaper, in order to find out what was being played, the sight of the title, Les Filles de Marbre by Theodore Barriere,107 struck him such a painful blow that he recoiled and turned his head away. Illuminated as though by footlights, in the new spot where it had appeared, the word 'marble', which he had lost the ability to distinguish because he was so used to seeing it before his eyes, had suddenly become visible again and had immediately reminded him of the story Odette had told him once long ago, about a visit she had made to the Salon du Palais de l'Industrie with Mme Verdurin, where the latter had said to her: 'Watch yourself, now! I know how to melt you. You're not made of marble, you know.' Odette had sworn to him it was only a joke, and he had attached no importance to it. But he had had more confidence in her at that time than he did now. And in fact the anonymous letter mentioned love affairs of that kind. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper again, he unfolded it, turned a page in order not to see the words 'Les Filles de Marbre', and mechanically began reading news from the provinces. There had been a storm on the Channel, damage was reported at Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval. Immediately he recoiled again. The name Beuzeval had reminded him of the name of another place in the same area, Beuzeville, whose name is joined by a hyphen to another, Breaute, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever noticing before that it was the same as that of his friend M. de Breaute, whom the anonymous letter mentioned as having been Odette's lover. In fact, in the case of M. de Breaute, the accusation was not unlikely; but so far as Mme Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette sometimes lied, one could not conclude that she never told the truth and, in the remarks she had exchanged with Mme Verdurin and which she herself had described to Swann, he had recognized those pointless and dangerous jokes made, from inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, by women whose innocence they merely reveal and who like Odette for example are least prone to feel passionate love for another woman. Whereas on the contrary, the indignation with which she had denied the suspicions she had involuntarily aroused in him for a moment by her story squared with all he knew about his mistress's tastes and temperament. But at this moment, through one of those inspirations common to jealous men, analogous to that which reveals to a poet or scientist who has still only one rhyme or one observation the idea or law that will give them all their effective power, Swann recalled for the first time a remark Odette had made to him fully two years before: 'Oh, Mme Verdurin! all she can think about these days is me. I'm her little pet. She kisses me, and she wants me to go shopping with her, and she wants me to call her tu. '108 Far from seeing, at the time, any sort of connection between this comment and the absurd remarks meant to simulate some sort of depravity which Odette had reported to him, he had welcomed it as proof of a warm friendship. Now the memory of Mme Verdurin's affection had suddenly come to join the memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind and saw them mingled in reality too, the affection lending something serious and important to the jokes which in return caused the affection to lose some of its innocence. He went to Odette's house. He sat down at a distance from her. He did not dare kiss her, not knowing whether it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke, either in her, or in himself. He said nothing, he watched their love die. Suddenly he made up his mind. Odette, he said to her, my dear, I know I'm being hateful, but there are a few things I must ask you. Do you remember the idea I had about you and Mme Verdurin? Tell me, was it true, with her or with anyone else? She shook her head pursing her lips, a sign people often use to answer that they will not go, that it bores them, if someone asks: 'Would you like to come watch the cavalcade go past, will you be at the review?' But a shake of the head thus usually assigned to an event in the future, for this reason colours with some uncertainty the denial of an event that is past. What is more it suggests only reasons of personal propriety rather than reprobation, a moral impossibility. When he saw Odette make this sign to him that it was untrue, Swann understood that it was perhaps true. I've already told you. You know perfectly well, she added, looking irritated and unhappy. Yes, I know, but are you sure? Don't say, 'You know perfectly well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any woman. She repeated, as though it were a lesson, ironically, and as if she wanted to get rid of him: I have never done anything of that sort with any woman. Can you swear it on your medal of Our Lady of Laghet? Swann knew Odette would never swear a false oath on that medal. Oh, you make me so unhappy! she exclaimed, abruptly dodging the grasp of his question. Aren't you done yet? What's the matter with you today? Are you determined to make me hate you, to make me detest you? You see? I wanted to have a nice time with you again, the way we used to, and this is how you thank me! However, not letting her go, like a surgeon waiting for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but will not make him abandon it: You're quite wrong to imagine I would hold it against you in the least, Odette, he said to her with a persuasive and deceptive gentleness. I only talk to you about what I know, and I always know much more about it than I say. But only you can mitigate by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger towards you does not come from your actions, I forgive you for everything because I love you, but from your duplicity, the absurd duplicity which makes you persist in denying things I know already. How can you expect me to go on loving you when I see you insisting upon, swearing to, something I know is untrue? Odette, don't prolong this moment which is agony for us both. If you want to, you can end it in a second, you'll be free of it for ever. Tell me on your medal, yes or no, if you have ever done these things. But I have no idea, she exclaimed angrily, maybe a very long time ago, without realizing what I was doing, maybe two or three times. Swann had envisaged all the possibilities. Reality is therefore something that has no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in our body has any relation to the gradual motions of the clouds over our head, since those words 'two or three times' carved a kind of cross in the tissue of his heart. Strange that the words 'two or three times', no more than words, words spoken into the air, at a distance, can lacerate the heart this way as if they had really touched it, can make you as sick as if you had swallowed poison. Involuntarily Swann thought of the remark he had heard at Mme de Saint-Euverte's: 'That's the most powerful thing I've seen since the table-turning.' This pain he was experiencing was like nothing he had believed. Not only because in the hours when he most entirely distrusted her he had rarely imagined such an extremity of evil, but because, even when he did imagine this thing, it remained vague, uncertain, not clothed in the particular horror that had escaped with the words 'maybe two or three times', not armed with that specific cruelty as different from everything he had known as a disease with which one is stricken for the first time. And yet Odette, from whom all this harm came to him, was no less dear to him, quite the contrary, more precious, as if at the same rate that his suffering increased, the value of the sedative increased, of the antidote which only this woman possessed. He wanted to devote more care to her, as to a disease which one suddenly discovers is more serious. He wanted the frightful thing she had told him she had done 'two or three times' not to be repeated. For this, he had to watch over Odette. People often say that when we inform a friend of his mistress's wrongdoings, we succeed only in attaching him to her more",2.944807702651314,1.022884279132772,0.42839234903569945,0.06847943106204422,4.220865704772475,4.0,2.272268694921531,24.684931506849313,18.0,19.590937737476093,1.2708102108768036,1.0,0.6267460038366904,1802,600,0.33296337402885684,7911,73,63.92207523990066,5.767725040680212e+27,2.787687308206966e+24,0.7641355163521237,0.7395863998943651,74.26925068037039,9.032683776017517,10.013029886694916,12.226913779210314,10.792743222903013,7.819578246392894,41.16661852127773,4.068493150684931,True,1170.0,0.8806186563557274,3.8235862735621073,2069.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03284934610235815,0.02976006590464422,0.016682113067655237,0.011327360724951087,0.011327360724951087,0.011327360724951087,0.008649984553599012,0.006178560395427865,0.009267840593141797,0.008699855002416627,84,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"closely because he places no faith in them, but how much more so if he does place faith in them! But, said Swann to himself, how could he manage to protect her? He could perhaps keep her safe from a particular woman, but there were hundreds of others, and he realized what madness had come over him when he had begun, on the evening when he had not found Odette at the Verdurins', to want something that was always impossible to possess another person. Happily for Swann, underneath the new sufferings that had just entered his soul like hordes of invaders, there lay a natural foundation, older, gentler and silently industrious, like the cells of an injured organ that immediately set about preparing to mend the damaged tissues, like the muscles of a paralysed limb that try to resume their former movements. For a time, these older, more autochthonous inhabitants of his soul employed all Swann's strength in this dim restorative work that gives one an illusion of repose while convalescing, after an operation. This time it was not so much, as it usually was, in Swann's brain that this slackening due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and like a dying animal shaken one last time by the throes of a convulsion which seemed to have ended, on Swann's heart, spared for a moment, the same suffering returned of its own volition to cut the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings when, lying back in the victoria that was taking him to the rue La Perouse, he would voluptuously cultivate within himself the emotions of a man in love, without knowing the poisoned fruit they would necessarily bear. But all these thoughts did not last more than the space of a second, the time he took to bring his hand to his heart, catch his breath and manage a smile to hide his agony. Already he was beginning to ask his questions again. For his jealousy, which had taken pains an enemy would not have taken to strike this blow, to introduce him to the most intense suffering he had yet known, did not believe he had suffered enough and sought to expose him to a wound that was deeper still. Thus, like a wicked deity, his jealousy inspired Swann and pushed him to his ruin. It was not his fault but only Odette's if at first his torment did not grow worse. My dear, he said to her, it's in the past now. Was it with anyone I know? No, of course not, I swear it wasn't. And anyway, I think I exaggerated, I don't think I went that far. He smiled and went on: As you like. It doesn't really matter, but it's too bad you can't tell me the name. If I could picture the person it would keep me from ever thinking about her again. I say this for your own sake, because I wouldn't be bothering you about it any more. It's such a relief to be able to picture a thing! The truly horrifying things are the ones you can't imagine. But you've already been so kind, I don't want to tire you. I do thank you with all my heart for all the good you've done me. I'm quite finished now. Only this last question: 'How long ago was it?' Oh, Charles! Don't you see you're killing me? It's all so long ago. I never gave it another thought. And now it's as if you're positively trying to put those ideas in my head again. A lot of good it'll do you, she said, with unthinking foolishness and deliberate spite. Oh, I only wanted to know if it had happened since I've known you! It would be natural enough. Did it happen here? Could you tell me which particular evening, so that I could picture what I was doing at the time? I'm sure you realize it isn't possible that you don't remember who it was with, Odette, my love. Oh I don't know, really, I think it was in the Bois one evening when you came to meet us on the island. You had had dinner with the Princesse des Laumes, she said, happy to give him a specific detail that would attest to her truthfulness. There was a woman at the next table; I hadn't seen her for ages. She said to me: 'Come around behind that little rock there and see how the moonlight looks on the water.' At first I just yawned and said: 'No, I'm tired and I'm quite comfortable where I am.' She swore there had never been such moonlight. I said to her: 'I've heard that sort of story before!' I knew quite well what she was after. Odette told this almost with a smile, either because it seemed to her quite natural, or because she thought she would thereby make it seem less important, or so as not to appear humiliated. At the sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone: You're a scoundrel, you like tormenting me, making me invent lies which I only tell you so that you'll leave me in peace. This second blow which Swann suffered was even more agonizing than the first. Never had he supposed the thing had been so recent, hidden from his eyes that had not been able to discover it, not in a past which he had not known, but among evenings which he recalled so clearly, which he had experienced with Odette, which he had believed he knew so well and which now assumed in retrospect an appearance that was two-faced and agonizing; among them suddenly there opened up this wide gap, this moment on the island in the Bois. Odette, without being intelligent, had the charm of naturalness. She had described, she had mimed this scene with such simplicity that Swann, breathless, saw everything: Odette's yawn, the little rock. He heard her answer gaily, alas! : 'I've heard that sort of story before!' He felt she would say nothing more this evening, there was no new revelation to expect just now; he said to her: 'My poor dear, forgive me, I feel I'm hurting you, it's over and done with, I'm not thinking about it any more.' But she saw that his eyes were still dwelling on the things he did not know and on that past of their love, monotonous and sweet in his memory because it was vague, which was now being torn open like a wound by that minute on the island in the Bois, in the moonlight, after the dinner with the Princesse des Laumes. But he was so much in the habit by now of finding life interesting of admiring the curious discoveries one can make that even while suffering to the point of believing he could not endure such pain for long, he said to himself: 'Life is really astonishing; it really has great surprises in store for us; immorality is actually more common than one would think. Here's a woman I trusted, who seemed so simple, so honest in any case, even if she was rather flighty, who seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes; after an unlikely denunciation I question her, and the little she admits reveals much more than what one would have suspected.' But he could not confine himself to these disinterested remarks. He tried to estimate the exact value of what she had told him, in order to know if he ought to conclude that she had done these things often, that they would happen again. He repeated to himself the words she had said: 'I knew quite well what she was after', 'Two or three times', 'I've heard that sort of story before!', but they did not reappear in Swann's memory disarmed, each of them held a knife and with it struck him another blow. For a very long time, just as an invalid cannot stop himself from trying over and over again to make the motion that is painful to him, he repeated these words to himself: 'I'm quite comfortable here', 'I've heard that sort of story before!', but the pain was so intense he had to stop. He marvelled that acts which he had always judged so superficially, so gaily, had now become as serious as a moral illness. He certainly knew some women he could have asked to keep an eye on Odette. But how could he hope they would adopt the same point of view he now had and not hold on to the point of view he had had for so long, that had always guided him in love affairs, would not say to him, laughing: 'You nasty jealous man trying to rob others of a little pleasure'? By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who in the past had derived only refined pleasures from his love for Odette) been roughly dropped into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he would ever get out? Poor Odette! He did not hold it against her. She was only half guilty. Didn't people say it was her own mother who had handed her over to a rich Englishman in Nice when she was hardly more than a child? But what painful truth was now contained for him in those lines from Journal d'un Poete by Alfred de Vigny109 which he had read with indifference in the past: 'When you feel you are falling in love with a woman, you ought to say to yourself: Who are her friends? What sort of life has she had? All one's future happiness depends upon it.' Swann was surprised that simple statements spelled out by his mind, like 'I've heard that sort of story before!', 'I could see very well what she was after' could hurt him so. But he realized that what he believed to be simple statements were merely parts of the framework that still contained, and could give back to him, the pain he had felt during Odette's story. For it was indeed the same pain which he was feeling again. For all that he now knew for all that he had even, as time passed, forgotten a little, forgiven the moment he said these words to himself again, the old suffering made him once again what he had been before Odette spoke: ignorant, trustful; his cruel jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be wounded by Odette's confession, in the position of a man who does not yet know, and after several months this old story still upset him like a revelation. He admired the terrible recreative power of his memory.

"was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes with age, that he could hope for an easing of his torment. But as soon as the power of any one of Odette's remarks to make him suffer seemed nearly exhausted, then one of those on which Swann's mind had dwelt less until then, a remark that was almost new, would come to relieve the others and strike at him with undiminished vigour. The memory of the evening when he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was only the core of his disease. The latter spread confusedly on all sides through the days before and after it. And whatever point in it he tried to touch in his memories, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had dined so often on the island in the Bois, that hurt him. Hurt him so badly that gradually the curiosity which his jealousy kept provoking in him was neutralized by his fear of the new torments he would inflict on himself by satisfying it. He realized that the entire period of Odette's life that had elapsed before she met him, a period he had never tried to picture, was not the abstract expanse which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of specific years, each filled with concrete incidents. But if he came to know them, he was afraid that that past of hers, colourless, fluid and tolerable, might assume a body that was tangible and loathsome, a face that was individual and diabolical. And he continued to refrain from trying to imagine it, no longer from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that one day he might at last be able to hear the name of the island in the Bois, of the Princesse des Laumes, without feeling the old tearing at his heart, and thought it would be imprudent to provoke Odette into supplying him with new remarks, names of places, different circumstances which, when his illness was still scarcely abated, would reawaken it again in another form. But often the things he did not know, that he now was afraid of knowing, were revealed spontaneously by Odette herself, and without her realizing it; in fact the distance that depravity put between Odette's real life and the relatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and quite often still believed, his mistress led, was a distance whose extent Odette did not realize: a depraved person, still affecting the same virtue in front of the people by whom he does not want his vices to be suspected, has no gauge by which to recognize how far the latter, whose continuous growth is imperceptible to himself, are drawing him little by little away from normal ways of living. As they cohabited, deep in Odette's mind, with the memory of the acts she was hiding from Swann, other actions were gradually coloured by them, infected by them, without her being able to see anything strange about them, without their seeming out of place in the particular surroundings where she kept them inside her; but if she described them to Swann, he was horrified by the revelation of the environment they betrayed. One day he was trying, without hurting Odette, to ask her if she had ever had any dealings with a procuress. Actually he was convinced she had not; reading the anonymous letter had introduced the conjecture into his mind, but in a mechanical way; it had met with no credence there, but had in fact remained there, and Swann, in order to be rid of the purely material but nonetheless awkward presence of the suspicion, wanted Odette to remove it. 'Oh, no! Not that they don't pester me,' she added, revealing by her smile a self-satisfied vanity which she no longer noticed could not seem legitimate to Swann. 'There was one here yesterday who stayed more than two hours waiting for me, offered me any amount I liked. It seems some ambassador had said to her: ""I'll kill myself if you don't get her for me."" They told her I'd gone out. In the end I went and talked to her myself so she would leave. I wish you could have seen the way I spoke to her; my maid heard me from the next room and told me I was shouting at the top of my voice. I said, ""Haven't I told you I don't want to? I don't like the idea of it at all. Really, I should hope I'm still free to do what I want! If I needed the money, I could understand..."" The concierge has orders not to let her in again. He'll tell her I'm in the country. Oh, I wish you had been hiding somewhere. I think you would have been pleased, my dear. You see, your little Odette has some good in her, all the same, even though some people find her so hateful.' What was more her very admissions, when she made them to him, of faults that she supposed he had discovered, rather served Swann as points of departure towards new doubts than put an end to the old. For they were never exactly proportional to the latter. Though Odette might subtract from her confession all the essential part, there remained in the accessory part something Swann had never imagined, that crushed him with its newness and would enable him to change the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could no longer forget. His soul bore them along, cast them aside, cradled them, like dead bodies. And it was poisoned by them. One time she told him about a visit Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcia fete. 'What? you already knew him back then? Yes, of course, that's right,' he said, catching himself so as not to show that he had not known. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that on the day of the Paris-Murcia fete, on which he had received from her the letter he had kept so carefully, she had perhaps been having lunch with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore she had not. 'Yet the Maison d'Or does remind me of something or other that I knew at the time wasn't true,' he said in order to frighten her. 'Yes, that I hadn't actually been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there and you had been looking for me at Prevost's,' she answered (thinking from his expression that he knew this), with a decisiveness in which there was, not cynicism, but rather timidity, a fear of vexing Swann, which out of self-respect she wanted to hide, and also a desire to show him that she could be frank. Thus she struck with an executioner's neatness and vigour though quite without cruelty, for Odette was not conscious of the harm she was doing Swann; and she even began to laugh, perhaps, it is true, chiefly so as not to seem humiliated, embarrassed. 'It's quite true that I hadn't been to the Maison Doree; I was coming away from Forcheville's house. I actually had been to Prevost's, I didn't make that up, and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his engravings. But someone else came to see him. I told you I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I was afraid you would be annoyed. See? That was rather kind of me, wasn't it? Even if I was wrong, at least I'm telling you all about it now quite frankly. What would I gain by not telling you I had lunch with him the day of the Paris-Murcia fete, if it was true? Especially since at the time we didn't know each other very well yet, you and I, dear.' He smiled at her with sudden cowardice, changed by these crushing words into a creature without strength. So, even during the months which he had never dared to think about again because they had been too happy, during those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that time (the first evening they had 'made cattleya') when she had told him she was coming from the Maison Doree, how many others there must have been, each of them also harbouring a lie which Swann had not suspected. He remembered that one day she had said to him: 'I would simply tell Mme Verdurin my dress wasn't ready, or my cab came late. There's always a way to manage it.' From him too, probably, many times when she had murmured the sorts of words which explain a delay, justify a change in the hour of a meeting, they must have concealed, without his suspecting it then, something she was going to do with some other man, with some other man to whom she had said: 'I'll simply tell Swann my dress wasn't ready, or my cab came late. There's always a way to manage it.' And under all Swann's sweetest memories, under the simplest words Odette had said to him in the old days, which he had believed like the words of the gospel, under the daily actions she had recounted to him, under the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's house, the avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he sensed, concealed within the surplus time which even in the most thoroughly itemized days still leaves some play, some room, and can serve as hiding places for certain actions, he sensed insinuating itself the possible subterranean presence of lies which made something ignoble out of all that had remained most dear to him (his best evenings, the rue La Perouse itself, which Odette must always have left at other hours than those she had reported to him), propagating everywhere a little of the dark horror he had felt when he heard her admission about the Maison Doree, and, like the loathsome beasts in the Desolation of Nineveh,110 toppling stone by stone his entire past. If he now turned away each time his memory spoke the bitter name of the Maison Doree, it was because what it recalled to him now was no longer, as still quite recently at Mme de Saint-Euverte's party, a happiness he had long since lost, but an unhappiness he had only just discovered. Then the same thing happened with the name of the Maison Doree as with that of the island in the Bois, it gradually ceased to hurt Swann. For what we believe to be our love, or our jealousy, is not one identical and continuous passion, indivisible. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies,",3.09407567074347,1.2553245908575028,0.4385974363158231,0.06694710109114131,4.257760532150776,4.0,2.2200384218611733,26.925373134328357,19.0,27.496167131989925,1.2522172949002217,1.0,0.5825631161243509,1804,601,0.33314855875831484,8033,67,64.19796686949611,7.600160448064552e+27,3.631228116609915e+24,0.7696143068147429,0.7671568964536374,73.56816312009799,9.687059602210677,9.786861456521276,12.787887612933117,12.086738673594333,8.13629711751663,42.33557269086938,4.149253731343284,True,1194.0,0.8805542283803154,3.8380315336837074,2093.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.04444218448082986,0.03427234821519373,0.031933285874097425,0.026644971015966645,0.026644971015966645,0.016068341299705073,0.01159361334282518,0.008135869012508899,0.005186616495474423,0.004300047778308648,86,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"don't often find. I can tell you besides, that if you don't know it, you're the only one who doesn't. Mme Verdurin told me as much herself on our very last day (you know, when you're about to leave you always have the best talks): 'I'm not saying Odette doesn't care a great deal for us, but whatever we might say to her wouldn't have much weight compared to what M. Swann might say.' Oh, my Lord! The driver's stopping for me here I've been chatting away with you and I nearly went right past the rue Bonaparte... Would you be so kind as to tell me if my plume is straight? And Mme Cottard withdrew from her muff and held out to Swann a hand gloved in white from which escaped, along with a transfer ticket, a vision of upper-class life that filled the omnibus, mingling with the smell of the dry cleaner. And Swann felt himself overflowing with affection for her, as much as for Mme Verdurin (and almost as much as for Odette, since the feeling he now had for the latter, being no longer mingled with pain, was hardly love any more), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with his newly affectionate eyes as she courageously made her way up the rue Bonaparte, her plume high, her skirt lifted in one hand, holding in the other her sunshade and her card case with its monogram displayed, while her muff danced in front of her. To compete with the morbid feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme Cottard, a better healer than her husband would have been, had grafted alongside them other feelings, normal ones, of gratitude, friendship, feelings which in Swann's mind would make Odette more human (more like other women, because other women too could inspire these feelings in him), would hasten her final transformation into the Odette who was loved with a peaceful affection, who had brought him back one evening after a party at the painter's home to drink a glass of orangeade with Forcheville and with whom Swann had glimpsed the possibility of living in happiness. Having in the past often thought with terror that one day he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had promised himself to be vigilant and, as soon as he felt his love was beginning to leave him, to cling to it, to keep hold of it. But now, corresponding to the weakening of his love there was a simultaneous weakening of his desire to remain in love. For one cannot change, that is to say become another person, while continuing to acquiesce to the feelings of the person one no longer is. Now and then a name glimpsed in a newspaper, that of one of the men he thought could have been Odette's lovers, restored his jealousy to him. But it was very mild and as it proved to him that he had not yet completely emerged from the time when he had suffered so much but also when he had experienced such voluptuous sorts of feelings and that the hazards of the road ahead might still permit him to catch a furtive, distant glimpse of its beauties, this jealousy actually gave him a pleasant thrill just as to the sad Parisian leaving Venice to return to France a last mosquito proves that Italy and the summer are not yet too remote. But most often, when he made the effort, if not to remain in this quite distinctive period of his life from which he was emerging, at least to have a clear view of it while he still could, he would notice that already he no longer could; he would have liked to observe as though it were a landscape about to disappear that love which he had just left behind; but it is so difficult to duplicate oneself and give oneself a truthful display of a feeling one no longer has that soon, darkness gathering in his brain, he could no longer see anything, gave up looking, took off his lorgnon, wiped its lenses; and he said to himself that it would be better to rest a little, that there would still be time later on, and would settle back with the incuriosity, the torpor of the drowsy traveller who pulls his hat down over his eyes in order to sleep in the railway carriage which he feels carrying him faster and faster, away from the country where he has lived for so long and which he had promised himself not to let slip past without giving it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller if he does not wake until he is back in France, when Swann happened upon proof close at hand that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he noticed that he felt no pain, that his love was far away by now, and he was sorry not to have been warned of the moment when he was about to leave it behind for ever. And just as before kissing Odette for the first time he had tried to imprint on his memory the face which had been familiar to him for so long and which was about to be transformed by the memory of that kiss, so he would have wanted, in his thoughts at least, to have been able to make his farewells, while she still existed, to the Odette who had inspired him with love, jealousy, to the Odette who had made him suffer and whom he would now never see again. He was mistaken. He did see see her again, one more time, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme Verdurin, Doctor Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he could not identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path that followed the sea and overhung it steeply sometimes very high up, sometimes by a few metres only, so that one climbed and descended again constantly; those who were descending again were already no longer visible to those who were still climbing, what little daylight remained was failing and it seemed as though darkest night was about to descend on them at any moment. Now and again the waves leaped right up to the edge and Swann felt sprays of icy water on his cheek. Odette told him to wipe them off, he could not and was embarrassed by this in front of her, as he was embarrassed to be in his nightshirt. He hoped that in the darkness no one would realize, but Mme Verdurin stared at him with a look of surprise for a long moment during which he saw her face change shape, her nose lengthen, and that she had a large moustache. He turned away to look at Odette, her cheeks were pale, with little red spots, her features drawn, ringed with shadows, but she was looking at him with eyes full of tenderness that were about to separate from her like teardrops and fall on him, and he felt he loved her so much that he wanted to take her away at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, looked at a little watch and said: 'I have to go,' she said good-bye to everyone, in the same manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where she would see him again that evening or another day. He did not dare ask her, he would have liked to follow her and was obliged, without turning back towards her, to answer with a smile some question of Mme Verdurin's, but his heart was pounding horribly, he felt he hated Odette, he would have liked to cut out those eyes of hers that he had loved so much just a moment ago, crush those pallid cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme Verdurin, which meant that with each step he moved farther away from Odette, who was descending in the opposite direction. After one second, it was many hours ago that she had left them. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had vanished an instant after she had. 'They certainly must have arranged it together, he added. They must have met at the bottom of the hill, but they didn't want to say good-bye at the same time for the sake of appearances. She's obviously his mistress.' The unknown young man began to cry. Swann tried to comfort him. 'Really, she's doing the right thing, he told him, drying his eyes and taking off his fez so that he would be more comfortable. I told her a dozen times she should do it. Why be sad about it? He above all would understand her.' Thus did Swann talk to himself, for the young man he had not been able to identify at first was also himself; like certain novelists, he had divided his personality between two characters, the one having the dream, and another he saw before him wearing a fez. As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification in the Baron's usual physiognomy, lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour on his chest, had induced him to give this name; but in reality, and in everything which the character in the dream represented to him and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from incomplete and changing images the sleeping Swann drew false deductions, having for the moment as well such creative power that he reproduced himself by simple division like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought he was clasping, and from feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, devised peripeteias of a sort which, through their logical linking, would produce at just the right moment in Swann's sleep the person required to receive his love or prompt his awakening. In an instant utter darkness descended on him, an alarm sounded, inhabitants passed by running, escaping from houses in flames; Swann heard the sound of the waves leaping and his heart, with the same violence, pounding with anxiety in his chest. Suddenly the palpitations of his heart redoubled in speed, he felt an inexplicable pain and nausea; a countryman covered with burns flung at him as he passed: 'Come and ask Charlus where Odette ended up this evening with her friend, he used to go about with her in the old days and she tells him everything. It's them that started the fire.' It was his valet who had come to wake him and who said: Monsieur, it's eight o'clock and the hairdresser",3.116183939018851,1.3634953317903498,0.4408380992074574,0.08841238819350117,4.257760532150776,4.0,2.1794674475825513,38.38297872340426,26.0,38.550631637339556,1.2394678492239468,1.0,0.5564327948411679,1804,626,0.34700665188470065,7950,47,58.968755198214495,4.071973915320363e+25,2.002938472858024e+22,0.7712895304126584,0.7621626070390145,63.017296551398786,14.005082322970235,10.720730343779639,17.19354625654574,17.815541468132288,8.464456762749446,54.07034014247299,6.0212765957446805,True,1152.0,0.8986719134284309,3.910477127397934,2033.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016205128205128205,0.009641025641025642,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005333333333333333,0.005333333333333333,0.005846153846153846,0.007870142646335464,88,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"which are ephemeral but by their uninterrupted multitude give the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the faithfulness of his jealousy, were formed of the death, the faithlessness, of numberless desires, numberless doubts, all of which had Odette as their object. If he had remained for a long time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow Swann's heart with affection and suspicion by turns. On certain evenings she would suddenly be full of kindness towards him again, and she would warn him severely that he ought to take advantage of it right away, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; they had to go back to her house immediately to 'make cattleya', and this desire which she claimed to feel for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the caresses she lavished on him at these times so demonstrative and so unusual that this brutal and improbable fondness made Swann as unhappy as a lie or an unkindness. One evening when he had once again gone home with her in obedience to her command, and she was kissing him and murmuring to him with a passion quite unlike her usual coldness, he suddenly thought he heard a noise; he stood up, looked everywhere, found no one, but did not have the courage to go back to his place next to her, whereupon she, in a paroxysm of rage, broke a vase and said to Swann: 'One can never do anything right with you!' And he remained uncertain whether she had not hidden someone there with the desire of provoking the man's jealousy or inflaming his senses. Sometimes he visited brothels hoping to learn something about her, though without daring to say her name. 'I have a nice little one I know you'll like,' the madam would say. And he would stay there for an hour chatting gloomily to some poor girl who was astonished that he did nothing more. One who was very young and beautiful said to him one day: 'What I'd like would be to find a man who would be a real friend to me; then he could be quite certain I'd never go with another man again. Really, do you believe it's possible for a woman to be touched that a man loves her, and never be unfaithful to him? Swann asked her anxiously. Well, of course! But it would depend on her character, wouldn't it now?' Swann could not help saying to these girls the same sorts of things that would have pleased the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was looking for a friend, he said, smiling: 'How nice you've put on blue eyes to match the colour of your belt. And you too; you've got blue cuffs on. What a lovely conversation we're having, for this sort of a place! I'm not boring you, am I? Perhaps you've got something else you have to do? No, I have plenty of time. If you were boring me, I would have told you. Actually, I like listening to you talk. I'm very flattered. Aren't we having a nice chat? he said to the madam, who had just come in. Why yes, that's just what I was saying to myself. How well they're behaving! There! Now they come to my house to talk. The Prince said it himself, the other day, it's much nicer here than at his wife's house. It seems that in high society these days all the women put on such airs, it's a real scandal! But I'll leave you alone, I know when to be discreet.' And she left Swann with the girl who had blue eyes. But soon he stood up and said good-bye, she did not matter to him, she did not know Odette. Because the painter had been ill, Doctor Cottard had advised him to go to sea for a while; several of the regulars talked about going along with him; the Verdurins could not reconcile themselves to being left alone, rented a yacht, then became the purchasers of it and so Odette went on frequent cruises. Each time she had been gone for a little while, Swann felt he was beginning to separate from her, but as if this mental distance were proportional to the physical distance, as soon as he knew Odette was back, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, having gone off for only a month, as they thought, either because they were tempted along the way, or because M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged things beforehand to please his wife and had informed the regulars only as they proceeded, from Algiers they went to Tunis, then to Italy, then to Greece, to Constantinople, to Asia Minor. The voyage had lasted close to a year. Swann felt absolutely calm, almost happy. Even though Mme Verdurin had tried to persuade the pianist and Doctor Cottard that the aunt of the one and the patients of the other did not need them at all and that in any case it was imprudent to let Mme Cottard return to Paris, which M. Verdurin assured them was in the midst of a revolution, she was obliged to give them back their freedom at Constantinople. And the painter left with them. One day, shortly after the three travellers111 returned, Swann, seeing an omnibus go by heading for the Luxembourg, where he had business, had jumped inside and found himself sitting across from Mme Cottard, who was making the rounds of the people whose 'day' it was in full dress uniform, ostrich feather in hat, silk dress, muff, combination umbrella-sunshade, calling-card case and freshly cleaned white gloves. Clothed in these insignia, when it was dry out she would go on foot from one house to the next in the same neighbourhood, but for proceeding into a different neighbourhood would use the omnibus with connection service. During the first few minutes, before the woman's native kindness perforated the starch of the petty bourgeoise, and also not very sure if she ought to talk about the Verdurins to Swann, she produced quite naturally, in her awkward, slow, soft voice which at times the omnibus drowned out completely with its rattling, remarks chosen from among those she heard and repeated in the twenty-five houses whose storeys she climbed during one day: I don't need to ask you, Monsieur, if a man in-the-swim such as yourself has gone to the Mirlitons,112 to see the portrait by Machard113 which the whole of Paris is rushing to see? Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who approve or those who don't? It's the same in every house now, all they talk about is the portrait by Machard; you aren't fashionable, you aren't really cultured, you aren't up-to-date, unless you can give your opinion of Machard's portrait. Swann answered that he had not see the portrait, and Mme Cottard was afraid she had offended him by obliging him to confess it. Well, good, at least you admit it frankly, you don't think you're disgraced because you haven't seen Machard's portrait. I think that's admirable. Well now, I have seen it. Opinion is divided, you know, some people think there's too much polish in it, too much whipped cream, but I think it's just right. Of course she's not like the blue-andyellow women by our friend Biche. But I must confess to you frankly, though you will not find me very fin-de-siecle, but I do say what I think I don't understand his work. Good Lord, I can see the good points in his portrait of my husband, it's not as strange as what he usually does, but even so he had to go and put a blue moustache on him. Whereas Machard! Imagine, the husband of the friend I'm on my way to see at this moment (giving me the great pleasure of riding with you) has promised her that, if he's elected to the Academy (he's one of the doctor's colleagues) he'll have her portrait done by Machard. Obviously they're dreaming! I have another friend who claims she likes Leloir114 better. I'm just a poor layman and perhaps Leloir is even superior technically. But I think the most important quality in a portrait, especially when it's going to cost 10,000 francs, is that it should be a good likeness, and pleasant to look at. Having made these remarks, which were inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card case, the little number inked inside her gloves by the dry cleaner and the difficulty of talking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme Cottard, seeing that they were still far away from the corner of the rue Bonaparte where the driver was to let her off, listened to her heart, which counselled other words. Your ears must have been burning, Monsieur, she said, during the voyage we made with Mme Verdurin. We talked of nothing else but you. Swann was very surprised, he assumed his name was never mentioned in the presence of the Verdurins. Anyway, added Mme Cottard, Mme de Crecy was there, and that says it all. Wherever Odette is, she can never go for very long without mentioning you. And as you may expect she does not speak ill of you. What! You doubt it? she said, seeing Swann make a gesture of scepticism. And carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, and imputing no unfavourable meaning to the word, which she used only in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection between friends: Why, she adores you! Oh, I'm sure one couldn't say anything against you in front of her! One would be in a fine fix! Apropos of anything at all, if we saw a painting, for instance, she would say: 'Now, if he were here, he'd be able to tell us whether it was genuine or not. There's nobody like him for that.' And she was constantly asking: 'What can he be doing right now? If only he would do a little work! It's dreadful that a fellow with such gifts should be so lazy.' (You'll forgive me, won't you?) 'I can see him right now, he's thinking about us, he's wondering where we are.' She even made a remark that I found quite charming: M. Verdurin said to her: 'How in the world can you see what he's doing right now, since you're eight hundred leagues away?' And Odette answered: 'Nothing is impossible for the eye of a friend.' No I swear, I'm not saying it just to flatter you, you have a true friend in her such as you",2.5988315777726445,0.9296882739674479,0.4285140071926676,0.08562967435825046,4.2196467991169975,4.0,2.243039340340056,20.82758620689655,13.0,21.3117025197084,1.2483443708609272,1.0,0.560985529591377,1812,622,0.3432671081677704,8069,87,67.66628795610518,2.4383467770575304e+29,1.1330607700081461e+26,0.7077318220291027,0.7050314003930372,80.08506622516559,7.263222196848599,8.971697999119087,10.339864504833677,8.858329527289335,7.590331125827813,37.7150034254396,3.5172413793103448,True,1216.0,0.8689591078066915,3.74953531598513,2152.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006687607660350593,0.0018238929982774344,0.0,0.01254646840148699,87,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"is here, I've told him to come by again in an hour. But these words, penetrating the swells of sleep in which Swann was plunged, had reached his consciousness only by suffering that deflection which causes a ray of light in the depths of water to appear to be a sun, just as a moment earlier the sound of the doorbell, assuming in the depths of those abysses the sonority of an alarm, had begotten the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scene before his eyes turned to dust, he opened his eyes, heard one last time the sound of a wave of the sea as it receded. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could recall the sensation of the cold water and the taste of the salt. He got up, dressed. He had asked the hairdresser to come early because he had written to my grandfather the night before that he would be going to Combray in the afternoon, having learned that Mme de Cambremer Mlle Legrandin was spending a few days there. Associating in his memory the charm of that young face with the charm of a countryside he had not visited in such a long time, he found that together they offered him an attraction that had made him decide to leave Paris for a few days at last. Because the different chance events which bring us into contact with certain people do not coincide with the time during which we are in love with them, but, extending beyond it, may occur before it begins and repeat themselves after it has ended, the earliest appearances in our lives of a person destined later to captivate us assume retrospectively in our eyes the significance of a warning, a presage. This was how Swann had often looked back at the image of Odette when he met her at the theatre, that first evening when he did not dream he would ever see her again and how he now recalled the party at Mme de Saint-Euverte's where he had introduced General de Froberville to Mme de Cambremer. We have such numerous interests in our lives that it is not uncommon, on a single occasion, for the foundations of a happiness that does not yet exist to be laid down alongside the intensification of a grief from which we are still suffering. And undoubtedly this could have happened to Swann elsewhere than at Mme de Saint-Euverte's. Who knows, even, had he found himself elsewhere, that evening, if other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which afterwards would have appeared to him to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had decided to go to Mme de Saint-Euverte's party, because his mind, wanting to admire life's richness of invention and incapable of posing itself a difficult question for very long, such as the question of what was most to be wished for, believed that in the sufferings he had experienced that evening and in the pleasures still unsuspected that were already germinating between which the balance was too difficult to establish there was a sort of necessary connection. But while, an hour after he had woken, he was giving instructions to the hairdresser to see that his haircut would not become tousled on the train, he thought about his dream again, and saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pale complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, everything which in the course of the successive expressions of tenderness which had made of his abiding love for Odette a long oblivion of the first image he had formed of her he had ceased to notice since the earliest days of their acquaintance, days to which no doubt, while he slept, his memory had returned to search for their exact sensation. And with the intermittent coarseness that reappeared in him as soon as he was no longer unhappy and the level of his morality dropped accordingly, he exclaimed to himself: 'To think that I wasted years of my life, that I wanted to die, that I felt my deepest love, for a woman who did not appeal to me, who was not my type!' PART III: Place-names: the Name Among the bedrooms whose images I summoned up most often in my nights of insomnia, none resembled less the rooms at Combray, dusted with an atmosphere that was grainy, pollinated, edible and devout, than the room at the Grand-Hotel de la Plage, at Balbec, whose enamel-painted walls contained, like the polished sides of a swimming-pool which tints the water blue, a pure azure salt sea air. The Bavarian decorator who had been commissioned to furnish the hotel had varied the design schemes of the rooms and on three sides, along the walls, in the one I was occupying, had placed low bookcases, with glass panes, in which, depending on the spot they occupied, and by an effect he had not foreseen, one or another part of the changing picture of the sea was reflected, unfurling a frieze of bright seascapes, which was interrupted only by the solid pieces of mahogany. So much so that the whole room had the look of one of those model dormitories presented in 'modern style'1 furniture shows, where they are hung with works of art assumed to be likely to delight the eyes of the person who will be sleeping there, and representing subjects in keeping with the type of site where the room will be found. But nothing resembled less this real Balbec, either, than the one I had often dreamed of, on stormy days, when the wind was so strong that Francoise as she took me to the Champs-Elysees warned me not to walk too close to the walls or the tiles might fall on my head and moaned to me about the great disasters and shipwrecks reported in the newspapers. I had no greater desire than to see a storm at sea, not so much because it would be a beautiful spectacle as because it would be a moment of nature's real life unveiled; or rather for me there were no beautiful spectacles except the ones which I knew were not artificially contrived for my pleasure, but were necessary, unchangeable the beauties of landscapes or of great art. I was curious, I was avid to know only those things which I believed to be more real than myself, which had for me the value of showing me a little of the mind of a great genius, or of the force or grace of nature as it is manifested when left to itself, without the interference of men. In the same way that the lovely sound of her voice, reproduced in isolation by the phonograph, would not console us for having lost our mother, so a storm mechanically imitated would have left me as indifferent as the illuminated fountains at the Exposition.2 And so that the storm would be absolutely real, I also wanted the shore itself to be a natural shore, not a pier recently created by some municipality. In fact, because of all the feelings it awakened in me, nature seemed to me the thing most opposite to the mechanical productions of men. The less it bore their imprint the more room it offered in which my heart could expand. Now, I had remembered the name Balbec, which had been mentioned to us by Legrandin, as that of a seaside resort very close to 'those funereal cliffs, famous for their many wrecks, wrapped six months of the year in a shroud of fog and the foam of the waves'. 'You can still feel there beneath your feet, he said, far more so than at Finistere itself3 (and even though hotels are being superimposed upon it now without, however, the power to change the more ancient skeleton of the land), you can still feel the true end of the land of France, of Europe, of the Ancient World. And it's the last encampment of fishermen, precisely like all the fishermen who have ever lived since the beginning of the world, facing the eternal realm of the mists of the sea and shadows of the night. One day when, at Combray, I had mentioned this seaside resort of Balbec in the presence of M. Swann in order to find out from him if it was the choicest spot for seeing the most powerful storms, he had answered me: 'Yes indeed I certainly know Balbec! The church at Balbec, built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, still half Romanesque, is perhaps the most curious example of our Norman Gothic, and so singular! It's almost Persian in style.' And that region, which until then had seemed to me similar in nature to the immemorial, still contemporaneous great phenomena of geology and just as completely outside human history as the Ocean itself or the Great Bear,4 with those wild fishermen for whom, no more than for the whales, there had been no Middle Ages it had been a great delight for me to see it suddenly take its place in the sequence of the centuries, now that it had experienced the Romanesque period, and to know that the Gothic trefoil had come at the proper time to pattern those wild rocks too, like the frail but hardy plants which, when spring comes, spangle here and there the polar snow. And if the Gothic brought to these places and to these men a definition which they lacked, they too conferred one upon it in return. I tried to picture how these fishermen had lived, the timid and undreamed-of attempt at social relations which they had made there, during the Middle Ages, clustered on a point along the shores of Hell, at the foot of the cliffs of death; and the Gothic seemed to me more alive now that, having separated it from the towns in which until then I had always imagined it, I could see how, in a particular case, on wild rocks, it had germinated and flowered into a delicate steeple. I was taken to see reproductions of the most famous of the statues at Balbec the fleecy snub-nosed apostles, the Virgin from the porch and my breathing stopped in my chest for joy when I thought that I could see them modelled in relief against the eternal briny mist. Then, on the sweet stormy evenings of February, the wind blowing a plan into my heart, which trembled under its gusts no less powerfully than my bedroom chimney, a plan to go to Balbec mixed in me a desire",3.697700291995037,1.4432931795406332,0.42719131751861594,0.08694685975420301,4.353038674033149,4.0,2.4103148836372656,46.41025641025641,44.0,30.876692685848088,1.2922651933701657,1.0,0.6524038477057027,1810,698,0.3856353591160221,8099,39,64.35614418132099,8.902629392652504e+27,4.4203720916844607e+24,0.784179105178306,0.7797842809074634,50.40295438447376,17.75872928176796,13.233081621884743,21.260235160787648,22.277940359824335,9.158077348066296,63.59257685224536,7.9743589743589745,True,1113.0,0.9036742800397219,4.0213505461767625,2014.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017577533084149916,0.013334680270734417,0.0050510152540660675,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01575916759268613,0.0030306091524396404,0.003939791898171533,0.012413108242303872,89,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"for Gothic architecture with my desire for a tempest at sea. I would have liked to leave the very next day on the handsome and generous one-twenty-two train, whose hour of departure I could never read without a palpitating heart, in the railway company's advertisements, in announcements for circular tours: it seemed to me to incise at a precise point in the afternoon a delectable notch, a mysterious mark from which the diverted hours, though they still led to the evening, to the next morning, led to an evening and morning which one would see, not in Paris, but in one of those towns through which the train passes and among which it permitted us to choose; for it stopped at Bayeux, at Coutances, at Vitre, at Questambert, at Pontorson, at Balbec, at Lannion, at Lamballe, at Benodet, at Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and moved on magnificently overloaded with proffered names among which I did not know what one I would have preferred, so impossible was it to sacrifice any of them. But without even waiting for it, I could have, by dressing quickly, left that very evening, if my parents had allowed me, and arrived at Balbec when the morning twilight was rising over the furious sea, from whose volleys of foam I would take refuge in the Persian-style church. But at the approach of the Easter holidays, when my parents promised to let me spend them for once in the north of Italy, now, in place of those dreams of tempests by which I had been so entirely occupied, wanting to see only waves running in from all sides, higher and higher, on the wildest coast, near churches as steep and rugged as cliffs, from whose towers the sea birds would shriek, now suddenly erasing them, taking away all their charm, excluding them because they were its opposite, and could only have weakened it, the converse dream now occupied me, of the most dappled spring, not the spring of Combray which still pricked us tartly with all the needles of the frost, but the spring which was already covering the fields of Fiesole with lilies and anemones and dazzling Florence with golden grounds like those of Fra Angelico. From then on, only sunlight, perfumes, colours seemed to me of any value; for this alternation of images had brought about a change of front in my desire, and as abrupt as those that occur now and then in music a complete change of tone in my sensibility. Then it came about that a simple variation in the atmosphere was enough to provoke this modulation in me without any need to wait for the return of a season. For often in one season we find a day that has strayed from another and that immediately evokes its particular pleasures, lets us experience them, makes us desire them, and interrupts the dreams we were having by placing, earlier or later than was its turn, this leaf detached from another chapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness. But soon, like those natural phenomena from which our comfort or our health can derive only an accidental and rather slender benefit until the day when science seizes hold of them, and producing them at will, puts into our hands the possibility of their appearance, withdrawn from the guardianship and exempted from the consent of chance, in the same way the production of those dreams of the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to be subjected solely to the changes of the seasons and of the weather. I needed only, to make them reappear, to pronounce those names Balbec, Venice, Florence in the interior of which had finally accumulated the desire inspired in me by the places they designated. Even in spring, finding the name of Balbec in a book was enough to awaken in me the desire for storms and Norman Gothic; even on a stormy day the name of Florence or Venice gave me a desire for the sun, for lilies, for the Palace of the Doges and for Saint-Mary-of-the-Flowers.5 But if these names absorbed for ever the image I had of these towns, it was only by transforming that image, by subjecting its reappearance in me to their own laws; in consequence of this they made it more beautiful, but also more different from what the towns of Normandy or Tuscany could be in reality, and, by increasing the arbitrary joys of my imagination, aggravated the future disappointment of my travels. They exalted the idea I was forming of certain places on the earth, by making them more particular, consequently more real. I did not at the time represent to myself cities, landscapes, monuments as more or less pleasant pictures, cut out here and there from the same material, but each of them as an unknown thing, different in essence from the others, a thing for which my soul thirsted and which it would profit from knowing. How much more individuality still did they assume from being designated by names, names that were theirs alone, proper names like the names people have. Words present us with clear and familiar little pictures of things like the pictures hung on the walls of schools to give children an example of what a workbench is, a bird, an anthill, things conceived of as similar to all others of the same sort. But names present a confused image of people and of towns, which they accustom us to believe are individual, unique like people an image which derives from them, from the brightness or darkness of their tone, the colour with which it is painted uniformly, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely red, in which, because of the limitations of the process used or by a whim of the designer, not only the sky and the sea are blue or red, but the boats, the church, the people in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns I had most wanted to visit, ever since I had read La Chartreuse,6 seeming to me compact, smooth, mauve and soft, if anyone mentioned a certain house in Parma in which I would be staying, he gave me the pleasure of thinking I would be living in a house that was smooth, compact, mauve and soft, that bore no relation to the houses of any real town in Italy, since I had composed it in my imagination using only that heavy syllable, Parme, in which no air circulates, and the Stendhalian softness and tint of violets with which I had permeated it. And when I thought of Florence, I thought of a town miraculously fragrant and like the petals of a flower, because it was known as the city of lilies and its cathedral as Saint-Mary-of-the-Flowers. As for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on a piece of old Norman pottery that retains the colour of the earth from which it was taken, one can still see depicted the representation of some outmoded custom, of some feudal right, of some locality in an earlier condition, of an abandoned habit of pronunciation which had formed its heteroclite syllables and which I did not doubt I would rediscover spoken there even by the innkeeper who would serve me coffee with milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch the furious sea in front of the church and to whom I would ascribe the disputatious, solemn and medieval aspect of a character from a fabliau.7 If my health improved and my parents allowed me, if not to go to stay in Balbec, at least to take just once, in order to acquaint myself with the architecture and landscapes of Normandy or Brittany, that one-twenty-two train which I had boarded so many times in my imagination, I would have wished by preference to stop in the most beautiful towns; but compare them as I might, how could I choose, any more than between individual people, who are not interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty in its noble red-tinged lace, its summit illuminated by the old gold of its last syllable; Vitre, whose acute accent barred its ancient glass with black wood lozenges;8 gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness goes from eggshell yellow to pearl grey; Coutances, a Norman cathedral, which its final, fat, yellowing diphthong crowns with a tower of butter; Lannion with the sound, in its village silence, of the coach followed by the fly;9 Questambert, Pontorson, naive and ridiculous, white feathers and yellow beaks scattered along the road to those poetic river spots; Benodet, a name scarcely moored, which the river seems to want to carry away among its algae; Pont-Aven, a pink-and-white flight of the wing of a lightly poised coif reflected trembling in the greeny waters of a canal; Quimperle, more firmly attached, ever since the Middle Ages, among the streams about which it babbles as they bead it with a pearly grisaille like that which is sketched, through the spiderwebs of a stained-glass window, by rays of sunlight which have turned into blunted points of burnished silver? These images were false for another reason also; namely that they were necessarily quite simplified; doubtless whatever it was that my imagination aspired to and that my senses took in only incompletely and without any immediate pleasure, I had enclosed in the sanctuary of a name; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams, these names now magnetized my desires; but names themselves are not very spacious; the most I could do was include in them two or three of the towns' principal curiosities, which would be juxtaposed there with nothing to connect them; in the name Balbec, as in the magnifying glass of the penholders you buy at a seaside resort, I saw waves rising around a Persian-style church. Perhaps indeed the simplification of these images was one of the reasons they came to have such a hold on me. When my father decided, one year, that we would go to spend the Easter holidays in Florence and Venice, not having enough room to insert into the name Florence the elements that usually make up a town, I was forced to produce a supernatural city from the fecundation, by certain springtime fragrances, of what I believed to be, in its essence, the spirit of Giotto. At the very most and because one cannot attach to a name much more time than space like certain of Giotto's paintings themselves which show us the same figure at two different moments in the action, here lying in his bed, there getting ready to mount his horse, the name Florence was divided into two compartments. In one, under an architectural canopy, I was contemplating a fresco on part of which was superimposed a curtain of morning sunlight, dusty,",4.287928998206136,1.6910218730395046,0.4777165002924113,0.0477640639745221,4.507135016465423,4.0,2.488327001215038,79.21739130434783,55.0,78.91655280255331,1.3172338090010978,1.0,0.6888793849606774,1822,696,0.38199780461031835,8446,23,66.16234353448856,5.41926897370745e+28,2.6383977476667233e+25,0.91808835755695,0.9122586931501117,14.991367584594101,30.84814155490861,16.39362981844241,34.409239727008064,39.40730157972606,10.328298572996708,99.30520689161457,15.91304347826087,True,1094.0,0.8880233690360273,4.111976630963973,2054.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014835057583447199,0.0074175287917235995,0.0035135662697638103,0.0035135662697638103,0.0,0.0,0.0111262931875854,0.0035135662697638103,0.0,0.01314508276533593,90,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"oblique and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since I did not think of names as an inaccessible ideal but as a real atmosphere into which I was going to immerse myself, the life not yet lived, the pure and intact life that I enclosed in them gave to the most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the attraction they have in the works of the primitives), I was walking quickly the sooner to reach the lunch that was waiting for me with fruits and wine from Chianti across a Ponte Vecchio crowded with jonquils, narcissus and anemones. That (even though I was in Paris) was what I saw, and not what was actually around me. Even from a simple realistic point of view, the countries we long for occupy a far larger place in our actual life, at any given moment, than the country in which we happen to be. Doubtless, had I myself paid more attention at the time to what was in my mind when I pronounced the words go to Florence, to Parma, to Pisa, to Venice, I would have realized that what I saw was not a town at all, but something as different from anything I knew, something as delightful, as might be, for a human race whose whole life had passed in late afternoons of winter, that unknown marvel: a spring morning. These images, unreal, fixed, always alike, filling my nights and my days, differentiated this period of my life from those that had gone before it (and might have been confused with it in the eyes of an observer who sees things only from outside, that is to say who sees nothing), as in an opera a melodic motif introduces something new that one could not have suspected if one had only read the libretto, still less if one had remained outside the theatre only counting the quarter-hours as they passed. And besides, even from this point of view, of mere quantity, in our lives the days are not all equal. As they travel through the days, temperaments that are at all nervous, as mine was, have available to them, like automobiles, different speeds. There are arduous mountainous days that one spends an infinite time climbing, and downward-sloping days that one can descend at full tilt singing. During that month in which I replayed over and over like a melody, without ever becoming sated, those images of Florence, Venice and Pisa for which the desire they excited in me retained something as profoundly individual as if it had been love, love of a person I did not cease to believe that they corresponded to a reality independent of me, and they introduced me to a hope as beautiful as that which a Christian of the earliest era might have nourished on the eve of entering Paradise. Thus without my worrying about the contradiction of wanting to look at and touch with the organs of my senses what I had created in a day-dream and not perceived with my senses though all the more tempting to them in consequence, more different from anything they knew it was whatever reminded me of the reality of these images that most inflamed my desire, because it was a sort of promise that my desire would be gratified. And, even though the motive for my exhilaration was a desire for artistic delights, the guidebooks sustained it even more than the books about aesthetics, and still more than the guidebooks, the railway time-table. What moved me was to think that if this Florence which I saw near but inaccessible in my imagination was separated from me, in myself, by a crossing that was not viable, I could reach it indirectly, by a detour, by taking the land route. Certainly when I repeated to myself, thus giving so much value to what I was going to see, that Venice was 'the school of Giorgione, the home of Titian, the most complete museum of medieval domestic architecture',10 I felt happy. Yet I was even happier when, out on an errand and walking quickly because of the weather, which, after a few days of precocious spring, had turned back into winter (like the weather we usually found at Combray in Holy Week) seeing on the boulevards that the chestnut trees, though plunged in a glacial atmosphere as liquid as water, were nonetheless beginning, punctual guests, already in formal dress and admitting no discouragement, to round and chisel the frozen masses of irresistible greenery whose steady growth the abortive power of the cold might hinder but could not restrain I thought that already the Ponte Vecchio was abundantly strewn with hyacinths and anemones and the spring sunshine was already dyeing the waves of the Grand Canal with so dark an azure and such noble emeralds that when they came to break at the feet of Titian's paintings, they might rival them in richness of colour. I could no longer contain my joy when my father, even as he consulted the barometer and deplored the cold, began to find out which would be the best trains, and when I realized that by making our way after lunch into that charcoal laboratory, that magic chamber charged with working the complete transmutation of all its surroundings, we could wake the next morning in the city of marble and gold 'bossed with jasper and paved with emeralds'.11 So that it and the City of Lilies were not merely fictive pictures which one could set up at will before one's imagination, but existed at a certain distance from Paris that one absolutely had to cross if one wanted to see them, at a certain determined place on the earth, and at no other, in a word were quite real. They became even more so for me, when my father, by saying: 'So, you could stay in Venice from April 20th to the 29th and arrive in Florence on Easter morning' made them both emerge no longer merely from abstract Space, but from that imaginary Time in which we situate, not one journey at a time but others simultaneously, without too much emotion since they are only possibilities that Time which recreates itself so effectively that we can spend it again in one town after we have spent it in another and devoted to them some of those specific days which are the certificate of authenticity of the objects on which one employs them, for those unique days are consumed by use, they do not come back, one cannot live them here when one has lived them there; I felt that it was towards the week which began on the Monday when the washerwoman was to bring back the white waistcoat I had covered with ink that the two Queen Cities were heading, to become absorbed in it as they emerged from that ideal time in which they did not yet exist, the two Queen Cities of which I was soon going to be able, by the most moving kind of geometry, to inscribe the domes and towers on the map of my own life. But I was still merely on the way to the last degree of bliss; I reached it finally (for only then did the revelation come to me that on those splashy streets, reddened by reflections from Giorgione's frescoes,12 it was not, as I had, despite so many admonitions, continued to imagine, men 'majestic and terrible as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood-red cloaks'13 who would be walking through Venice next week, on the eve of Easter, but that I myself might be the minuscule figure, in a large photograph of St Mark's that had been lent to me, whom the illustrator represented, in a bowler hat, in front of the porches), when I heard my father say: 'It must be quite cold, still, on the Grand Canal; you would do well to put your winter overcoat and your heavy jacket in your trunk just in case.' At these words I was lifted into a kind of ecstasy; I felt myself to be truly making my way, as I had until then thought impossible, between those 'rocks of amethyst like a reef in the Indian Ocean';14 by a supreme feat of gymnastics beyond my strength, divesting myself, as of a useless carapace, of the air of my bedroom that surrounded me, I replaced it by equal parts of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere as indescribable and particular as the atmosphere of dreams, which my imagination had enclosed in the name of Venice, I felt myself undergoing a miraculous disincarnation; it was immediately accompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has come down with a severe sore throat, and they had to put me to bed with a fever so tenacious that the doctor declared they would not only have to give up the idea of allowing me to leave for Florence and Venice now but, even when I was entirely well again, spare me for at least a year any plans for travelling and any cause of excitement. And also, alas, he forbade them absolutely to allow me to go to the theatre to hear La Berma; the sublime artist, whom Bergotte had regarded as a genius, would have, by introducing me to something that was perhaps as important and as beautiful, consoled me for not having been to Florence and Venice, for not going to Balbec. They had to confine themselves to sending me to the Champs-Elysees every day under the supervision of a person who would keep me from tiring myself, and that was Francoise, who had entered our service after the death of my Aunt Leonie. To go to the Champs-Elysees was unbearable to me. If only Bergotte had described it in one of his books, I probably would have wanted to get to know it, like all the things whose 'double' someone had begun by putting into my imagination. It warmed them, made them live, gave them a personality, and I wanted to find them again in reality; but in this public garden nothing was attached to my dreams. One day, because I was bored in our usual spot, next to the merry-go-round, Francoise had taken me on an excursion beyond the frontier guarded at equal intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar sellers into those neighbouring but foreign regions where the faces are unfamiliar, where the goat cart passes; then she had gone back to get her things from her chair, which stood with its back to a clump of laurels; as I waited for her, I was trampling the broad lawn, sparse and shorn, yellowed by the sun, at the far end of which a",4.257195402641137,1.1074193970244706,0.43433992271175476,0.0451151207981031,4.361172566371682,4.0,2.39781822776596,75.33333333333333,52.0,57.382246576987754,1.2925884955752212,1.0,0.6543847537078987,1808,687,0.3799778761061947,8145,24,63.42277152329726,3.500738731818998e+27,1.7313247931844698e+24,0.8879669153172037,0.8948006331920624,21.018679941002972,29.042544247787607,15.303640083715688,32.54483775811209,36.77778945427729,9.450774336283185,93.08775811209439,13.375,True,1129.0,0.8981206726013847,4.028189910979228,2022.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004223227752639517,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005530417295123178,0.0018099547511312218,0.0,0.005934718100890208,91,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"skater, her arms opened wide as she came forward smiling, as if she wanted to take me into them. 'Brava! Brava! That was very good. I would say, as you do, that it was capital, first-rate, if I were not from another age, if I were not from the Ancien Regime,' cried the old lady, speaking in the name of the silent Champs-Elysees to thank Gilberte for having come without letting herself be intimidated by the weather. 'You're like me, faithful to our old Champs-Elysees despite everything; we're two brave souls, you and I. I tell you I love it, even this way. This snow you'll laugh at me reminds me of ermine!' And the old lady began to laugh. The first of these days to which the snow, the image of the powers that could stop me from seeing Gilberte, imparted the sadness of a day of separation and even the aspect of a day of departure because it changed the face and almost prevented the use of the customary site of our only encounters, now changed, all wrapped in covers this day, however, caused my love to progress, for it was like a first sorrow that she had shared with me. There were only the two of us out of all our gang, and to be thus the only one there with her was not only like a beginning of intimacy, but also on her part as though she had come out only for me, in such weather it seemed to me as touching as if on one of those days when she was invited to a party she had given it up to come to find me in the Champs-Elysees; I gained more confidence in the vitality and the future of our friendship, which remained hardy in the midst of the numbness, loneliness and ruin of the things around us; and while she put snowballs down my neck, I smiled with emotion at what seemed to me both a preference she was showing me by tolerating me as her travelling companion in this new and wintry land, and also a sort of loyalty she was cherishing for me in the midst of misfortune. Soon one after the other, like hesitant sparrows, her friends arrived all black against the snow. We began to play, and since this day so sadly begun was to end in joy, when I went up, before playing prisoners' base, to the friend with the sharp voice whom I had heard the first day shouting the name Gilberte, she said to me: 'No, no, we know perfectly well you'd rather be on Gilberte's side, besides look, she's signalling to you.' She was indeed calling me to come to join her camp on the snowy lawn, which the sun, giving it glimmers of pink, the metallic worn surface of an old brocade, was turning into a Field of the Cloth of Gold.18 That day which I had so dreaded was, in fact, one of the only ones on which I was not too unhappy. For, though I now thought of nothing else but of not going a single day without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once when my grandmother had not returned by dinner time, I could not help saying to myself immediately that if she had been run over by a carriage, I would not be able to go to the Champs-Elysees for a long time; we no longer love anyone else when we are in love), yet those moments when I was with her and which since the day before I had been awaiting so impatiently, for which I had trembled, for which I would have sacrificed everything else, were in no way happy moments; and I knew it very well for they were the only moments in my life on which I concentrated a meticulous, fierce attention, and that attention did not discover in them one atom of pleasure. All the time I was away from Gilberte, I needed to see her because, constantly trying to form a picture of her for myself, in the end I could not do it, and no longer knew precisely what the thing was to which my love corresponded. And then she had never yet told me she loved me. Quite the contrary, she had often claimed there were boys she liked better than me, that I was a good enough friend she was always willing to play with, though too distracted, not involved enough in the game; finally, she had often given me apparent signs of coldness that might have shaken my belief that for her I was someone different from the others, if the source of that belief had been any love Gilberte might have felt for me, and not, as was the case, the love I felt for her, which rendered it far more resistant, since this made it depend entirely on the manner in which I was obliged, by an inner necessity, to think of Gilberte. But the feelings I had for her, I myself had not yet declared to her. Certainly, on every page of my notebooks I copied out her name and address endlessly, but at the sight of those indeterminate lines which I wrote without inducing her to think any more about me because of that, which made her take up so much apparent space around me without being any more involved in my life, I felt discouraged because they spoke to me not about Gilberte, who would not even see them, but about my own desire, which they seemed to show me as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and impotent. The most urgent thing was that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and that we should be able to make a reciprocal avowal of our love, which until then would not so to speak have begun. No doubt the various reasons that made me so impatient to see her would have been less imperious for a grown man. When we are older, more skilled in the cultivation of our pleasures, we are sometimes content with the enjoyment of thinking about a woman as I thought about Gilberte, without worrying about whether that image corresponds to the reality, and also with the pleasure of loving her without needing to be certain that she loves us; or we forgo the pleasure of confessing our warm feelings for her, in order to encourage the hardiness of hers for us, imitating those Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one more beautiful flower, sacrifice several others. But at the period when I loved Gilberte, I still believed that Love really existed outside of us; that, allowing us at the very most to remove obstacles in our way, it offered its joys in an order which we were not free to alter; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of confession the simulation of indifference, I would not only have deprived myself of one of the joys of which I had dreamed most often but that I would have fabricated for myself in my own way a love that was artificial and without value, without any connection to the real one, whose mysterious and pre-existing paths I would have had to forgo following. But when I reached the Champs-Elysees and when, before anything else, I was going to be able to bring my love, in order to make it undergo the necessary rectifications, face to face with its cause, alive and independent of me as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom I had counted to refresh the images that my tired memory could no longer recapture, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had played yesterday, and whom I had just been moved to greet and recognize by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets one of our feet in front of the other before we have had time to think, immediately it was as if she and the little girl who was the object of my dreams had been two different creatures. For example if, since the day before, I had been carrying in my memory two blazing eyes in full and shining cheeks, Gilberte's face now presented me insistently with something that quite specifically I had not recalled, a certain sharp tapering of the nose, which, instantaneously associating itself with certain other features, assumed the importance of those characteristics which in natural history define a whole species, and transmuted her into a little girl of the type that have pointed snouts. While I was preparing to take advantage of this longed-for moment in order to devote myself to submitting the image of Gilberte that I had prepared before coming, and that I could no longer find again in my mind, to an amendment that would allow me, in the long hours when I was alone, to be sure it was truly she whom I was recalling, that it was truly my love for her that I was augmenting little by little like a book as it is being written, she would pass me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body makes allowances for the external world in the reality of which his intellect does not believe, the same I who had made me greet her before I identified her, hastened to make me take the ball she was holding out to me (as if she were a friend with whom I had come here to play, and not a sister soul with whom I had come to be united), made me exchange with her, for the sake of decorum, until the hour when she went off, a thousand friendly and meaningless remarks and thus kept me both from preserving a silence during which I could at last have laid hands once more on the urgent truant image and from uttering the words that might have brought about the decisive progress in our love, the hope of which I was obliged each time to postpone until the following afternoon. It did, however, make some progress. One day when we had gone off with Gilberte to the booth of the vendor who was particularly nice to us for it was to her that M. Swann sent for his spice cake,19 and for health reasons, he consumed a great deal of it, suffering from ethnic eczema and the Prophets' constipation Gilberte showed me with a smile two little boys who were like the little artist and the little naturalist in children's story-books. For one of them did not want a stick of red barley sugar because he preferred violet and the other, tears in his eyes, was refusing the",3.5313160193762383,1.298007705897168,0.43052280518069763,0.06717453626525441,4.177348066298342,4.0,2.2907538471520934,62.41379310344828,46.0,59.81841328864371,1.2712707182320442,1.0,0.6217983530896565,1810,613,0.33867403314917127,7777,29,64.18114157033858,7.473355234143964e+27,3.7088611583841016e+24,0.8059801161289215,0.805566727977108,35.93549723756908,23.752373785482956,14.20449402272536,27.37435702038484,29.452205943989334,8.288552486187843,78.65688702610021,10.137931034482758,True,1209.0,0.9022332506203474,3.8595533498759305,2015.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008353346559465387,0.004176673279732693,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007831262399498799,0.0062650099195990395,0.005638508927639135,0.0009925558312655087,93,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"statue stands above the pool, when, from the path, addressing a little girl with red hair playing with a shuttlecock in front of the basin, another girl, while putting on her cloak and stowing her racket, shouted to her, in a sharp voice: 'Good-bye, Gilberte, I'm going home, don't forget we're coming to your house tonight after dinner.' That name, Gilberte, passed by close to me, evoking all the more forcefully the existence of the girl it designated in that it did not merely name her as an absent person to whom one is referring, but hailed her directly; thus it passed close by me, in action so to speak, with a power that increased with the curve of its trajectory and the approach of its goal; transporting along with it, I felt, the knowledge, the notions about the girl to whom it was addressed, that belonged not to me, but to the friend who was calling her, everything that, as she uttered it, she could see again or at least held in her memory, of their daily companionship, of the visits they paid to each other, and all that unknown experience which was even more inaccessible and painful to me because conversely it was so familiar and so tractable to that happy girl who grazed me with it without my being able to penetrate it and hurled it up in the air in a shout; letting float in the air the delicious emanation it had already, by touching them precisely, released from several invisible points in the life of Mlle Swann, from the evening to come, such as it might be, after dinner, at her house; forming, in its celestial passage among the children and maids, a little cloud of precious colour, like that which, curling over a lovely garden by Poussin,15 reflects minutely like a cloud in an opera, full of horses and chariots, some manifestation of the life of the gods; casting finally, on that bald grass, at the spot where it was at once a patch of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the blonde shuttlecock player (who did not stop launching the shuttlecock and catching it again until a governess wearing a blue ostrich feather called her), a marvellous little band the colour of heliotrope as impalpable as a reflection and laid down like a carpet over which I did not tire of walking back and forth with lingering, nostalgic and desecrating steps, while Francoise cried out to me: 'Come on now, button up your coat and let's make ourselves scarce', and I noticed for the first time with irritation that she had a vulgar way of speaking, and alas, no blue feather in her hat. But would she come back to the Champs-Elysees? The next day she was not there; but I saw her there on the following days; I spent all my time circling around the spot where she played with her friends, so that once when they found they were short of players for their game of prisoners' base, she sent to ask if I wanted to make up the number on their side, and after that I played with her each time she was there. But this was not every day; there were days when she was kept from coming by her lessons, by the catechism, a tea, that whole life separate from mine which twice, condensed in the name of Gilberte, I had felt pass so painfully close to me, on the steep path at Combray and on the lawn at the Champs-Elysees. On those days, she would announce in advance that we would not be seeing her; if it was because of her studies, she would say: 'It's an awful bore, I won't be able to come tomorrow; you'll all be having fun without me,' with a sorrowful air that consoled me a little; but on the other hand when she was invited to a party and I, not knowing, asked her if she would be coming out to play, she would answer: 'I should certainly hope not! I certainly hope Mama will let me go to my friend's.' At least on those days, I knew I would not see her, whereas other times, it was quite unexpectedly that her mother would take her shopping, and the next day she would say: 'Oh yes! I went out with Mama,' as though it were a natural thing and not, for someone else, the greatest possible misfortune. There were also the days of bad weather when her governess, who herself could not endure the rain, did not want to take her to the Champs-Elysees. And so if the sky was dubious, starting first thing in the morning I would question it constantly, taking into account every omen. If I saw the lady opposite, near the window, putting on her hat, I would say to myself: 'That lady is going to go out; so it's the sort of weather one can go out in: why wouldn't Gilberte do the same as that lady?' But the weather would darken, my mother would say it could lift again, that a ray of sunlight would be enough, but that more probably it would rain; and if it rained what was the good of going to the Champs-Elysees? And so from lunch on my anxious eyes never left the unsettled, cloudy sky. It remained dark. Before the window, the balcony was grey. Suddenly, on its gloomy stone I did not see a colour that was less dull, but I felt a sort of effort towards a colour less dull, the pulsation of a hesitant ray that would like to set free its light. A moment later, the balcony was as pale and reflective as a pool at dawn, and a thousand reflections of its ironwork lattice had alighted on it. A breath of wind dispersed them, the stone had darkened again, but, as though tamed, they returned; it began imperceptibly to whiten again and, in one of those continuous crescendoes like those which, in music, at the end of an overture, carry a single note to the highest fortissimo by making it pass rapidly through all the intermediary degrees, I saw it reach that fixed, unalterable gold of fine days, against which the cut-out shadow of the elaborate support of the balustrade stood out in black like a whimsical vegetation, with a delicacy in the delineation of its slightest details that seemed to betray a painstaking consciousness, an artistic satisfaction, and with such sharp relief, such velvet in the restfulness of its dark and happy masses that in truth those broad and leafy reflections resting on that lake of sun seemed to know they were pledges of calm and happiness. Instantaneous ivy, fleeting wall flora! the least colourful, the saddest, in the opinion of many, of those that clamber over the wall or decorate the casement; for me, the dearest of them all since the day it appeared on our balcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte, who was perhaps already in the Champs-Elysees and, as soon as I arrived there, would say to me: 'Let's start playing prisoners' base right away, you're on my side'; fragile, carried off by a breath, but also in harmony, not with the season, but with the hour; promise of an immediate happiness which the day will deny or fulfil, and thereby of the paramount immediate happiness, the happiness of love; softer, warmer on the stone even than moss; hardy, for it needs only a ray of light to come into being and blossom into joy, even in the heart of winter. And even on those days when all other vegetation has disappeared, when the handsome green leather that wraps the trunks of the old trees is hidden under snow, when the snow had stopped falling, but the weather was still too overcast to hope that Gilberte would go out, then suddenly, making my mother say: 'Well now, it's actually nice out, perhaps you might try going to the Champs-Elysees after all,' on the mantle of snow that covered the balcony the sun that had appeared would weave gold threads together and embroider black glimmers. That day we would find no one or one solitary girl about to leave, who would assure me that Gilberte was not coming. The chairs, deserted by the imposing but chilly assembly of governesses, were empty. Alone, near the lawn, sat a lady of a certain age who came in all weathers, always decked out in the same clothing, magnificent and dark, to make whose acquaintance I would at that time have sacrificed, had the exchange been allowed me, all the greatest future advantages of my life. For Gilberte went up to greet her every day; she asked Gilberte for news of 'her love of a mother'; and it seemed to me that, had I known her, I would have been someone quite different for Gilberte, someone who knew her parents' friends. While her grandchildren played farther off, she always read Les Debats,16 which she called 'my old Debats', and with an aristocratic affectation would say, when speaking of the policeman or the woman who rented the chairs:17 'My old friend the policeman', 'the chair-warden and I who are old friends'. Francoise was too cold to sit still; we walked to the pont de la Concorde to see the frozen Seine, which everyone including the children approached without fear as though it were a beached whale, immense, defenceless and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysees; I was growing sick with misery between the motionless merry-go-round and the white lawn, which was caught in the black web of paths from which the snow had been cleared and which was surmounted by the statue holding in its hand an added jet of ice which seemed to explain its gesture. Even the old lady, after folding her Debats, asked a passing nanny what time it was and thanked her by saying: 'How kind of you!' then begged the man tending the paths to tell her grandchildren to come back, because she was cold, adding: 'You are infinitely good. I am overwhelmed!' Suddenly the air was torn apart: between the puppet theatre and the circus, on the clearing horizon, against the opening sky, I had just spied, as though it were a fabulous sign, Mademoiselle's blue feather. And already Gilberte was running as fast as possible in my direction, sparkling and red under a square fur hat, animated by the cold, the lateness and her desire to play; a little before reaching me, she let herself slide along the ice and, either to help keep her balance, or because she thought it more graceful, or pretending to move like a",3.7809437682093794,1.8084595090114706,0.4181868004042553,0.05185960171961405,4.297297297297297,4.0,2.313389019852511,51.8,35.0,68.74541023640363,1.2608935466078324,1.0,0.5930268410683625,1813,674,0.37175951461665746,8106,35,67.07417192324291,1.3487850528837245e+29,6.398411066810837e+25,0.7451130725881633,0.7379080967018099,47.5864059569774,19.490543849972422,12.491233731153383,22.793910645339217,24.710270270270264,8.896679536679535,69.6157749586321,9.228571428571428,True,1108.0,0.8666982922201139,3.8453510436432636,2108.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02301635372501514,0.0077730668281849385,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007874015748031496,0.0077730668281849385,0.012719563900666263,0.003320683111954459,92,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"plum his nanny wanted to buy for him because, he finally said with passion: 'I like the other plum better, because it has a worm!' I bought two one-sou marbles. I gazed with admiration at the agates, luminous and captive in their separate wooden bowl, precious in my eyes because they were as blonde and beaming as young girls and because they cost fifty centimes apiece. Gilberte, who was given a great deal more money than I was, asked me which I thought was the most beautiful. They had the molten transparency of life itself. I did not want to make her sacrifice a single one of them. I would have liked her to be able to buy them, liberate them, all. Yet I pointed to one which was the same colour as her eyes. Gilberte took it, looked for its golden ray of light, stroked it, paid its ransom, but immediately handed her captive over to me saying: 'Here, it's for you, I'm giving it to you, keep it as a souvenir.' Another time, still preoccupied by the desire to hear La Berma in a classical play, I had asked her if she happened to own a little book in which Bergotte talked about Racine, and which one could no longer find. She had asked me to remind her of its exact title and that evening I had addressed an express letter to her, writing on the envelope that name, Gilberte Swann, which I had so often copied out in my notebooks. The next day she brought me a packet tied up in mauve ribbons and sealed with white wax, containing the little book, a copy of which she had asked someone to locate for her. 'You see? It really is the one you asked for,' she said, taking from her muff the letter I had sent her. But on the address of this pneumatique20 which, only yesterday, was nothing, was merely a petit bleu which I had written, and which, now that a telegraph boy had delivered it to Gilberte's concierge and a servant had carried it to her room, had become this priceless thing, one of the petits bleus she had received that day it was hard for me to recognize the insignificant, solitary lines of my handwriting under the printed circles apposed to it by the post office, under the inscriptions added in pencil by one of the telegraph messengers, signs of actual realization, stamps from the outside world, violet bands symbolizing life, which for the first time came to espouse, sustain, uplift, delight my dream. And there was also one day when she said to me: 'You know, you can call me Gilberte, anyway I'll call you by your first name. It's too tiresome otherwise.' Yet for a while she went on simply calling me vous21 and when I pointed this out to her, she smiled, and composing, constructing a sentence like the ones in grammar books of foreign languages whose only object is to make us use a new word, she ended it with my given name. And remembering later what I had felt then, I could distinguish within it the impression of having been held for a moment in her mouth, myself, naked, without any of the social terms and conditions that also belonged, either to her other friends, or, when she said my family name, to my parents, and of which her lips in the effort she made, rather like her father, to articulate the words she wanted to emphasize seemed to strip me, undress me, as one removes the skin from a fruit of which only the pulp can be eaten, while her gaze, adopting the same new degree of intimacy as her words, reached me more directly also, while at the same time showing its awareness of this, its pleasure and even its gratitude, by accompanying itself with a smile. But in the moment itself, I could not appreciate the value of these new pleasures. They were not given by the little girl I loved, to the me who loved her, but by the other, the one I played with, to that other me who possessed neither the memory of the true Gilberte, nor the inalienable heart which alone could have known the price of such a happiness, because it alone had desired it. Even after returning home I did not savour them, for, each day, the need which made me hope that the next day I would be able to enjoy a clear, calm, happy contemplation of Gilberte, that she would at last confess her love for me, explaining why she had had to hide it from me until now, that same need forced me to regard the past as nothing, to look ahead of me only, to consider the small attentions she had shown me not in themselves and as if they were enough, but as new rungs on which to set my foot, new rungs which would permit me to take another step up and at last attain the happiness I had not yet found. If she gave me these signs of friendliness from time to time, she also hurt me by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this often happened on the very days I had most counted on for the realization of my hopes. I was sure that Gilberte would come to the Champs-Elysees and I felt an elation that seemed to me only the vague anticipation of a great happiness when entering the drawing-room first thing in the morning to kiss Mama, who was already dressed to go out, the tower of her black hair fully constructed, and her lovely plump white hands still smelling of soap I learned, seeing a column of dust standing by itself above the piano and hearing a barrel organ playing En revenant de la revue22 under the window, that until nightfall winter would be receiving the unexpected and radiant visit of a day of spring. While we were eating lunch, the lady opposite, by opening her casement, had sent flying in the blink of an eye, from next to my chair streaking the entire width of our dining-room in a single bound a beam of light that had settled there for its afternoon rest and returned to continue it a moment later. At school, during the one o'clock class,23 the sun made me languish with impatience and boredom by trailing a glimmer of gold over my desk, like an invitation to a party I would not be able to attend before three o'clock, the hour when Francoise came to pick me up at the school-gate and we made our way towards the Champs-Elysees through streets decorated with light, choked with crowds, where the balconies, unsealed by the sun, and vaporous, floated before the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the Champs-Elysees I did not see Gilberte, she had not arrived yet. Motionless on the lawn fed by the invisible sun which here and there ignited the tip of a stalk of grass, while the pigeons that had landed on it looked like ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick had brought back up to the surface of the venerable soil, I stood with my eyes fixed on the horizon, expecting at any moment to see the image of Gilberte following her governess appear behind the statue, which seemed to hold out the child it was carrying, streaming with rays of light, to the benediction of the sun. The old reader of Les Debats was sitting in her seat, still in the same spot, she hailed a park-keeper, to whom she made a friendly gesture with her hand, calling out to him: 'What fine weather!' And when the chair-attendant approached to collect the price of the seat, she smirked and simpered as she put the ten-centime ticket away in the opening of her glove, as if it were a bouquet for which she was seeking, out of kindness towards the giver, the most flattering place possible. When she had found it, she performed a circular motion with her neck, straightened her boa, and fastened upon the attendant, showing her the bit of yellow paper sticking out over her wrist, the beautiful smile with which a woman, showing her bodice to a young man, says to him: 'Recognize your roses?' I led Francoise out as far as the Arc-de-Triomphe hoping to meet Gilberte, we did not meet her, and I was returning to the lawn convinced, now, that she would not be coming, when, in front of the merry-go-round, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself at me: 'Quick, quick, Gilberte's already been here for a quarter of an hour. She's going soon. We were waiting for you to make up a game of prisoners' base. ' While I was going up the avenue des Champs-Elysees, Gilberte had come by way of the rue Boissyd'Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage of the fine weather to do some shopping for her; and M. Swann was coming to pick up his daughter. So it was my fault; I should not have left the lawn; for one never knew for certain which way Gilberte would come, if it would be later or earlier, and in the end this waiting caused me to be more deeply moved, not only by the whole of the Champs-Elysees and the entire extent of the afternoon, a sort of immense expanse of space and time at each point and at each moment of which it was possible that Gilberte's image would appear, but even by that image itself, because behind that image I felt that there lay concealed the reason why it had been fired into my heart at four o'clock instead of two-thirty, topped by a hat for paying calls rather than a beret for playing, in front of the 'Ambassadeurs'24 and not between the two puppet theatres, I could divine one of those occupations in which I could not follow Gilberte and which forced her to go out or stay at home, I was in touch with the mystery of her unknown life. It was this mystery, too, that disturbed me when, running on orders from the little girl with the sharp voice to begin our game of prisoners' base right away, I saw Gilberte, so brusque and lively with us, curtseying to the lady with Les Debats (who was saying to her: 'What lovely sunlight, it's like fire'), talking to her with a shy smile, with a formal air which called to my mind the different young girl that Gilberte must be at home with her parents, with the friends of her parents, when paying calls, in the whole of her other existence which eluded me. But of that existence no one",3.5030227477284677,1.4258855424564845,0.42635428840681017,0.06921274843615106,4.182119205298013,4.0,2.1969651782902977,46.46153846153846,38.0,42.536166303358634,1.2566225165562914,1.0,0.5829013836569302,1812,678,0.3741721854304636,7894,39,66.9196048737807,1.1556202085507652e+29,5.57731760883574e+25,0.7659484430363304,0.7563535151248043,53.36627356087624,17.35814569536424,11.807384569943707,20.571370351502804,21.498550687722876,8.153774834437083,61.858889454915946,7.153846153846154,True,1117.0,0.8817567567567568,3.80984555984556,2072.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020218691974417165,0.007427274602847122,0.007427274602847122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008046214153084381,0.007220961419434702,0.007427274602847122,0.005791505791505791,94,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"gave me so strong an impression as did M. Swann, who came a little later to find his daughter. For he and Mme Swann because their daughter lived in their home, because her studies, her games, her friendships depended on them contained for me, like Gilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as was proper for gods all-powerful with respect to her, in whom it must have had its source, an inaccessible strangeness, a painful charm. Everything that concerned them was the object of a preoccupation so constant on my part that on the days when, as on these, M. Swann (whom I had seen so often in the past without his having aroused my curiosity, when he was on friendly terms with my parents) came to pick Gilberte up in the Champs-Elysees, once the pounding of my heart that had been excited by the appearance of his grey hat and travelling cape had subsided, his appearance still impressed me like that of a historical character about whom we have just been reading a series of books and whose least peculiarities impassion us. His relations with the Comte de Paris, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray, had left me indifferent, now assumed for me something wonderful, as if no one else had ever known the Orleans; they made him stand out vividly against the vulgar background of people of different classes out for a walk who were crowding that alley of the Champs-Elysees, and among whom I admired the fact that he consented to appear without demanding of them any special consideration, which none of them dreamed of giving him anyway, so profound was the incognito in which he was wrapped. He responded politely to the greetings of Gilberte's friends, even to mine although he had quarrelled with my family, but without appearing to know me. (This reminded me that he had, however, seen me quite often in the country; a memory that I had retained, but somewhere in the shadows, because ever since I had seen Gilberte again, for me Swann was pre-eminently her father, and no longer Swann of Combray; since the ideas with which I now linked his name were different from the ideas which had once formed the network in which it was included and which I no longer ever used when I wanted to think about him, he had become a new person; I did attach him, however, by an artificial, secondary and transversal line to our guest of earlier times; and since nothing had any value for me any more except to the extent that my love could profit from it, it was with a burst of shame and regret at not being able to erase them that I returned to the years when, in the eyes of this same Swann who was at this moment before me in the Champs-Elysees and to whom, happily, Gilberte had perhaps not mentioned my name, I had so often in the evenings made myself ridiculous by sending word asking Mama to come up to my room and say goodnight to me, while she was having coffee with him, my father and my grandparents at the table in the garden.) He told Gilberte he would let her play one game, that he could wait a quarter of an hour, and sitting down like anyone else on an iron chair, paid for his ticket with the same hand which Philippe VII25 had so often held in his own, while we began playing on the lawn, putting to flight the pigeons whose beautiful heart-shaped iridescent bodies, like the lilacs of the bird kingdom, went to seek refuge as though in so many sanctuaries, one on the large stone vase to which its beak, by disappearing into it, imparted the gesture, and assigned the purpose, of offering in abundance the fruits or seeds which the bird seemed to be pecking from it, another on the forehead of the statue, which it seemed to crown with one of those enamelled objects whose polychrome varies the monotony of the stone in certain ancient works of art, and with an attribute which, when the goddess carries it, earns her a particular epithet, and makes her, as does for a mortal woman a different first name, a new divinity. On one of those sunny days that had not fulfilled my hopes, I did not have the courage to hide my disappointment from Gilberte. I had so many things to ask you, I said to her. I thought that today was going to mean so much in our friendship. And as soon as you get here, you have to leave again! Try to come early tomorrow, so that I can finally talk to you. Her face shone and she was jumping with joy as she answered me: Tomorrow, you may depend upon it, my fine friend, I won't be coming at all! I've got a big tea-party; nor the day after tomorrow, either, I'm going to a friend's house to watch the arrival of King Theodosius26 from her windows, it will be splendid, and then the day after we're going to Michel Strogoff27 and then after that, Christmas will be coming soon and the New Year's holidays. Maybe they'll take me to the Midi.28 How nice that would be! though it will mean I won't have a Christmas tree; anyway, if I stay in Paris, I won't be coming here because I'll be paying calls with Mama. Good-bye, there's Papa calling me. I returned home with Francoise through streets that were still bedecked with sunlight, as on the evening of a holiday that is over. I could scarcely drag my legs along. I'm not a bit surprised, said Francoise. It's not the weather for this time of year, it's far too hot. Alas! My Lord, imagine all the other poor people out there who must be feeling sick today. Anyone would think things were topsy-turvy up in heaven, too! I repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which Gilberte had exploded with joy at the prospect of not coming back to the Champs-Elysees for such a long time. But already the charm with which, by the mere act of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as I thought about her, and the special, unique position painful though it was in which I was inevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the internal constraint of a mental habit had begun to add, even to this sign of indifference, something romantic, and in the midst of my tears a smile formed that was simply the timid adumbration of a kiss. And when it was time for the post to come, I said to myself that evening as on every evening: 'I'm going to get a letter from Gilberte, she's going to tell me at last that she has always loved me, and explain the mysterious reason why she has been forced to hide it from me until now, to pretend she could be happy without seeing me, the reason why she has disguised herself as the other Gilberte who is merely a playmate. Every evening I liked to imagine this letter, I believed I was reading it, I recited each sentence of it to myself. All of a sudden I stopped in alarm. I realized that if I were to receive a letter from Gilberte, it could not be that one anyway since I was the one who had just written it. And from then on, I forced myself to turn my thoughts away from the words I would have liked her to write to me, for fear that by articulating them, I would exclude precisely those the dearest, the most desired from the field of all possible compositions. Even if through an improbable coincidence it had been precisely the letter that I had invented that Gilberte on her own account addressed to me, recognizing my work in it I would not have had the impression of receiving something that did not come from me, something real, new, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my will, truly given by love. Meanwhile I reread a page which had not been written to me by Gilberte, but which at least came to me from her, that page by Bergotte on the beauty of the old myths that inspired Racine, and which, next to the agate marble, I kept near me always. I was moved by the goodness of my friend who had had someone find it for me; and because everyone needs to discover reasons for his passion, so much so that he is happy to recognize in the person he loves qualities which literature or conversation have taught him are among those worthy of inspiring love, so much so that he assimilates them by imitation and makes them new reasons for his love, even if these qualities were the most diametrically opposed to those his love would have sought so long as it remained spontaneous as Swann had done once upon a time, with the aesthetic nature of Odette's beauty I, who had at first loved Gilberte, back in Combray, because of all that was unknown about her life, into which I would have liked to hurl myself, become incarnated, abandoning my own life which was no longer anything to me, I now thought, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this life of mine, too well known, disdained, Gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the companionable and comfortable collaborator who in the evening, helping me in my work, would compare and collate my pamphlets. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise and almost divine old man because of whom I had first loved Gilberte, even before I saw her, now it was above all because of Gilberte that I loved him. With as much pleasure as the pages he had written on Racine, I looked at the paper closed with great seals of white wax and tied with a cascade of mauve ribbons in which she had brought them to me. I kissed the agate marble which was the best part of my friend's heart, the part that was not frivolous, but faithful, and which even though adorned with the mysterious charm of Gilberte's life remained close to me, lived in my bedroom, slept in my bed. But as for the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages by Bergotte, which I was so pleased to associate with the idea of my love for Gilberte, as if in the moments when that love appeared to me to be nothing at all they gave it a sort of substance, I saw that they were anterior to that love, that they did not resemble it, that their elements had been",3.5587934613871055,1.4681564598398686,0.44071107081394767,0.07183194736043765,4.229155162893429,4.0,2.327885431862119,47.6578947368421,28.0,52.91814747711763,1.2694643843180564,1.0,0.616585322738784,1811,642,0.3545002760905577,7916,38,65.35173340064485,2.4093350505855437e+28,1.1804679326729758e+25,0.8005832888790079,0.7810766274730364,51.06554992879772,17.97625868232149,11.673126768512176,20.940573687116743,22.318268185649103,8.446339039204858,65.21725420674824,8.368421052631579,True,1180.0,0.897109260166585,3.8784909358157766,2041.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01914368052696583,0.008027995059695347,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004631535611362701,0.003087690407575134,0.007410456978180321,0.005879470847623714,95,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"I asked. Why, naturally, answered my mother, who always seemed to be afraid that, were she to admit there was any coldness between them and Swann, people would have tried to bring about a reconciliation closer than she wished, because of Mme Swann, whom she did not want to know. It was he who came up and spoke to me, I didn't see him. So, then, you haven't quarrelled? Quarrelled? Now what makes you think we might have quarrelled? she answered briskly, as if I had attacked the fiction of her good relations with Swann and tried to effect a 'rapprochement'. He might be cross with you for not inviting him any more. One isn't obliged to invite everyone; does he invite me? I don't know his wife. But at Combray he used to come. Well, yes! He came at Combray, and now in Paris he has other things to do and so have I. But I promise you we didn't look in the least like two people who had quarrelled. We stood there together for a moment because they hadn't brought him his parcel. He asked after you, he told me you played with his daughter, added my mother, stunning me with the prodigious fact that I existed in Swann's mind, even more, that I existed there in so complete a manner, that, when I trembled with love there before him in the Champs-Elysees, he knew my name, who my mother was, and could amalgamate around my qualification as playmate of his daughter certain facts about my grandparents, their family, the place where we lived, certain details of our past life which were perhaps unknown even to me. But my mother did not seem to have seen any particular charm in that counter at Trois Quartiers where she had represented for Swann, at the moment when he caught sight of her, a definite person with whom he had memories in common that had inspired the impulse to approach her, the gesture of greeting her. Nor did she or my father either seem to find, in talking about Swann's grandparents, about the title of honorary stockbroker, a pleasure that surpassed all others. My imagination had singled out and sanctified one particular family within the social Paris, just as it had singled out from the Paris of stone one particular house whose carriage entrance it had sculpted and whose windows it had made precious. But I was the only one who could see these ornaments. In the same way that my father and mother regarded the house that Swann lived in as similar to the other houses built at the same time in the neighbourhood of the Bois, so Swann's family seemed to them of the same sort as many other families of stockbrokers. They judged it more favourably or less depending on the degree to which it shared in merits common to the rest of the universe and did not see in it anything unique. On the contrary, what they appreciated in it they encountered to an equal, or higher, degree elsewhere. And so, after having agreed that the house was well situated, they would talk about another that was better situated, but that had nothing to do with Gilberte, or about financiers a cut above her grandfather; and if they had seemed for a moment to be of the same opinion as me, it was because of a misunderstanding that would soon be dispelled. For, in order to perceive in everything that surrounded Gilberte an unknown quality analogous in the world of emotions to what infra-red may be in the world of colours, my parents would have needed that supplementary and ephemeral sense with which love had endowed me. On the days when Gilberte had let me know she would not be coming to the Champs-Elysees, I would try to go for a walk that brought me a little closer to her. Sometimes I would lead Francoise on a pilgrimage before the house where the Swanns lived. I would make her repeat endlessly what, through the governess, she had learned relating to Mme Swann. 'It seems she's a great believer in her medals. She'll never go off on a trip if she's heard an owl hooting, or something ticking inside the wall like a clock, or if she sees a cat at midnight, or if the wood furniture creaks. Oh, yes! She's a very religious person!' I was so in love with Gilberte that if, along the way, I saw their old butler walking a dog, my emotion would force me to stop, I would stare at his white whiskers with eyes full of passion. Francoise would say to me: What's wrong with you? Then, we would continue on our way until we reached their carriage entrance, where a concierge different from any other concierge, and steeped even to the braid of his livery in the same painful charm I had felt in the name Gilberte, seemed to know that I was one of those people whom a primordial unworthiness would prohibit for ever from penetrating into the mysterious life that he was charged with guarding and on which the windows of the entresol seemed conscious of being closed, resembling far less, between the stately fall of their muslin curtains, any other windows, than they did Gilberte's own eyes. At other times, we would go down the boulevards and I would take up a position at the corner of the rue Duphot; I had been told that here one could often see Swann going past on his way to the dentist; and my imagination so differentiated Gilberte's father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of the real world introduced into it such magic, that, even before I reached the Madeleine, I was moved at the thought of approaching a street where I might suddenly encounter that supernatural apparition. But most often when I was not going to see Gilberte since I had learned that Mme Swann went for a walk almost every day in the allee des Acacias, around the Grand Lac, and in the allee de la Reine-Marguerite30 I would steer Francoise in the direction of the Bois de Boulogne. For me it was like those zoological gardens in which one sees diverse flora and contrasting landscapes brought together in one place; where, after a hill, one finds a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a ditch, a hill, a marsh, but knows they are there only to provide the hippopotamus, zebras, crocodiles, albino rabbits, bears and heron with an appropriate environment or a picturesque setting in which to frolic about; the Bois too, equally complex, bringing together as it does diverse enclosed little worlds first a farm planted with red trees, American oaks, like an agricultural estate in Virginia, then a stand of firs at the edge of the lake, or a forest from which would rise suddenly in her supple fur, with the lovely eyes of an animal, some woman walking quickly it was the Garden of Woman; and like the Alley of the Myrtles in The Aeneid31 planted for their sake with trees of a single species, the allee des Acacias was a favourite spot of the most famous Beauties. Just as, from a long way off, the top of the rock from which it will dive into the water thrills the children who know they are about to see the sea lion, so, well before reaching the allee des Acacias, first their fragrance, which, radiating all around, allowed one to sense from a distance the approach and the singularity of a powerful, soft, vegetative entity, then, when I drew near, the glimpsed crest of their greenery, light and childishly graceful, with its easy elegance, its coquettish cut, its thin material, on which hundreds of flowers had swooped down like vibratile winged colonies of precious parasites, and, finally, even their name, feminine, indolent and sweet all of this made my heart pound, but with a worldly desire, like those waltzes which remind us only of the names of the beautiful guests whom the usher announces as they enter the ball-room. I had been told that in the alley I would see certain fashionable women who, even though they were not all married, were habitually mentioned along with Mme Swann, but most often by their professional names; their new names, when they had any, were only a sort of incognito which those who wanted to talk about them took care to remove in order to make themselves understood. Thinking that Beauty in the order of feminine refinements was governed by occult laws into the knowledge of which these women had been initiated, and that they had the power to make it real, I accepted in advance as a revelation the vision of their clothes, their carriages and horses, a thousand details deep within which I placed my belief as though it were an inner soul which would give the cohesiveness of a masterpiece to that ephemeral and shifting tableau. But it was Mme Swann whom I wanted to see, and I waited for her to pass, as moved as if she had been Gilberte, whose parents, steeped like all that surrounded her in her charm, excited in me as much love as she did, indeed a disturbance that was even more painful (because their point of contact with her was that domestic part of her life which was forbidden to me), and lastly (because I soon knew, as will be seen, that they did not like my playing with her) that feeling of veneration which we always have for those who wield unrestrained power to do us harm. I assigned the first place to simplicity, in the order of aesthetic merit and social grandeur, when I saw Mme Swann on foot, wearing a cloth polonaise, on her head a little toque trimmed with a pheasant wing, a bouquet of violets at her bodice, in a hurry, crossing the allee des Acacias as if it were merely the shortest way to return home and answering with a wink the gentlemen in carriages who, recognizing her figure from far away, bowed to her and said to themselves that no one was as smart. But in place of simplicity, it was ostentation that I put on the highest rank, if, after I had forced Francoise, who was exhausted and said her legs were 'folding up', to walk back and forth for an hour, at last I would see, coming out of the alley that leads from the Porte Dauphine the picture for me of royal glamour, of the arrival of a sovereign, an impression such as no real queen has been able to give me since then, because the notion I had of their power was",3.301872611523575,1.496691366403311,0.4300774884034481,0.08166665948641544,4.3510520487264674,4.0,2.401253940731355,41.04545454545455,24.5,41.175320579121035,1.3006644518272426,1.0,0.6587595320547422,1806,657,0.3637873754152824,8117,44,64.98798883804412,1.674653426323796e+28,8.201045182780587e+24,0.7722634319649186,0.7670702602536905,55.13765101177894,15.765567804288736,12.20270954787414,18.876653578979163,19.586182422228937,9.063034330011075,59.041024866606264,7.386363636363637,True,1133.0,0.8922624877571009,3.975024485798237,2042.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012302107492185136,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009680346879096502,0.0052435212261772715,0.008470303519209438,0.0068560235063663075,97,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"determined by talent or by the laws of mineralogy before Gilberte knew me, that nothing in the book or in the stone would have been different if Gilberte had not loved me and that consequently nothing entitled me to read in them a message of happiness. And while my love, ceaselessly waiting for the next day to bring an avowal of Gilberte's love, cancelled and undid each evening the badly done work of the day, in the darkness inside me an unknown seamstress did not leave the pulled threads in the scrap-heap but arranged them, with no concern for pleasing me or working for my happiness, in the different order to which she gave all her work. Showing no particular interest in my love, nor beginning by deciding that I was indeed loved, she gathered up those of Gilberte's actions which had seemed inexplicable to me along with her faults, which I had excused. Then the first and the second acquired a meaning. It seemed to say, this new order, that when I saw Gilberte, instead of coming to the Champs-Elysees, go to a party, go shopping with her governess, or prepare to be away over the New Year's holidays, I was wrong to think: 'It's because she's frivolous or docile.' For she would have ceased to be one or the other if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It said further, this new order, that I must after all know what it was to love since I loved Gilberte; it pointed out to me the perpetual concern I felt to show myself to advantage in her eyes, because of which I tried to persuade my mother to buy Francoise a raincoat and a hat with a blue ostrich feather, or better still not to continue sending me to the Champs-Elysees with that maid who made me blush (to which my mother answered that I was unfair to Francoise, that she was a good woman who was devoted to us), and also that unique need to see Gilberte because of which months in advance I thought only of trying to learn at what time of the year she would be leaving Paris and where she would be going, finding even the most pleasant countryside a place of exile if she was not going to be there, and wanting only to stay in Paris all the time as long as I could see her at the Champs-Elysees; and it had no difficulty showing me that I would not find that concern, or that need, behind Gilberte's actions. She on the contrary appreciated her governess, without worrying about what I thought of her. She found it natural not to come to the Champs-Elysees, if she was going to make some purchases with Mademoiselle, pleasant if she was going out with her mother. And even supposing she would have allowed me to spend the holidays in the same place as she, at least in choosing that place she considered her parents' desires, the thousand amusements she had heard about and not in the least that this was the place where my family was intending to send me. When she assured me from time to time that she liked me less than one of her other friends, less than she had liked me the day before because I had made her lose the game through my carelessness, I would ask her to forgive me, I would ask her what I should do so that she would begin to like me again as much as, so that she would like me more than the others; I wanted her to tell me that it was already done, I begged her for it as if she could change her affection for me as she wished, as I wished, in order to please me, merely by the words that she would say, depending on my good or my bad behaviour. Did I not know, then, that what I myself felt, for her, depended neither on her actions nor on my own will? It showed me, finally, the new order designed by the invisible seamstress, that if we may wish that the actions of a person who has hurt us until now were not sincere, there follows in their wake a clarity against which our wishes are powerless and to which, rather than to them, we must address ourselves in asking what that person's actions will be tomorrow. These new words were heard by my love; they persuaded it that the next day would not be different from what all the other days had been; that Gilberte's feeling for me, already too old to be able to change, was indifference; that in my friendship with Gilberte, I was the only one who loved. 'It's true, my love answered, there's nothing more to be done with this friendship, it won't change.' And so, the very next day (or waiting for a public holiday if there was one coming up soon, or an anniversary, or the New Year perhaps, one of those days which are not like the others, when time makes a fresh start by rejecting the heritage of the past, by not accepting the legacy of its sorrows) I would ask Gilberte to give up our old friendship and lay the foundations of a new one. I always had within reach of my hand a map of Paris which, because one could distinguish on it the street where M. and Mme Swann lived, seemed to me to contain a treasure. And for pleasure, from a sort of chivalrous loyalty also, apropos of anything or nothing, I would say the name of that street, until my father asked, not being fully informed about my love as were my mother and my grandmother: Now why do you talk about that street all the time, there's nothing extraordinary about it, it's a very pleasant street to live on because it's two steps from the Bois, but there are ten others of which the same thing is true. I contrived at every turn to make my parents say the name Swann; of course I repeated it to myself in my own mind incessantly; but I also needed to hear the delicious sound of it and to have someone else play me this music the silent reading of which was not enough. The name Swann, which I had known for such a long time, was for me also, now, as can happen with the most everyday words for certain aphasics, a new name. It was always present in my mind and yet my mind could not grow accustomed to it. I took it apart, I spelled it, its orthography was a surprise to me. And at the same time that it had ceased to be familiar, it had ceased to appear innocent. The joy I felt at hearing it I believed was so guilty that it seemed to me others guessed my thoughts and changed the conversation if I tried to lead it there. I resorted to subjects that still touched upon Gilberte, I recited the same words endlessly, and although I knew they were only words words spoken far away from her, which she could not hear, words without potency that repeated what was, but could not modify it yet it seemed to me that by dint of thus feeling, handling everything that touched Gilberte I would perhaps make something happy emerge from it. I told my parents again that Gilberte liked her governess very much, as if that proposition articulated for the hundredth time were at last going to have the effect of suddenly producing Gilberte, who had come to live with us for ever. I resumed my praise of the old lady who read Les Debats (I had hinted to my parents that she was an ambassadress or perhaps a royal highness) and I continued to celebrate her beauty, her magnificence, her nobility, until the day I said that from what I had heard Gilberte call her, her name must be Mme Blatin. Oh, now I know who she is! exclaimed my mother while I felt myself blushing from shame. On guard! On guard! as your poor grandfather would have said. So she's the one you find so beautiful! Why, she's horrible and always has been. She's the widow of a bailiff. You don't remember when you were little the lengths I went to to avoid her at the gymnastics class where, though she didn't know me, she would come and try to talk to me with the excuse of wanting to tell me you were ""too beautiful for a boy"". She always had a mania for getting to know people and she must indeed be rather mad as I always thought, if she really knows Mme Swann. For though her background is quite common, at least there was never anything said against her so far as I know. But she always had to cultivate a new acquaintance. She's horrible, frightfully vulgar, and a trouble-maker into the bargain. As for Swann, in order to try to resemble him, I would spend all my time at the table pulling on my nose and rubbing my eyes. My father would say: 'The child has no sense, he'll make himself quite hideous.' I would especially have liked to be as bald as Swann. He seemed to me a being so extraordinary that I found it amazing that people I knew actually knew him too and that the chance events of an ordinary day might bring one face to face with him. And one time, my mother, in the course of telling us, as she did every evening at dinner about the errands she had run that afternoon, merely by saying: 'Speaking of which, guess who I met in Trois Quartiers29 at the umbrella counter: Swann,' caused the centre of her story, so very dry for me, to blossom with a mysterious flower. What a melancholy pleasure, to learn that that very afternoon, his supernatural form profiled against the crowd, Swann had gone to buy an umbrella! Among the great and tiny events, equally uninteresting, this one awoke in me those peculiar vibrations by which my love for Gilberte was perpetually moved. My father said I was not interested in anything because I did not listen when they talked about the political consequences that might follow from the visit of King Theodosius, at this moment the guest of France and, it was claimed, its ally. But how keenly, on the other hand, I wanted to know if Swann was wearing his travelling cape! Did you say hello to each other?",3.37314961193387,1.197125994763622,0.4190525656510379,0.060208501779258614,4.138350857775318,4.0,2.2639119540455335,36.87755102040816,27.0,34.48669228880768,1.2418372993912563,1.0,0.5563524083757437,1807,569,0.3148865522966242,7732,49,63.8876672995103,5.57264490021985e+27,2.737055451974386e+24,0.8011531763477251,0.7560758043793921,64.34485018578545,13.44592503077601,10.336758426978903,16.47763911319924,16.50040805032583,7.730846707249583,52.92625052234507,5.918367346938775,True,1210.0,0.8978388998035364,3.7976424361493124,2036.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015002098195551825,0.009232060428031893,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003147293327738145,0.004616030214015947,0.007553503986571549,0.002455795677799607,96,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"less vague and more founded upon experience borne along by two flying fiery horses as slender and smoothly turned as in the drawings of Constantin Guys,32 carrying an enormous coachman settled on his seat and wrapped in furs like a Cossack, next to a little groom who recalled the 'tiger' of 'the late Baudenord'33 I saw or rather I felt imprint its form on my heart with a neat and exhausting wound a matchless victoria, in its design a little high and with allusions to the old forms showing through its 'dernier cri' opulence, in the depths of which Mme Swann lay back carelessly, her hair now blonde with a single grey lock and girded with a thin band of flowers, most often violets, from which descended long veils, in her hand a mauve parasol, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I saw only the beneficence of a monarch and in which there was, more than anything else, a cocotte's provocativeness, and which she inclined gently on the people who bowed to her. That smile in reality said to some of them: 'I remember it very well it was exquisite!'; to others: 'How I would have loved to! What bad luck!'; to others: 'Why yes, if you like! I'll stay in line for a moment longer and cut out as soon as I can.' When strangers passed, she would still allow an idle smile to linger around her lips, as though it were turned to the expectation or memory of a friend, which made people say: 'How beautiful she is!' And for certain men only she had a smile that was sour, stiff, reticent and cold, and meant: 'Yes, you beast, I know you have the tongue of a viper, that you can't keep from talking! But do I care about you? Do I?' Coquelin34 went past holding forth among a group of listening friends, and with his hand gave a broad theatrical hello to the people in the carriages. But I was thinking only about Mme Swann and I pretended I had not seen her yet, for I knew that once she drew level with the Tir aux Pigeons35 she would tell her coachman to cut out of the line and stop so that she could come back down the alley on foot. And on the days when I felt I had the courage to pass close to her, I would drag Francoise in that direction. At a certain moment, in fact, in the footpath, walking towards us, I would see Mme Swann letting the long train of her mauve dress spread out behind her, clothed, as the common people imagine queens, in fabrics and rich finery that other women did not wear, lowering her eyes now and then to the handle of her parasol, paying little attention to the people passing, as if her great business and her goal were to take some exercise, without thinking that she was being observed and that all heads were turned towards her. But now and then when she had looked back to call her greyhound, she would imperceptibly cast a circular gaze around her. Even those who did not know her were alerted by something singular and excessive or perhaps by a telepathic radiation like those that triggered bursts of applause from the ignorant crowd at moments when La Berma was sublime that this must be some well-known person. They would ask one another: 'Who is she?', or sometimes question a passing stranger, or promise themselves they would remember the way she was dressed as a reference for some better-informed friend who would immediately enlighten them. Others, half stopping in their walk, would say: Do you know who that is? Mme Swann! That means nothing to you? Odette de Crecy? Odette de Crecy? Why in fact I was just wondering... Those sad eyes... But you know she can't be as young as she once was! I remember I slept with her the day MacMahon resigned. You'd better not remind her of it. She's now Mme Swann, wife of a gentleman in the Jockey Club who's a friend of the Prince of Wales. But she's still superb. Yes, but if only you'd known her then how pretty she was! She lived in a very strange little house filled with Chinese bric-a-brac. I remember we were bothered by the newsboys shouting outside, in the end she made me get up. Though I could not hear these comments, I did perceive all around her the indistinct murmur of celebrity. My heart raced with impatience at the thought that yet another instant was going to pass before the moment when all these people, among whom I was disconsolate not to find a certain mulatto banker by whom I felt I was despised, would see the young stranger to whom they had paid no attention bow (without knowing her, in fact, but I felt I was authorized to do so because my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter's playmate) to that woman whose reputation for beauty, improper behaviour and elegance was universal. But I was already very close to Mme Swann, so I raised my hat to her with a motion so large, so extended, so prolonged, that she could not help smiling. People laughed. As for her, she had never seen me with Gilberte, she did not know my name, but for her I was like one of the keepers of the Bois, or the boatman or the ducks on the lake to which she threw bread one of those secondary, familiar, anonymous figures, as lacking in individual character as an 'extra' on stage, of her outings in the Bois. On certain days when I had not seen her in the allee des Acacias, I would sometimes find her in the allee de la Reine-Marguerite, where women go who want to be alone, or to appear to want to be alone; she would not remain alone for long, soon joined by some friend, often wearing a grey 'topper', whom I did not know and who would talk to her for a long time, while their two carriages followed. The complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which makes it an artificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word, a Garden, I rediscovered this year as I was crossing it to go to Trianon,36 on one of the first mornings of this month of November when, in Paris, inside the houses, we are so close to the autumn spectacle, and yet denied it, as it rapidly comes to an end without our witnessing it, that we are filled with a yearning, a veritable fever for the dead leaves that may go so far as to stop us from sleeping. In my closed room, they had been coming for a month now, summoned by my desire to see them, between my thoughts and any object to which I applied myself, and they eddied like those yellow spots that sometimes, whatever we may be looking at, dance in front of our eyes. And that morning, no longer hearing the rain fall as on the days before, seeing the fine weather smile at the corners of the drawn curtains as at the corners of a closed mouth that betrays the secret of its happiness, I had felt that I might be able to look at those yellow leaves as the light passed through them, in their supreme beauty; and being no more able to keep myself from going to see the trees than in earlier days, when the wind blew too hard in my chimney, from departing for the seaside, I had left to go to Trianon, by way of the Bois de Boulogne. It was the hour and it was the season when the Bois seems perhaps the most manifold, not only because it is more subdivided, but also because it is subdivided differently. Even in the open parts where one embraces a great space, here and there, in front of the dark distant masses of the trees that had no leaves or still had their summer leaves, a double row of orange chestnut trees seemed, as in a picture just begun, to be the only thing painted so far by the scene-painter, who had not put any colour on the rest, and it offered its alley in full light for the episodic walk of figures that would be added later. Farther off, at a place where the trees were still covered in all their green leaves, one alone, small, squat, lopped, obstinate, shook in the wind a homely head of red hair. Elsewhere, again, there was a first awakening of this May of the leaves, and those of an ampelopsis as marvellous and smiling as a pink winter hawthorn had since that same morning been all in flower. And the Bois had the temporary and artificial look of a tree nursery or a park, where for botanical purposes or in preparation for a festival, they have just placed, among the trees of a common sort that have not yet been transplanted, two or three precious species with fantastic foliage which seem to be reserving an empty space around themselves, giving air, creating light. Thus it was the season when the Bois de Boulogne reveals the most numerous different varieties and juxtaposes the most numerous distinct parts in a composite aggregation. And it was the hour, as well. In the places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to be undergoing a change in substance starting from the point where they were touched by the light of the sun, almost horizontal in the morning as it would be again a few hours later at the moment when in the early twilight it flames up like a lamp, projects over a distance on to the foliage a warm and artificial glow, and sets ablaze the topmost leaves of a tree that remains the dull and incombustible candelabrum of its burning tip. Here, it thickened the leaves of the chestnut trees like bricks and, like a piece of yellow Persian masonry patterned in blue, crudely cemented them against the sky, there on the contrary detached them from it as they clutched at it with their fingers of gold. Halfway up a tree clothed in Japanese ivy, it had grafted and brought into bloom, too dazzling to discern clearly, an immense bouquet as though of red flowers, perhaps a variety of carnation. The different parts of the Bois, merging more completely in summer in the thickness and monotony of their green, were now separated. Open spaces made visible the entrance to almost every one of them, or a sumptuous bit of foliage marked it like a banner.

"a coloured map, Armenonville, the Pre Catelan, Madrid, the Race Course, the shores of the lake. From time to time there would appear some useless construction, a fake grotto, a mill for which the trees parted to make room or which a lawn carried forwards on its soft platform. One sensed that the Bois was not merely a wood, that it fulfilled a purpose foreign to the life of its trees, the exhilaration I was experiencing was not caused merely by an admiration for autumn, but by some desire. The great source of a joy which the soul feels at first without recognizing its cause, without understanding that it is motivated by nothing outside. And so I looked at the trees with an unsatisfied tenderness that passed beyond them and went on without my knowing it towards that masterpiece of lovely strolling women which they enclose each day for several hours. I went towards the allee des Acacias. I passed through old groves where the morning light imposed new divisions, pruning the trees, joining together the different stems and composing bouquets. Deftly it drew towards itself a pair of trees; using the powerful scissors of a ray of light and a shadow, it cut off from each of them half its trunk and branches and, weaving together the two halves that remained, made of them either a single pillar of shadow, delimited by the sunshine around it, or a single phantom of brightness whose tremulous artificial contour was ringed by a net of black shadow. When a ray of sun gilded the highest branches, they seemed, steeped in a sparkling dampness, to emerge alone from the liquid emerald-coloured atmosphere in which the entire forest was plunged as though under the sea. For the trees continued to live their own life and, when they had no more leaves, that life shone more brightly on the sheath of green velvet that wrapped their trunks or in the white enamel of the spheres of mistletoe that spangled the tops of the poplars, as round as the sun and the moon in Michelangelo's Creation. But forced as they have been for so many years by a sort of grafting to live a life shared with women, they conjured up for me the wood nymph, the lovely quick and colourful lady of the world whom they cover with their branches as she passes beneath them, obliging her to feel as they do the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy time of my believing youth, when I would avidly come to the places where masterpieces of feminine elegance were created for a few moments among the unconscious and complicitous leaves. But the beauty which the pines and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me desire, trees more disturbing because of this than the chestnuts and lilacs of Trianon that I was going to see, was not fixed outside me in the mementoes of some historic period, in works of art, in a little temple to the god of Love whose base is piled with golden palmate leaves. I reached the shores of the lake, I went on as far as the Tir aux Pigeons. The idea of perfection which at that time I had carried inside me I had conferred upon the height of a victoria, upon the slenderness of those horses, as furious and light as wasps, their eyes bloodshot like the cruel steeds of Diomedes,37 which now, filled as I was with a desire to see again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had driven me down these same paths many years before, I wanted to see before my eyes again at the moment when Mme Swann's enormous coachman, watched over by a little groom as fat as a fist and as childlike as Saint George, tried to control those wings of steel as they thrashed about quivering with fear. Alas, now there were only automobiles driven by moustached mechanics with tall footmen by their sides. I wanted to hold in front of the eyes of my body, so as to know if they were as charming as they appeared in the eyes of my memory, women's little hats so low they seemed to be simple crowns. All the hats were now immense, covered with fruits and flowers and varieties of birds. In place of the lovely dresses in which Mme Swann looked like a queen, I now saw Greco-Saxon tunics with Tanagra38 folds, and sometimes in the style of the Directoire, made of liberty-silk chiffons sprinkled with flowers like wallpaper. On the heads of the gentlemen who could have walked with Mme Swann in the allee de la Reine-Marguerite, I did not find the grey hats of earlier times, nor any others. They went out bare-headed. And I no longer had any belief to infuse into all these new elements of the spectacle, to give them substance, unity, life; they went past scattered before me, randomly, without reality, containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have tried as they had in earlier times to form into a composition. These were ordinary women, in whose elegance I had no faith and whose dress seemed to me unimportant. But when a belief disappears, there survives it more and more vigorously so as to mask the absence of the power we have lost to give reality to new things a fetishistic attachment to the old things which our belief once animated, as if it were in them and not in us that the divine resided and as if our present lack of belief had a contingent cause, the death of the Gods. How awful! I said to myself: can anyone think these automobiles are as elegant as the old carriages and pairs? I'm probably too old already but I'm not meant for a world in which women hobble themselves in dresses that aren't even made of cloth. What's the use of walking among these trees, if nothing is left of what used to gather under the delicate reddening leaves, if vulgarity and idiocy have taken the place of the exquisite thing they once framed? How awful! My consolation is to think about the women I have known, now that there is no more elegance. But how could anyone contemplating these horrible creatures under their hats topped with a birdcage or a vegetable patch even sense what was so charming about the sight of Mme Swann in a simple mauve hood or a little hat with a single stiff, straight iris poking up from it? Could I even have made them understand the emotion I felt on winter mornings when I met Mme Swann on foot, in a sealskin coat, wearing a simple beret with two blades of partridge feathers sticking up from it, but enveloped also by the artificial warmth of her apartment, which was conjured by nothing more than the bouquet of violets crushed at her breast whose live blue flowering against the grey sky, the icy air, the bare-branched trees, had the same charming manner of accepting the season and the weather merely as a setting, and of living in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this woman, as had, in the vases and flower-stands of her drawing-room, close to the lit fire, before the silk sofa, the flowers that looked out through the closed window at the falling snow? But it would not have been enough for me anyway for the clothes to be the same as in those earlier times. Because of the dependence which the different parts of a recollection have on one another, parts which our memory keeps balanced in an aggregate from which we are not permitted to abstract anything, or reject anything, I would have wanted to be able to go and spend the last part of the day in the home of one of these women, over a cup of tea, in an apartment with walls painted in dark colours, as Mme Swann's still was (in the year after the one in which the first part of this story ends) and in which the orange flares, the red combustion, the pink and white flame of the chrysanthemums would gleam in the November twilight, during moments like those in which (as we will see later) I was not able to discover the pleasures I desired. But now, even though they had led to nothing, those moments seemed to me to have had enough charm in themselves. I wanted to find them again as I remembered them. Alas, there was no longer anything but Louis XVI apartments all white and dotted with blue hydrangeas. Moreover, people no longer returned to Paris until very late. Mme Swann would have answered me from a country house that she would not be back until February, well after the time of the chrysanthemums, had I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which I felt belonged to a distant year, to a vintage to which I was not allowed to go back, the elements of that desire which had itself become as inaccessible as the pleasure it had once vainly pursued. And I would also have needed them to be the same women, those whose clothing interested me because, at the time when I still believed, my imagination had individualized them and given them each a legend. Alas, in the avenue des Acacias the allee de Myrtes I did see a few of them again, old, now no more than terrible shadows of what they had been, wandering, desperately searching for who knows what in the Virgilian groves. They had fled long since as I still vainly questioned the deserted paths. The sun had hidden itself. Nature was resuming its rule over the Bois, from which the idea that it was the Elysian Garden of Woman had vanished; above the artificial mill the real sky was grey; the wind wrinkled the Grand Lac with little wavelets, like a real lake; large birds swiftly crossed the Bois, like a real wood, and uttering sharp cries alighted one after another in the tall oaks which under their druidical crowns and with a Dodonean39 majesty seemed to proclaim the inhuman emptiness of the disused forest, and helped me better understand what a contradiction it is to search in reality for memory's pictures, which would never have the charm that comes to them from memory itself and from not being perceived by the senses. The reality I had known no longer existed. That Mme Swann did not arrive exactly the same at the same moment was enough to make the avenue different. The places we have known do not belong solely to the world of space in which we situate them for our greater convenience. They were only a thin slice among contiguous impressions that formed our life at that time; the memory of a certain image is only regret for a certain moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fleeting, alas, as the years.",3.1039755015860333,1.131663595799835,0.45146356930812664,0.06886998917712832,4.368591473286562,4.0,2.32275075863698,37.816326530612244,23.0,34.78192908087841,1.266594711279007,1.0,0.6085832426299806,1853,694,0.3745277927684835,8295,49,64.6046122208484,1.1413703672376143e+28,5.586736990884064e+24,0.7532776673324406,0.7526813748669117,61.29751599722459,14.104184940031061,11.570972422632316,17.436298556119695,18.054229104485835,9.104587155963301,54.65388724297058,6.36734693877551,True,1101.0,0.911404796867352,4.060205580029368,2043.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004339678469277049,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011835486734391953,0.0035506460203175855,0.0,0.005873715124816446,99,book_proust_en_swans-way_davis_original_segments.csv_metrics
"For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say ""I'm going to sleep."" And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Francois I and Charles V. This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark indeed. I would ask myself what o'clock it could be; I could hear the whistling of trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the distance like the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night; and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home. I would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow, as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood. Or I would strike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. The hour when an invalid, who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a strange hotel, awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief a streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door. Oh, joy of joys! it is morning. The servants will be about in a minute: he can ring, and some one will come to look after him. The thought of being made comfortable gives him strength to endure his pain. He is certain he heard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light beneath his door is extinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help. I would fall asleep, and often I would be awake again for short snatches only, just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or to open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness, to savour, in an instantaneous flash of perception, the sleep which lay heavy upon the furniture, the room, the whole surroundings of which I formed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very soon return to share. Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever outgrown; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors, such as that old terror of my great-uncle's pulling my curls, which was effectually dispelled on the day--the dawn of a new era to me--on which they were finally cropped from my head. I had forgotten that event during my sleep; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my great-uncle's fingers; still, as a measure of precaution, I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams. Sometimes, too, just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam, so a woman would come into existence while I was sleeping, conceived from some strain in the position of my limbs. Formed by the appetite that I was on the point of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that gratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers, would strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company I had left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her kiss, my body bent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes happen, she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking hours, I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have always longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste in reality what has charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory of her would dissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my dream. When a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of the hours, the sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly host. Instinctively, when he awakes, he looks to these, and in an instant reads off his own position on the earth's surface and the amount of time that has elapsed during his slumbers; but this ordered procession is apt to grow confused, and to break its ranks. Suppose that, towards morning, after a night of insomnia, sleep descends upon him while he is reading, in quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to sleep, he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course, and, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the time, but will conclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair, say, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit, the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space, and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country. But for me it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep, and when I awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal's consciousness; I was more destitute of human qualities than the cave-dweller; but then the memory, not yet of the place in which I was, but of various other places where I had lived, and might now very possibly be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped by myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of civilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps, followed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by degrees the component parts of my ego. Perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon them by our conviction that they are themselves, and not anything else, and by the immobility of our conceptions of them. For it always happened that when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to discover where I was, everything would be moving round me through the darkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy with sleep to move, would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orientation of its various members, so as to induce from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together and to give a name to the house in which it must be living. Its memory, the composite memory of its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades offered it a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept; while the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves to the shape of each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the darkness. And even before my brain, lingering in consideration of when things had happened and of what they had looked like, had collected sufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room, it, my body, would recall from each room in succession what the bed was like, where the doors were, how daylight came in at the windows, whether there was a passage outside, what I had had in my mind when I went to sleep, and had found there when I awoke. The stiffened side underneath my body would, for instance, in trying to fix its position, imagine itself to be lying, face to the wall, in a big bed with a canopy; and at once I would say to myself, ""Why, I must have gone to sleep after all, and Mamma never came to say good night!"" for I was in the country with my grandfather, who died years ago; and my body, the side upon which I was lying, loyally preserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have forgotten, brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the night-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn and hung by chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Siena marble in my bedroom at Combray, in my great-aunt's house, in those far distant days which, at the moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly penned, but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly awake. Then would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid away in another direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup's house in the country; good heavens, it must be ten o'clock, they will have finished dinner! I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always take when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before dressing for the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the Combray days, when, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of pleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from visiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in the sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return",3.572368256478921,1.3956080834988132,0.45268599279980326,0.061147432837874424,4.182604272634792,4.0,2.3003654300926772,47.951219512195124,37.0,38.603646497488214,1.2538148524923702,1.0,0.6044706235994127,1966,682,0.34689725330620547,8511,41,73.88550019330025,1.2247995739282205e+32,5.4849958527909565e+28,0.8319396644830703,0.820285351612629,52.09177567426745,17.90599086916607,12.095408849813502,21.235421680768184,22.24567588020743,8.176419125127161,63.515817681065926,7.463414634146342,True,1240.0,0.8844603672189879,3.811464397671294,2233.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.026766083548417932,0.015677277506930504,0.009559315553006405,0.004588471465443074,0.0,0.0,0.010993212885957365,0.0031545741324921135,0.003728133065672498,0.0013434841021047917,0,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"exclaim, ""But, after all, he had a heart of gold."" For many years, albeit--and especially before his marriage--M. Swann the younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society which his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring--with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know it--one of the smartest members of the Jockey Club, a particular friend of the Comte de Paris and of the Prince of Wales, and one of the men most sought after in the aristocratic world of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage, could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M. Swann, the father, had been a stockbroker; and so 'young Swann' found himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as in a list of taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.' If he knew other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes all the more good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat, had he met them while he was walking with ourselves. Had there been such a thing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself, as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a very simple life, and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d'Orleans, a neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered. ""Are you really a connoisseur, now?"" she would say to him; ""I ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you by the dealers,"" for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical faculty, and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most minute details, but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him about art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his admiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure--and he would have a fresh story for us on every occasion--with some one whom we ourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman. These stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann invariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he shewed in telling us of them. ""It is easy to see that you are a regular 'character,' M. Swann!"" As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a trifle 'common,' she would always take care to remark to strangers, when Swann was mentioned, that he could easily, if he had wished to, have lived in the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l'Opera, and that he was the son of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million francs, but that it was a fad of his. A fad which, moreover, she thought was bound to amuse other people so much that in Paris, when M. Swann called on New Year's Day bringing her a little packet of _marrons glaces_, she never failed, if there were strangers in the room, to say to him: ""Well, M. Swann, and do you still live next door to the Bonded Vaults, so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to Lyons?"" and she would peep out of the corner of her eye, over her glasses, at the other visitors. But if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann, who, in his capacity as the son of old M. Swann, was 'fully qualified' to be received by any of the 'upper middle class,' the most respected barristers and solicitors of Paris (though he was perhaps a trifle inclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance), had another almost secret existence of a wholly different kind: that when he left our house in Paris, saying that he must go home to bed, he would no sooner have turned the corner than he would stop, retrace his steps, and be off to some drawing-room on whose like no stockbroker or associate of stockbrokers had ever set eyes--that would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as, to a woman of wider reading, the thought of being herself on terms of intimacy with Aristaeus, of knowing that he would, when he had finished his conversation with her, plunge deep into the realms of Thetis, into an empire veiled from mortal eyes, in which Virgil depicts him as being received with open arms; or--to be content with an image more likely to have occurred to her, for she had seen it painted on the plates we used for biscuits at Combray--as the thought of having had to dinner Ali Baba, who, as soon as he found himself alone and unobserved, would make his way into the cave, resplendent with its unsuspected treasures. One day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged pardon for being in evening clothes, Francoise, when he had gone, told us that she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining ""with a princess."" ""A pretty sort of princess,"" drawled my aunt; ""I know them,"" and she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her knitting, serenely ironical. Altogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was of the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations, she thought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in summer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden, and that from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some photographs of old masters for me. It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not seeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our house for the first time. If the conversation turned upon the Princes of the House of France, ""Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and don't want to, do we?"" my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his pocket; she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother's sister sang; manipulating this creature, so rare and refined at other times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from, the Swann created in my great-aunt's mind when, of an evening, in our little garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the gate, she would vitalise, by injecting into it everything she had ever heard about the Swann family, the vague and unrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its wake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as ""seeing some one we know"" is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We pack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to follow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent envelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no doubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family had left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his daily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so well lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family, that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann--this early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of",4.225230033890031,1.248811312398591,0.42048894879259113,0.03576860842662328,4.265078560567663,4.0,2.3060734189735714,65.76666666666667,59.0,47.22547570491541,1.2736948808920425,1.0,0.6320566211870298,1973,691,0.35022807906741005,8728,30,66.5333930471221,7.8539017245574905e+28,3.485975021996223e+25,0.8722152915494196,0.8593010263783591,32.32724640986656,25.088599594526105,14.362553787682575,28.658415272850142,31.54185335360703,8.828585909782056,81.73220138536915,10.5,True,1245.0,0.8801597869507324,3.873945849977807,2253.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008615845663982019,0.0043079228319910096,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01011425360554411,0.004214272335643379,0.006087282262595992,0.003550821127385708,3,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"from our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a solitary beacon in the night. These shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than a few seconds; it often happened that, in my spell of uncertainty as to where I was, I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that uncertainty was composed any more than, when we watch a horse running, we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon a bioscope. But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in which I had slept during my life, and in the end I would revisit them all in the long course of my waking dream: rooms in winter, where on going to bed I would at once bury my head in a nest, built up out of the most diverse materials, the corner of my pillow, the top of my blankets, a piece of a shawl, the edge of my bed, and a copy of an evening paper, all of which things I would contrive, with the infinite patience of birds building their nests, to cement into one whole; rooms where, in a keen frost, I would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the outer world (like the sea-swallow which builds at the end of a dark tunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth), and where, the fire keeping in all night, I would sleep wrapped up, as it were, in a great cloak of snug and savoury air, shot with the glow of the logs which would break out again in flame: in a sort of alcove without walls, a cave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat whose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature as gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face, from the corners of the room, or from parts near the window or far from the fireplace which had therefore remained cold--or rooms in summer, where I would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening, where the moonlight striking upon the half-opened shutters would throw down to the foot of my bed its enchanted ladder; where I would fall asleep, as it might be in the open air, like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised in the focus of a sunbeam--or sometimes the Louis XVI room, so cheerful that I could never feel really unhappy, even on my first night in it: that room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling would part, ever so gracefully, to indicate where the bed was and to keep it separate; sometimes again that little room with the high ceiling, hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys, and partly walled with mahogany, in which from the first moment my mind was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses, convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though I were not there; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet, which stood across one corner of the room, cleared for itself a site I had not looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of vision: that room in which my mind, forcing itself for hours on end to leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the exact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous funnel, had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched out in bed, my eyes staring upwards, my ears straining, my nostrils sniffing uneasily, and my heart beating; until custom had changed the colour of the curtains, made the clock keep quiet, brought an expression of pity to the cruel, slanting face of the glass, disguised or even completely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses, and distinctly reduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling. Custom! that skilful but unhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end with her provisional arrangements; whom the mind, for all that, is fortunate in discovering, for without the help of custom it would never contrive, by its own efforts, to make any room seem habitable. Certainly I was now well awake; my body had turned about for the last time and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding objects stand still, had set me down under my bedclothes, in my bedroom, and had fixed, approximately in their right places in the uncertain light, my chest of drawers, my writing-table, my fireplace, the window overlooking the street, and both the doors. But it was no good my knowing that I was not in any of those houses of which, in the stupid moment of waking, if I had not caught sight exactly, I could still believe in their possible presence; for memory was now set in motion; as a rule I did not attempt to go to sleep again at once, but used to spend the greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at Combray with my great-aunt, at Balbec, Paris, Doncieres, Venice, and the rest; remembering again all the places and people that I had known, what I had actually seen of them, and what others had told me. At Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should have to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy idea of giving me, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic lantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders and glass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours, in which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory window. But my sorrows were only increased, because this change of lighting destroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary impression I had formed of my room, thanks to which the room itself, but for the torture of having to go to bed in it, had become quite endurable. For now I no longer recognised it, and I became uneasy, as though I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging, in a place where I had just arrived, by train, for the first time. Riding at a jerky trot, Golo, his mind filled with an infamous design, issued from the little three-cornered forest which dyed dark-green the slope of a convenient hill, and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the castle of poor Genevieve de Brabant. This castle was cut off short by a curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the transparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through a slot in the lantern. It was only the wing of a castle, and in front of it stretched a moor on which Genevieve stood, lost in contemplation, wearing a blue girdle. The castle and the moor were yellow, but I could tell their colour without waiting to see them, for before the slides made their appearance the old-gold sonorous name of Brabant had given me an unmistakable clue. Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read aloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly to understand, for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty, so as to conform to the indications given in the text; then he rode away at the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest his slow progress. If the lantern were moved I could still distinguish Golo's horse advancing across the window-curtains, swelling out with their curves and diving into their folds. The body of Golo himself, being of the same supernatural substance as his steed's, overcame all material obstacles--everything that seemed to bar his way--by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself: the door-handle, for instance, over which, adapting itself at once, would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing its nobility or its melancholy, never shewing any sign of trouble at such a transubstantiation. And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed around me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express the discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things. The door-handle of my room, which was different to me from all the other doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord and without my having to turn it, so unconscious had its manipulation become; lo and behold, it was now an astral body for Golo. And as soon as the dinner-bell rang I would run down to the dining-room, where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef, shed the same light as on every other evening; and I would fall into the arms of my mother, whom the misfortunes of Genevieve de Brabant had made all the dearer to me, just as the crimes of Golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience. But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed talking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my grandmother, who held that ""It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country,"" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the very wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book instead of letting me stay out of doors. ""That is not the way to make him strong and active,"" she would say sadly, ""especially this little man, who needs all the strength and character that he can get."" My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an interest in meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him, looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard, not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my grandmother, in all weathers, even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Francoise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs, so that they should not get soaked--you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden, lashed by the storm, pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and rain. She would say, ""At last one can breathe!"" and would run up and down the soaking paths--too straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve--with her keen, jerky little",3.7783967401096117,1.1572893415341692,0.43335862765438954,0.05841564455644551,4.315283400809717,4.0,2.3581818162280097,63.74193548387097,45.0,101.1670505272489,1.2823886639676114,1.0,0.630061338470999,1976,757,0.38309716599190285,8787,31,71.48372062946012,1.109137566980222e+31,4.980411167401087e+27,0.8184756594399611,0.8195633222830707,33.646854512211064,24.401541073527493,14.179883828571004,27.84495233120021,30.765952559749252,9.109493927125506,80.69537677941753,10.806451612903226,True,1187.0,0.8881903906600809,3.9456668163448585,2227.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007637142591040328,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011176306230790724,0.005122473689112415,0.003352891869237217,0.004041311180960934,1,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity of my education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety (for that was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh despair. When these walks of my grandmother's took place after dinner there was one thing which never failed to bring her back to the house: that was if (at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her, moth-like, in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs were set out on the card-table) my great-aunt called out to her: ""Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!"" For, simply to tease her (she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my father's family that everyone made a joke of it), my great-aunt used to make my grandfather, who was forbidden liqueurs, take just a few drops. My poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to taste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops all the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties, of her in her weakness conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur-glass--all these were things of the sort to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at them, to take the tormentor's side with a. happy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her ""Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!"" in my cowardice I became at once a man, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and injustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the roof, which smelt of orris-root, and was scented also by a wild currant-bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through the half-opened window. Intended for a more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I could see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time my place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door I was allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of desire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate health, and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother's mind than any little breach of the rules by her husband, during those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening, in which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the heavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn, covered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon them either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an involuntary tear. My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma would come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw, rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared. Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to call her back, to say to her ""Kiss me just once again,"" but I knew that then she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom of having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was already crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she bent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host, for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of her real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come at all. Our 'guests' were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from a few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the house at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently since his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his wife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous, interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double peal--timid, oval, gilded--of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once exclaim ""A visitor! Who in the world can it be?"" but they knew quite well that it could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it stick out properly round his head. And there we would all stay, hanging on the words which would fall from my grandmother's lips when she brought us back her report of the enemy, as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of possible invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: ""I can hear Swann's voice."" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes, under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the Bressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible, so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going for anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my grandmother made a great point, thinking it 'nicer' of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors only. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my grandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann's father, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing would, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would hear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose bedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him for a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on the outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping profusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park, where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather by the arm and cried, ""Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be walking here together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty they are, all these trees--my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you have never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive all the same, my dear Amedee!"" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind: that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived her, ""It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I cannot think of her very much at any one time."" ""Often, but a little at a time, like poor old Swann,"" became one of my grandfather's favourite phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have assumed that this father of Swann's had been a monster if my grandfather, whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to",3.826192620008719,1.391224470000523,0.41121233509807764,0.05516815616918271,4.20738492665655,4.0,2.2417129104602207,50.69230769230769,54.0,37.35838480431638,1.2326757713707637,1.0,0.5604432928102253,1977,702,0.3550834597875569,8626,39,67.5158505384672,2.097786710677365e+29,9.265842361649139e+25,0.7620636744326666,0.7388342017861637,51.097937434341105,18.725574102175013,11.807384569943707,22.097863896346446,23.732936850706196,8.355508345978748,65.5633243842652,7.538461538461538,True,1234.0,0.8798586572438163,3.810070671378092,2264.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015317700453857792,0.011913767019667171,0.011913767019667171,0.011913767019667171,0.011913767019667171,0.011913767019667171,0.007564296520423601,0.004727685325264751,0.004916792738275341,0.002208480565371025,2,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"my childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is like the other people I knew at that time, as though one's life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a marked family likeness, the same (so to speak) tonality--this early Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree, of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon. And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady whom she had known at the Sacre Coeur (and with whom, because of our caste theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her: ""I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews, the des Laumes."" My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house, which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the tailor had made, saying to Mamma: ""Sevigne would not have said it better!"" and, by way of contrast, of a nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house: ""My dear, he is so common!"" Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we owed to Mme. de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and in allowing members of her family to associate with him. ""How should she know Swann? A lady who, you always made out, was related to Marshal MacMahon!"" This view of Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him justice, he never attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though he came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could establish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle, unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved. But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the Duc de X----, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental share in the private lives of men like Mole, the Duc Pasquier, or the Duc de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his 'proper station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and store up for their children's benefit, for my great-aunt had actually ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a 'Highness' and had thereby stepped down--in her eyes--from the respectable position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my grandmother's two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the 'pinchbeck' things of life, even when they had an historic value, or, generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday life that their sense of hearing--which had gradually come to understand its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table, became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves--would leave its receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or because they think the whole world a trifle mad. Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the _Figaro_ in which to the name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words, ""from the collection of M. Charles Swann,"" asked: ""Did you see that Swann is 'mentioned' in the _Figaro_?"" ""But I have always told you,"" said my grandmother, ""that he had plenty of taste."" ""You would, of course,"" retorted my great-aunt, ""say anything just to seem different from _us_."" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force us into solidarity with her own. But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to mention to Swann this reference to him in the _Figaro_, my great-aunt dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial, which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy them. ""I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it."" She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage. ""You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very hard for him."" My father, however, was annoyed: ""No, no; you have the most absurd ideas. It would be utterly ridiculous."" But the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave rise to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family: I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others, and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock, when it was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going to sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it instantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly free to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut. We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting. ""See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,"" my grandfather warned his two sisters-in-law; ""you know how good it is, and it is a huge case."" ""Now, don't start whispering!"" said my great-aunt. ""How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?"" ""Ah! There's M. Swann,"" cried my father. ""Let's ask him if he thinks it will be fine to-morrow."" My mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me. ""Now, M. Swann,"" she said, ""do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa."" ""Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,"" said my grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but",3.367012356890867,1.192293780302876,0.41351365727670514,0.07145556666739841,4.300405268490375,4.0,2.391607632911386,35.89090909090909,26.0,33.15236052326384,1.2933130699088147,1.0,0.6434030175719313,1974,693,0.35106382978723405,8857,55,70.9218701425926,6.32378140475144e+30,2.737567707684606e+27,0.7745417820082771,0.7624961171510085,60.99144155844158,13.66854877037856,12.11234088106696,17.112189370912777,16.770363360044215,8.66166160081054,52.760210002763195,6.054545454545455,True,1244.0,0.8627705627705627,3.8341991341991344,2310.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009900990099009901,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006477283242342926,0.006477283242342926,0.007217544184324975,0.004761904761904762,4,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not put in writing. My fear was that Francoise, my aunt's cook who used to be put in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my note. I had a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to my mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable, just as it would be for the door-keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor upon the stage. For things which might or might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, abundant, subtle, and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement, against ""seething the kid in his mother's milk,"" or ""eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow of the thigh."" This code, if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social complications and refinements of fashion as nothing in Francoise's surroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could have put into her head; and we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past existence in the ancient history of France, noble and little understood, just as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still testify to their former courtly days, and chemical workers toil among delicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of Theophilus or the Quatre Fils Aymon. In this particular instance, the article of her code which made it highly improbable that--barring an outbreak of fire--Francoise would go down and disturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a person as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family (as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also for the stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have found touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her lips, because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it, and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect of making her decline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one chance of success I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not in the least myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who, on saying good night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her an answer about something she had asked me to find, and that she would certainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her. I think that Francoise disbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs imperceptible by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five minutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents, or tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter. Then she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply: ""What a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this!"" A moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage and that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once, in front of everybody; but that when the finger-bowls were put round he would find a way of slipping it into Mamma's hand. At once my anxiety subsided; it was now no longer (as it had been a moment ago) until to-morrow that I had lost my mother, for my little line was going--to annoy her, no doubt, and doubly so because this contrivance would make me ridiculous in Swann's eyes--but was going all the same to admit me, invisibly and by stealth, into the same room as herself, was going to whisper from me into her ear; for that forbidden and unfriendly dining-room, where but a moment ago the ice itself--with burned nuts in it--and the finger-bowls seemed to me to be concealing pleasures that were mischievous and of a mortal sadness because Mamma was tasting of them and I was far away, had opened its doors to me and, like a ripe fruit which bursts through its skin, was going to pour out into my intoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of Mamma's attention while she was reading what I had written. Now I was no longer separated from her; the barriers were down; an exquisite thread was binding us. Besides, that was not all, for surely Mamma would come. As for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann would have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had guessed its purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due course, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years, and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot follow--to him that anguish came through Love, to which it is in a sense predestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but when, as had befallen me, such an anguish possesses one's soul before Love has yet entered into one's life, then it must drift, awaiting Love's coming, vague and free, without precise attachment, at the disposal of one sentiment to-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety or affection for a comrade. And the joy with which I first bound myself apprentice, when Francoise returned to tell me that my letter would be delivered; Swann, too, had known well that false joy which a friend can give us, or some relative of the woman we love, when on his arrival at the house or theatre where she is to be found, for some ball or party or 'first-night' at which he is to meet her, he sees us wandering outside, desperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her. He recognises us, greets us familiarly, and asks what we are doing there. And when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be more simple, takes us in at the door, and promises to send her down to us in five minutes. How much we love him--as at that moment I loved Francoise--the good-natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable, human, almost propitious the inconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in the thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies, perverse and seductive, beguiling away from us, even making laugh at us, the woman whom we love. If we are to judge of them by him, this relative who has accosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries, then the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal. Those inaccessible and torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown pleasures--behold, a breach in the wall, and we are through it. Behold, one of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum, a moment as genuine as the rest, if not actually more important to ourself because our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture it to ourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have created it: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting there below. And very probably the other moments of the party will not be essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so well able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that ""Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more amusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there."" Alas! Swann had learned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are powerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even into a ball-room by a man whom she does not love. Too often, the kind friend comes down again alone. My mother did not appear, but with no attempt to safeguard my self-respect (which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she had asked me to let her know the result of my search for something or other) made Francoise tell me, in so many words ""There is no answer""--words I have so often, since then, heard the hall-porters in 'mansions' and the flunkeys in gambling-clubs and the like, repeat to some poor girl, who replies in bewilderment: ""What! he's said nothing? It's not possible. You did give him my letter, didn't you? Very well, I shall wait a little longer."" And just as she invariably protests that she does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for her, and sits on there, hearing nothing further, except an occasional remark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger whom he will send off suddenly, when he notices the time, to put some customer's wine on the ice; so, having declined Francoise's offer to make me some tea or to stay beside me, I let her go off again to the servants' hall, and lay down and shut my eyes, and tried not to hear the voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden. But after a few seconds I realised that, by writing that line to Mamma, by approaching--at the risk of making her angry--so near to her that I felt I could reach out and grasp the moment in which I should see her again, I had cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep until I actually had seen her, and my heart began to beat more and more painfully as I increased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm and to acquiesce in my ill-fortune. Then, suddenly, my anxiety subsided, a feeling of intense happiness coursed through me, as when a strong medicine begins to take effect and one's pain vanishes: I had formed a resolution to abandon all attempts to go to sleep without seeing Mamma, and had decided to kiss her at all costs, even with the certainty of being in disgrace with her for long afterwards, when she herself came up to bed. The tranquillity which followed my anguish made me extremely alert, no less than my sense of expectation, my thirst for and my fear of danger. Noiselessly I opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed; hardly daring to move in case they should hear me from below. Things outside seemed also fixed in mute expectation, so as not to disturb the moonlight which, duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the extension, forwards, of a shadow denser and more concrete than its substance, had made the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer, like a map which, after being folded up,",3.530040925908202,1.3426118727421334,0.4386436847284957,0.04822620413567652,4.2712121212121215,4.0,2.3462154235258215,49.5,44.0,40.844216236818646,1.3025252525252524,1.0,0.648925831055287,1980,717,0.3621212121212121,8743,40,66.11825729369922,5.185543666337069e+28,2.317043640007627e+25,0.808710404791129,0.8003597463432112,46.398863636363686,19.08479797979798,12.857556352371635,22.143434343434347,23.437409090909092,8.716747474747475,66.62121212121212,8.475,True,1283.0,0.8914209115281502,3.9066130473637175,2238.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0035537267371177407,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0065463387262695225,0.0,0.0,0.002234137622877569,6,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"is spread out upon the ground. What had to move--a leaf of the chestnut-tree, for instance--moved. But its minute shuddering, complete, finished to the least detail and with utmost delicacy of gesture, made no discord with the rest of the scene, and yet was not merged in it, remaining clearly outlined. Exposed upon this surface of silence, which absorbed nothing from them, the most distant sounds, those which must have come from gardens at the far end of the town, could be distinguished with such exact 'finish' that the impression they gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their 'pianissimo' execution, like those movements on muted strings so well performed by the orchestra of the Conservatoire that, although one does not lose a single note, one thinks all the same that they are being played somewhere outside, a long way from the concert hall, so that all the old subscribers, and my grandmother's sisters too, when Swann had given them his seats, used to strain their ears as if they had caught the distant approach of an army on the march, which had not yet rounded the corner of the Rue de Trevise. I was well aware that I had placed myself in a position than which none could be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my parents' hands; consequences far graver, indeed, than a stranger would have imagined, and such as (he would have thought) could follow only some really shameful fault. But in the system of education which they had given me faults were not classified in the same order as in that of other children, and I had been taught to place at the head of the list (doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which I needed to be more carefully protected) those in which I can now distinguish the common feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to a nervous impulse. But such words as these last had never been uttered in my hearing; no one had yet accounted for my temptations in a way which might have led me to believe that there was some excuse for my giving in to them, or that I was actually incapable of holding out against them. Yet I could easily recognise this class of transgressions by the anguish of mind which preceded, as well as by the rigour of the punishment which followed them; and I knew that what I had just done was in the same category as certain other sins for which I had been severely chastised, though infinitely more serious than they. When I went out to meet my mother as she herself came up to bed, and when she saw that I had remained up so as to say good night to her again in the passage, I should not be allowed to stay in the house a day longer, I should be packed off to school next morning; so much was certain. Very good: had I been obliged, the next moment, to hurl myself out of the window, I should still have preferred such a fate. For what I wanted now was Mamma, and to say good night to her. I had gone too far along the road which led to the realisation of this desire to be able to retrace my steps. I could hear my parents' footsteps as they went with Swann; and, when the rattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone, I crept to the window. Mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster good, and whether M. Swann had had some of the coffee-and-pistachio ice. ""I thought it rather so-so,"" she was saying; ""next time we shall have to try another flavour."" ""I can't tell you,"" said my great-aunt, ""what a change I find in Swann. He is quite antiquated!"" She had grown so accustomed to seeing Swann always in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to find him suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him. And the others too were beginning to remark in Swann that abnormal, excessive, scandalous senescence, meet only in a celibate, in one of that class for whom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow must be longer than for other men, since for such a one it is void of promise, and from its dawn the moments steadily accumulate without any subsequent partition among his offspring. ""I fancy he has a lot of trouble with that wretched wife of his, who 'lives' with a certain Monsieur de Charlus, as all Combray knows. It's the talk of the town."" My mother observed that, in spite of this, he had looked much less unhappy of late. ""And he doesn't nearly so often do that trick of his, so like his father, of wiping his eyes and passing his hand across his forehead. I think myself that in his heart of hearts he doesn't love his wife any more."" ""Why, of course he doesn't,"" answered my grandfather. ""He wrote me a letter about it, ages ago, to which I took care to pay no attention, but it left no doubt as to his feelings, let alone his love for his wife. Hullo! you two; you never thanked him for the Asti!"" he went on, turning to his sisters-in-law. ""What! we never thanked him? I think, between you and me, that I put it to him quite neatly,"" replied my aunt Flora. ""Yes, you managed it very well; I admired you for it,"" said my aunt Celine. ""But you did it very prettily, too."" ""Yes; I liked my expression about 'nice neighbours.'"" ""What! Do you call that thanking him?"" shouted my grandfather. ""I heard that all right, but devil take me if I guessed it was meant for Swann. You may be quite sure he never noticed it."" ""Come, come; Swann is not a fool. I am positive he appreciated the compliment. You didn't expect me to tell him the number of bottles, or to guess what he paid for them."" My father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my father said: ""Well, shall we go up to bed?"" ""As you wish, dear, though I don't feel in the least like sleeping. I don't know why; it can't be the coffee-ice--it wasn't strong enough to keep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants' hall: poor Francoise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me while you go and undress."" My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the staircase. Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I went quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I could hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety, but with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light coming upwards, from Mamma's candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw myself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not realising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression of anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used to go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences than this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility, and that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as indicating that, with such a punishment as was in store for me, mere silence, and even anger, were relatively puerile. A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice; the kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which would have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the dressing-room, where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid the 'scene' which he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice half-stifled by her anger: ""Run away at once. Don't let your father see you standing there like a crazy jane!"" But I begged her again to ""Come and say good night to me!"" terrified as I saw the light from my father's candle already creeping up the wall, but also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope that my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must if she continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: ""Go back to your room. I will come."" Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one heard me, ""I am done for!"" I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters granted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to 'Principles,' and because in his sight there were no such things as 'Rights of Man.' For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at all, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular walk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening, long before the appointed hour he would snap out: ""Run along up to bed now; no excuses!"" But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: ""Go along with him, then; you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his room for a little. I don't need anything."" ""But dear,"" my mother answered timidly, ""whether or not I feel like sleep is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed..."" ""There's no question of making him accustomed,"" said my father, with a shrug of the shoulders; ""you can see quite well that the child is unhappy. After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill, and a lot of good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Francoise to make up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I'm off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you. Good night."" It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my sentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring to move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white nightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere in which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up his head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli which M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase, up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have",2.975061418575656,1.1271869605099945,0.43168062007028607,0.07182082656515537,4.0784114052953155,4.0,2.184457764489707,23.951219512195124,16.0,23.049735429953177,1.2184317718940938,1.0,0.53268560721989,1964,657,0.3345213849287169,8412,82,72.64481182486668,3.5419376708785928e+31,1.5234140519907925e+28,0.734085933799729,0.7123259200190659,79.44518429288163,8.128470518106408,8.700769036622557,11.169082509562367,9.7549274750385,6.945213849287168,37.90233967512791,3.341463414634146,True,1296.0,0.8541935483870968,3.6180645161290323,2325.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004632310364794441,0.004632310364794441,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008685581933989578,0.0019301293186643506,0.004921829762594094,0.0012903225806451613,7,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the discovery of their finest lines. ""We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,"" she said, or rather whispered to Swann. ""It is only a mother who can understand. I am sure that hers would agree with me."" And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with: ""Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening."" ""To be sure!"" said her sister Flora, ""but I haven't wasted my time either. I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides."" ""M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,"" cried my aunt Celine in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long; darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann. And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was Celine's way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense. ""I think it would be worth while,"" Flora went on, ""to have this old gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will talk for hours on end."" ""That must be delightful,"" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Mole or of the Comte de Paris. ""I say!"" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, ""what I was going to tell you has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now, for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night."" ""I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the papers very pleasant indeed!"" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that she had read the note about his Corot in the _Figaro_. ""Yes,"" aunt Celine went one better. ""When they write about things or people in whom we are interested."" ""I don't deny it,"" answered Swann in some bewilderment. ""The fault I find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it--oh! I don't know; shall we say Pascal's _Pensees_?"" He articulated the title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. ""And then, in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,"" he went on, shewing that contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to affect, ""we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at Cannes, or that the Princesse de Leon had given a fancy dress ball. In that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information' and 'publicity.'"" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: ""We are having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits,"" and then, turning to my grandfather: ""Well, Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'"" ""Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very different!"" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both. Celine began to laugh. Swann was puzzled, but went on: ""'I cannot say whether it was his ignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'"" My grandfather was already in ecstasies over ""ignorance or a trap,"" but Miss Celine--the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having arrested the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing--had grown angry. ""What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the point of it? Does he mean that one man isn't as good as another? What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his children, your Saint-Simon, if he didn't teach them to shake hands with all honest men. Really and truly, it's abominable. And you dare to quote it!"" And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: ""Just tell me again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these occasions. Oh, yes: What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor! Good, that is, very good. I never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table I should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time, and that Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to give her in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my room. And so I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began to eat and drink and as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand into this kiss, which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in execution, everything that my own efforts could put into it: would look out very carefully first the exact spot on her cheek where I would imprint it, and would so prepare my thoughts that I might be able, thanks to these mental preliminaries, to consecrate the whole of the minute Mamma would allow me to the sensation of her cheek against my lips, as a painter who can have his subject for short sittings only prepares his palette, and from what he remembers and from rough notes does in advance everything which he possibly can do in the sitter's absence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my grandfather said with unconscious cruelty: ""The little man looks tired; he'd better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night."" And my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in observing the letter of a treaty, went on: ""Yes, run along; to bed with you."" I would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the dinner-bell rang. ""No, no, leave your mother alone. You've said good night quite enough. These exhibitions are absurd. Go on upstairs."" And so I must set forth without viaticum; must climb each step of the staircase 'against my heart,' as the saying is, climbing in opposition to my heart's desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had not, by her kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That hateful staircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out a smell of varnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and fixed the special quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made it perhaps even more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed this olfactory guise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we have gone to sleep with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it only as a little girl whom we attempt, time after time, to pull out of the water, or as a line of Moliere which we repeat incessantly to ourselves, it is a great relief to wake up, so that our intelligence can disentangle the idea of toothache from any artificial semblance of heroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the precise converse of this relief which I felt when my anguish at having to go up to my room invaded my consciousness in a manner infinitely more rapid, instantaneous almost, a manner at once insidious and brutal as I breathed in--a far more poisonous thing than any moral penetration--the peculiar smell of the varnish upon that staircase. Once in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to dig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the shroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which had been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the red curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted the desperate stratagem of",3.123159094036886,1.1502029859610696,0.4152944126970936,0.07121891766305621,4.289620253164557,4.0,2.3649697956365854,27.430555555555557,17.5,25.915367807157338,1.2820253164556963,1.0,0.6356146825518845,1975,717,0.3630379746835443,8867,72,71.44311719334728,1.0650048046203907e+31,4.5669159717855516e+27,0.7172631607718871,0.6939623758995107,70.53364433895922,10.235815400843887,10.656304134559745,13.503867791842476,12.48938917018284,8.34387848101266,43.63308720112518,4.444444444444445,True,1225.0,0.8546312178387651,3.8023156089193826,2332.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00979938984931127,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006656189331607654,0.0018489414810021264,0.0,0.005145797598627788,5,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"perished which, I imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long time, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to ""Go with the child."" Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have been increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the sobs which I had the strength to control in my father's presence, and which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again through the silent evening air. Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature, which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening, a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother: ""Go and comfort him."" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Francoise (who guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to her: ""But, Madame, what is little Master crying for?"" she replied: ""Why, Francoise, he doesn't know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed for me quickly and then go off to your own."" And thus for the first time my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no small degree of pride, either, in Francoise's presence at this return to humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep, raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to have been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first time she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era, must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I should have said to Mamma: ""No, I don't want you; you mustn't sleep here."" But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me that this should not have happened; her anger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as she saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: ""Why, my little buttercup, my little canary-boy, he's going to make Mamma as silly as himself if this goes on. Look, since you can't sleep, and Mamma can't either, we mustn't go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I'll get one of your books."" But I had none there. ""Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday? Just think it over first, and don't be disappointed if there is nothing new for you then."" I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped, any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year before. It contained _La Mare au Diable_, _Francois le Champi_, _La Petite Fadette_, and _Les Maitres Sonneurs_. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of Rousseau, and _Indiana_; for while she considered light reading as unwholesome as sweets and cakes, she did not reflect that the strong breath of genius must have upon the very soul of a child an influence at once more dangerous and less quickening than those of fresh air and country breezes upon his body. But when my father had seemed almost to regard her as insane on learning the names of the books she proposed to give me, she had journeyed back by herself to Jouy-le-Vicomte to the bookseller's, so that there should be no fear of my not having my present in time (it was a burning hot day, and she had come home so unwell that the doctor had warned my mother not to allow her again to tire herself in that way), and had there fallen back upon the four pastoral novels of George Sand. ""My dear,"" she had said to Mamma, ""I could not allow myself to give the child anything that was not well written."" The truth was that she could never make up her mind to purchase anything from which no intellectual profit was to be derived, and, above all, that profit which good things bestowed on us by teaching us to seek our pleasures elsewhere than in the barren satisfaction of worldly wealth. Even when she had to make some one a present of the kind called 'useful,' when she had to give an armchair or some table-silver or a walking-stick, she would choose 'antiques,' as though their long desuetude had effaced from them any semblance of utility and fitted them rather to instruct us in the lives of the men of other days than to serve the common requirements of our own. She would have liked me to have in my room photographs of ancient buildings or of beautiful places. But at the moment of buying them, and for all that the subject of the picture had an aesthetic value of its own, she would find that vulgarity and utility had too prominent a part in them, through the mechanical nature of their reproduction by photography. She attempted by a subterfuge, if not to eliminate altogether their commercial banality, at least to minimise it, to substitute for the bulk of it what was art still, to introduce, as it might be, several 'thicknesses' of art; instead of photographs of Chartres Cathedral, of the Fountains of Saint-Cloud, or of Vesuvius she would inquire of Swann whether some great painter had not made pictures of them, and preferred to give me photographs of 'Chartres Cathedral' after Corot, of the 'Fountains of Saint-Cloud' after Hubert Robert, and of 'Vesuvius' after Turner, which were a stage higher in the scale of art. But although the photographer had been prevented from reproducing directly the masterpieces or the beauties of nature, and had there been replaced by a great artist, he resumed his odious position when it came to reproducing the artist's interpretation. Accordingly, having to reckon again with vulgarity, my grandmother would endeavour to postpone the moment of contact still further. She would ask Swann if the picture had not been engraved, preferring, when possible, old engravings with some interest of association apart from themselves, such, for example, as shew us a masterpiece in a state in which we can no longer see it to-day, as Morghen's print of the 'Cenacolo' of Leonardo before it was spoiled by restoration. It must be admitted that the results of this method of interpreting the art of making presents were not always happy. The idea which I formed of Venice, from a drawing by Titian which is supposed to have the lagoon in the background, was certainly far less accurate than what I have since derived from ordinary photographs. We could no longer keep count in the family (when my great-aunt tried to frame an indictment of my grandmother) of all the armchairs she had presented to married couples, young and old, which on a first attempt to sit down upon them had at once collapsed beneath the weight of their recipient. But my grandmother would have thought it sordid to concern herself too closely with the solidity of any piece of furniture in which could still be discerned a flourish, a smile, a brave conceit of the past. And even what in such pieces supplied a material need, since it did so in a manner to which we are no longer accustomed, was as charming to her as one of those old forms of speech in which we can still see traces of a metaphor whose fine point has been worn away by the rough usage of our modern tongue.

"the same way the pastoral novels of George Sand, which she was giving me for my birthday, were regular lumber-rooms of antique furniture, full of expressions that have fallen out of use and returned as imagery, such as one finds now only in country dialects. And my grandmother had bought them in preference to other books, just as she would have preferred to take a house that had a gothic dovecot, or some other such piece of antiquity as would have a pleasant effect on the mind, filling it with a nostalgic longing for impossible journeys through the realms of time. Mamma sat down by my bed; she had chosen _Francois le Champi_, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality in my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real novels. I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist. That prepared me in advance to imagine that _Francois le Champi_ contained something inexpressibly delicious. The course of the narrative, where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain modes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with a little experience, he may recognise as 'common form' in novels, seemed to me then distinctive--for to me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects, but was like an individual man, unmatched, and with no cause of existence beyond himself--an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of _Francois le Champi_. Beneath the everyday incidents, the commonplace thoughts and hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an intonation, a rhythmic utterance fine and strange. The 'action' began: to me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days, when I read to myself, I used often, while I turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd changes which take place in the relations between the miller's wife and the boy, changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery, the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that strange and pleasant-sounding name of _Champi_, which draped the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour, purpurate and charming. If my mother was not a faithful reader, she was, none the less, admirable when reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice. It was the same in her daily life, when it was not works of art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was touching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice, her gestures, from her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might have distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the recollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the burden of his years, now the household topic which might have bored some young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the prose of George Sand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral distinction which Mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above all other qualities in life, and which I was not to teach her until much later to refrain from placing, in the same way, above all other qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from her voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural tenderness, all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed to have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to speak, within her compass. She came to them with the tone that they required, with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which dictated them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and by these means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there might be or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and the preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the melancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing to an end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now slackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their difference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this quite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling. My agony was soothed; I let myself be borne upon the current of this gentle night on which I had my mother by my side. I knew that such a night could not be repeated; that the strongest desire I had in the world, namely, to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of darkness, ran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes of others for such a concession as had been granted me this evening to be anything but a rare and casual exception. To-morrow night I should again be the victim of anguish and Mamma would not stay by my side. But when these storms of anguish grew calm I could no longer realise their existence; besides, tomorrow evening was still a long way off; I reminded myself that I should still have time to think about things, albeit that remission of time could bring me no access of power, albeit the coming event was in no way dependent upon the exercise of my will, and seemed not quite inevitable only because it was still separated from me by this short interval. * * * And so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake at night and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than this sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy background, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign will illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other parts of which remain plunged in darkness: broad enough at its base, the little parlour, the dining-room, the alluring shadows of the path along which would come M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the hall through which I would journey to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb, which constituted, all by itself, the tapering 'elevation' of an irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter; in a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though there had been no time there but seven o'clock at night. I must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these. But since the facts which I should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an exercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the pictures which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this residue of Combray. To me it was in reality all dead. Permanently dead? Very possibly. There is a large element of hazard in these matters, and a second hazard, that of our own death, often prevents us from awaiting for any length of time the favours of the first. I feel that there is much to be said for the Celtic belief that the souls of those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior being, in an animal, in a plant, in some inanimate object, and so effectively lost to us until the day (which to many never comes) when we happen to pass by the tree or to obtain possession of the object which forms their prison. Then they start and tremble, they call us by our name, and as soon as we have recognised their voice the spell is broken. We have delivered them: they have overcome death and return to share our life. And so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) which we do not suspect. And as for that object, it depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must die. Many years had elapsed during which nothing of Combray, save what was comprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there, had any existence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my mother, seeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did not ordinarily take. I declined at first, and then, for no particular reason, changed my mind. She sent out for one of those short, plump little cakes called 'petites madeleines,' which look as though they had been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell. And soon, mechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory--this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy? I was conscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake, but that it infinitely transcended those savours, could not, indeed, be of the same nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it signify? How could I seize upon and define it? I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first, a third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time to stop; the potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object of my quest, the truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has called up in me, but does not itself understand, and can only repeat indefinitely with a gradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which I, too, cannot interpret, though I hope at least to be able to",3.131743614452389,1.5367731490803154,0.41252605814929755,0.12539327764868108,4.3500255493101685,4.0,2.341035205803124,36.924528301886795,25.0,40.22101631087146,1.2994379151762903,1.0,0.6467280890042976,1957,744,0.38017373530914667,8785,53,70.39346987935505,3.7281684822311925e+30,1.6808694689951272e+27,0.7807573449726288,0.7081930017938801,59.424156149670765,14.143933436816077,12.007035507082968,17.386060682021963,17.52088448819429,8.976515074092998,54.7068481792501,6.566037735849057,True,1216.0,0.8836789900811542,3.960775473399459,2218.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01080577550069865,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007452258965999069,0.0059618071727992545,0.005309734513274336,0.002705139765554554,9,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"call upon the tea for it again and to find it there presently, intact and at my disposal, for my final enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my own mind. It is for it to discover the truth. But how? What an abyss of uncertainty whenever the mind feels that some part of it has strayed beyond its own borders; when it, the seeker, is at once the dark region through which it must go seeking, where all its equipment will avail it nothing. Seek? More than that: create. It is face to face with something which does not so far exist, to which it alone can give reality and substance, which it alone can bring into the light of day. And I begin again to ask myself what it could have been, this unremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its existence, but only the sense that it was a happy, that it was a real state in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and vanished. I decide to attempt to make it reappear. I retrace my thoughts to the moment at which I drank the first spoonful of tea. I find again the same state, illumined by no fresh light. I compel my mind to make one further effort, to follow and recapture once again the fleeting sensation. And that nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out every obstacle, every extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit all attention to the sounds which come from the next room. And then, feeling that my mind is growing fatigued without having any success to report, I compel it for a change to enjoy that distraction which I have just denied it, to think of other things, to rest and refresh itself before the supreme attempt. And then for the second time I clear an empty space in front of it. I place in position before my mind's eye the still recent taste of that first mouthful, and I feel something start within me, something that leaves its resting-place and attempts to rise, something that has been embedded like an anchor at a great depth; I do not know yet what it is, but I can feel it mounting slowly; I can measure the resistance, I can hear the echo of great spaces traversed. Undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must be the image, the visual memory which, being linked to that taste, has tried to follow it into my conscious mind. But its struggles are too far off, too much confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless reflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of radiant hues, and I cannot distinguish its form, cannot invite it, as the one possible interpreter, to translate to me the evidence of its contemporary, its inseparable paramour, the taste of cake soaked in tea; cannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question, of what period in my past life. Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being? I cannot tell. Now that I feel nothing, it has stopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who can say whether it will ever rise? Ten times over I must essay the task, must lean down over the abyss. And each time the natural laziness which deters us from every difficult enterprise, every work of importance, has urged me to leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely of the worries of to-day and of my hopes for to-morrow, which let themselves be pondered over without effort or distress of mind. And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before church-time), when I went to say good day to her in her bedroom, my aunt Leonie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the forms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness. But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection. And once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had been all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon, the streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet, stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, permanent and recognisable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann's park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of Combray and of its surroundings, taking their proper shapes and growing solid, sprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea. Combray at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt's house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de l'Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesche, from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make Golo's acquaintance and to chat with Genevieve de Brabant. My grandfather's cousin--by courtesy my great-aunt--with whom we used to stay, was the mother of that aunt Leonie who, since her husband's (my uncle Octave's) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray, then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who now never 'came down,' but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pre (as distinct from the Petit-Pre, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt's life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they aired the other. They were rooms of that country order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see) fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I",3.493474434461903,1.6660284403041818,0.4393887431806957,0.07099075318894965,4.39979808177688,4.0,2.3391581256114753,52.13157894736842,33.5,56.005719187574506,1.2791519434628975,1.0,0.6048053304711266,1981,758,0.38263503281171124,9020,38,73.27022189587834,6.619924817841619e+31,2.9188381031047705e+28,0.7727733636023225,0.7920725759532716,45.70519295145995,19.835308722335878,13.023866798666859,23.154499322511228,25.35883843885332,9.503018677435634,69.84990302611652,9.236842105263158,True,1182.0,0.8774250440917107,3.9770723104056436,2268.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007839562443026436,0.0040109389243391065,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008204193254329991,0.004740200546946217,0.0051048313582497725,0.005731922398589065,10,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"had just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already 'raised' and started to 'set,' puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the flowered quilt. In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: ""I must not forget that I never slept a wink""--for ""never sleeping a wink"" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Francoise would not 'call' her, but would simply 'come to' her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished to 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say ""what made me wake up,"" or ""I dreamed that,"" she would flush and at once correct herself. After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Francoise would be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask instead for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details--the charming prodigality of the chemist--details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses--marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been 'in bloom'--shewed me that these were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower. Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft. At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-Celestins, might be found her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Francoise. I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns--or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to me: ""Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and if you see Francoise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything."" Francoise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to Combray, and when my aunt Leonie used still to spend the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Francoise so little that on New Year's Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said: ""Now, be careful. Don't make any mistake. Wait until you hear me say 'Good morning, Francoise,' and I touch your arm before you give it to her."" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Francoise, motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: ""Good morning, Francoise."" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Francoise. We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family' (for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of him, and whether he took after his granny. Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Francoise was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and their lives. She had guessed that Francoise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when Francoise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to her, with a smile: ""Tell me, Francoise, if Julien has had to go away, and you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will make the best of it, won't you?"" And Francoise answered, laughing: ""Madame knows everything; Madame is worse than the X-rays"" (she pronounced 'x' with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman's, daring to employ a scientific term) ""they brought here for Mme. Octave, which see what is in your heart""--and she went off, disturbed that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself. My aunt resigned herself to doing without Francoise to some extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether",4.056338129289917,1.1725438250249873,0.43307503282626303,0.04594613925451913,4.333333333333333,4.0,2.274107222829514,59.81818181818182,48.0,47.74201792427812,1.2664640324214793,1.0,0.5877161672830408,1974,754,0.3819655521783181,8884,33,67.3789133596828,1.8293224691378586e+29,8.058689291356206e+25,0.82261798158288,0.8037865507987237,38.97668831168832,22.68336649166437,12.872792785125622,25.872561481072122,28.88909090909091,9.185167173252275,76.83945841392651,10.181818181818182,True,1210.0,0.8744493392070485,3.913656387665198,2270.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007937973047812442,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009414805242754292,0.004153590548273953,0.0,0.0052863436123348016,11,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"she was well or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality. When Francoise, having seen that my parents had everything they required, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to some important event. ""Just fancy, Francoise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should not be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation."" ""Well, there'd be nothing wonderful in that,"" would be the answer. ""Francoise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme. Imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot has: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you've been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able to get some like these for our visitors."" ""I shouldn't be surprised if they came from the Cure's,"" Francoise would say, and: ""I'm sure you wouldn't, my poor Francoise,"" my aunt would reply, raising her shoulders. ""From the Cure's, indeed! You know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus at all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of course, but my poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year."" ""Francoise, didn't you hear that bell just now! It split my head."" ""No, Mme. Octave."" ""Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that. It was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once and they went off along the Rue de l'Oiseau. There must be some child ill."" ""Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!"" would come with a sigh from Francoise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to lament. ""Francoise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of course, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten that she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called me home too; I don't know what has become of my head since I lost my poor Octave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl."" ""Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time didn't sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn't gone out."" In this way Francoise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for Francoise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house. ""But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,"" Francoise would begin. ""Are you feeling faint?"" ""No, thank you, Francoise,"" my aunt would reply, ""that is to say, yes; for you know well that there is very seldom a time when I don't feel faint; one day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am; but that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn't know at all. Run and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It's not often that Theodore can't tell you who a person is."" ""But that must be M. Pupin's daughter,"" Francoise would say, preferring to stick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice already into Camus's shop that morning. ""M. Pupin's daughter! Oh, that's a likely story, my poor Francoise. Do you think I should not have recognised M. Pupin's daughter!"" ""But I don't mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one who goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already this morning."" ""Oh, if that's what it is!"" my aunt would say, ""she must have come over for the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over for the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and ring her sister's door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the boy from Galopin's go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for Mme. Goupil."" ""Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won't be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it's not so early as it was,"" would be the answer, for Francoise, who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction. ""Oh! not before midday!"" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation, darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle. ""And it will come in the middle of my luncheon!"" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time. ""At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates?"" These were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her spectacles and spell out: ""Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,"" ""Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,"" and smile, and say ""Very good indeed."" ""I may as well go across to Camus..."" Francoise would hazard, seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there. ""No, no; it's not worth while now; it's certain to be the Pupin girl. My poor Francoise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing."" But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for Francoise, since at Combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was as incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena, careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be Mme. Sauton's son discharged from the army, or the Abbe Perdreau's niece come home from her convent, or the Cure's brother, a tax-collector at Chateaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't know at all,' simply because you had failed to recognise or identify them at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Cure had given warning that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom my grandfather didn't know: ""A man grandfather didn't know at all!"" she would exclaim. ""That's a likely story."" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would be summoned. ""Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn't know at all?"" ""Why, of course I did,"" my grandfather would answer; ""it was Prosper, Mme. Bouilleboeuf's gardener's brother."" ""Ah, well!"" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; ""and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all!"" After which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours. ""That will be Mme. Sazerat's dog,"" Francoise would suggest, without any real conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not 'split her head. ""As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!""--for my aunt's critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact. ""Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from Lisieux."" ""Oh, if that's what it is!"" ""It seems, it's a most engaging animal,"" Francoise would go on, having got the story from Theodore, ""as clever as a Christian, always in a good temper, always friendly, always everything that's nice. It's not often you see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it's high time I left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's nearly ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I've still to dress the asparagus."" ""What, Francoise, more asparagus! It's a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it."" ""No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They'll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won't eat it out of the back of their spoons, you'll see."" ""Church! why, they must be there now; you'd better not lose any time. Go and look after your luncheon."" While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Francoise I would have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it still, our church at Combray!

"which we went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the hall--all sculptured stone and painted glass--of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise--the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire--the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock's tail, then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was following my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of forget-me-nots in glass. Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of Guermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one another, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch of red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite 'gone' at the top, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing upper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was said, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people's supernatural passage--all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space--the name of the fourth being Time--which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat's wing of stone, Theodore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert's little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, ""by a crystal lamp which, on the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way."" And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but instinctively I exclaimed ""The Church!"" The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue Saint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours, Mme. Loiseau's house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its walls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might have had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne numbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau's and after leaving M. Rapin's, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss. From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering continually in all directions, he would say: ""Come, get your wraps together, we are there."" And on one of the longest walks we ever took from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire's steeple, but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this single",4.318200753562059,1.466999673524419,0.46164426436684985,0.06047253608256543,4.465151515151515,4.0,2.303115528726104,90.0,71.0,93.06058632564448,1.261111111111111,1.0,0.5764772659518946,1980,811,0.40959595959595957,9122,22,67.74265841293229,2.6318597250916304e+29,1.1723205902412607e+26,0.8530770114489964,0.8471928611397743,8.79500000000003,34.391111111111115,15.00032121695229,37.91919191919192,44.600863636363634,10.126202020202015,108.73737373737373,16.863636363636363,True,1151.0,0.8859688195991091,4.0632516703786195,2245.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036127167630057803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012463872832369943,0.002709537572254335,0.005148121387283237,0.0062360801781737195,13,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the wild vine. Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with an angler's immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love--and deem rich in beneficent influences--nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say: ""My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it could play the piano, I am sure it would really _play_."" And when she gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air. It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I would say to myself: ""Good heavens! nine o'clock! I must get ready for mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt Leonie first,"" and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise, cunning, and success. And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Theodore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of 'holy bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet cushion, against--as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words. Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on the right road' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart... On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray between Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation profits. More 'literary' than many 'men of letters' (we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead",4.070135150711002,1.4775365416671897,0.46467720826221615,0.06106174595739968,4.306361323155216,4.0,2.2533628229690876,65.5,52.5,49.13908831063108,1.2590330788804072,1.0,0.5913507902890701,1965,764,0.3888040712468193,8766,30,72.46061499143437,2.94608481826528e+31,1.312287224171617e+28,0.82793498758612,0.7989259931657996,33.838301526717586,24.811590330788807,13.5591,28.235623409669213,31.60296183206107,9.069496183206109,82.29389312977099,11.0,True,1211.0,0.8775055679287305,3.9046770601336305,2245.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013717805151175811,0.01101157148189623,0.0070921985815602835,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011198208286674132,0.005225830533781261,0.0,0.005345211581291759,14,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"is not that for which they are really fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we had never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavalliere neckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy, at fashionable life, and 'snobbishness'--""undoubtedly,"" he would say, ""the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness."" Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not having guillotined them all. ""Well met, my friends!"" he would say as he came towards us. ""You are lucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to squeeze back into my niche. ""Oh, I admit,"" he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical, disillusioned and vague, ""I have every useless thing in the world in my house there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch of open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life, little boy,"" he added, turning to me. ""You have a soul in you of rare quality, an artist's nature; never let it starve for lack of what it needs."" When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme. Goupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her. Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Francoise was at once dispatched to the grocer's, but returned empty-handed owing to the absence of Theodore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer's assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs. ""Ah!"" my aunt would sigh, ""I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She is really the only person who will be able to tell me."" Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had 'retired' after the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Theodore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt Leonie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Cure's linen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt Leonie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend Cure. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought, in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation and at Francoise's urgent request, and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid: ""Don't you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?"" or who, on the other hand, when she said to them: ""I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!"" had replied: ""Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may last a while yet""; each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again. And if Francoise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery. In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute: ""The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!"", twenty times Eulalie would retort with: ""Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday."" For one of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme. Sazerin. ""I do not ask to live to a hundred,"" my aunt would say, for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days. And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Francoise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But--and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray--the proud hour of noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us, Francoise would add--as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life--a brill, because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf, because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Francoise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: ""No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,"" would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played, and under the composer's very",3.8098985728507677,1.6880970364575536,0.43325626247213206,0.056119178680634034,4.301272264631043,4.0,2.2892209881284393,41.808510638297875,32.0,40.57388233296188,1.2860050890585242,1.0,0.619145409529975,1965,755,0.3842239185750636,8839,47,71.21025873734288,8.437667834705891e+30,3.660593420696699e+27,0.7881967167410514,0.7656860231525369,55.60333116777653,15.890179199826758,11.86871596605037,18.962590005955285,19.733247685561153,8.783491094147582,58.70418493855233,7.0638297872340425,True,1216.0,0.8590021691973969,3.83470715835141,2305.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009268699601445917,0.004819723792751877,0.004727036796737418,0.005639913232104121,15,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"eyes. At length my mother would say to me: ""Now, don't stay here all day; you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh air first; don't start reading immediately after your food."" And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender, allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the cave of Francoise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove. In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents', only yellow; then we would enter what he called his 'study,' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: ""A quarter past two,"" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing them: ""A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him...."" At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually. Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such strange titles as the _Testament de Cesar Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi_, inscribed not on the green bills of the Opera-Comique, but on the wine-coloured bills of the Comedie-Francaise, nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the _Diamants de la Couronne_ than the sleek, mysterious satin of the _Domino Noir_; and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between _rice a l'Imperatrice_ and the famous cream of chocolate. All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art, although as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and another's, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable. And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the master's head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second Delaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of budding and blossoming life. But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant, coming out one afternoon from the Theatre-Francais, had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a 'star,' blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life. I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who had perhaps never been married) and countesses (whose high-sounding titles were probably no more than _noms de guerre_) the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother: ""One of your uncle's friends,"" and I would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend. And so--on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been altered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my uncle--one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman's voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: ""Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother (your niece, isn't she?) beside it? The image of her, isn't he? I should so like to see the little chap, just for a second. I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant told me to come in. On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my uncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a young woman who",3.6253902816644032,1.4078664365191822,0.4405897884385052,0.06062557133720082,4.320142059868087,4.0,2.35109464884015,45.83720930232558,29.0,45.48597035558053,1.2749873160832066,1.0,0.6031192698964251,1971,752,0.3815322171486555,8869,43,72.66653611408574,3.6197256340640418e+31,1.5806662157484898e+28,0.7985182645775023,0.7825970409846887,52.44630561750027,17.331361957688816,12.266172071868077,20.567253076587264,21.836473753141483,8.956671740233382,63.29027881018961,8.0,True,1213.0,0.8663755458515284,3.8729257641921397,2290.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003882059340049912,0.003882059340049912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01109159811442832,0.00415934929291062,0.0,0.007423580786026201,16,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts. Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the discovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what Francoise would have called 'real people.' But none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple, of 'real' people would be a decided improvement. A 'real' person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The novelist's happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish, successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change. Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours. This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression--one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised--of their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and explored. Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments--which I isolate artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion--were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life. And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner which Francoise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface, and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours. Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming out ""They're coming, they're coming!"" so that Francoise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener's daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood. ""Poor children,"" Francoise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had reached the railings; ""poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow. It's just shocking to think of,"" she would go on, laying a hand over her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock. ""A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Francoise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?"" the gardener would ask, just to 'draw' her. And he would not have spoken in vain. ""Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that we should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a",3.936852304469293,1.1915635112813332,0.4323758014588493,0.054512817653034056,4.410178117048346,4.0,2.413426864514612,54.583333333333336,55.5,36.23179619554564,1.3048346055979643,1.0,0.645360845961121,1965,708,0.3603053435114504,8943,36,71.10885956521159,7.624042763428059e+30,3.424996749069209e+27,0.884266483783722,0.8805518430822036,41.043909033078904,21.094548346055984,13.98498818721588,24.479643765903308,26.633605597964383,9.589557251908396,73.61641221374046,10.38888888888889,True,1220.0,0.8867924528301887,4.017520215633423,2226.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.028458643165335536,0.009547415771596438,0.009547415771596438,0.009547415771596438,0.009547415771596438,0.009547415771596438,0.01101624896722666,0.002754062241806665,0.0,0.0026954177897574125,19,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and smiled; my uncle said ""My nephew!"" without telling her my name or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance. ""How like his mother he is,"" said the lady. ""But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,"" my uncle broke in quickly, with a note of anger. ""I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your staircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was. This young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,"" she went on, tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead. ""Tell me,"" she asked my uncle, ""is your niece Mme.----; is her name the same as yours?"" ""He takes most after his father,"" muttered my uncle, who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma's name aloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. ""He's his father all over, and also like my poor mother."" ""I have not met his father, dear,"" said the lady in pink, bowing her head slightly, ""and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another."" I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home, especially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every New Year's Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle's friend had the same quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner. I could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in photographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in believing that this was one of 'those women,' and certainly I should never have believed her one of the 'smart ones' had I not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who was no longer of a family at all. We had gone by this time into the 'study,' and my uncle, who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette. ""No, thank you, dear friend,"" she said. ""You know I only smoke the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous."" And she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a foreign language. ""Why, yes,"" she began again suddenly. ""Of course I have met this young man's father with you. Isn't he your nephew? How on earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,"" she went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming), I, who knew my father's coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality. It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up delicately, given it a 'turn,' a precious title, set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming. ""Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,"" said my uncle. I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to myself ""Shall I do it, shall I not?"" and then I ceased to ask myself what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me. ""Isn't he delicious! Quite a ladies' man already; he takes after his uncle. He'll be a perfect 'gentleman,'"" she went on, setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. ""Couldn't he come to me some day for 'a cup of tea,' as our friends across the channel say; he need only send me a 'blue' in the morning?"" I had not the least idea of what a 'blue' might be. I did not understand half the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was beginning to feel extremely tired. ""No, no; it is impossible,"" said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. ""He is kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all the prizes from his school,"" he added in a lower tone, so that I should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. ""You can't tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don't you know."" ""Oh, I love artistic people,"" replied the lady in pink; ""there is no one like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like yourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them."" My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old uncle's tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he, awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my uncle's I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle's conduct. My father and grandfather had 'words' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage, I felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him again. And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut) of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the back-kitchen until Francoise appeared on its threshold and announced: ""I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,"" I would then decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent",3.117939326093897,0.955169432415451,0.411849677184574,0.07954916072331086,4.152827305145186,4.0,2.327508512974911,26.89041095890411,18.0,24.431936007844048,1.2552215995924605,1.0,0.6035782157760816,1963,687,0.3499745287824758,8520,73,73.48178344759908,8.17961893677867e+31,3.5409605786920647e+28,0.747868348740869,0.729102503665736,73.3494855511902,9.708875149163639,10.299319088760253,13.099516395787829,11.575022086685877,7.517860417727963,42.122199038374305,4.095890410958904,True,1231.0,0.8562770562770563,3.688311688311688,2310.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01805157593123209,0.0028653295128939827,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012225405921680994,0.0028653295128939827,0.006112702960840497,0.0017316017316017316,17,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Francoise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: ""Well, how goes it with Giotto's Charity?"" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for it seems impossible that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The 'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious thoughts. Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures of Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that Charity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator's instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed), but as real things, actually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more literal to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal, intestinal aspect, towards that 'seamy side' of death which is, as it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a difficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of Death? There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and Vices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime face of true goodness. Then while the kitchen-maid--who, all unawares, made the superior qualities of Francoise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth--took in coffee which (according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Cure, by Camus (whom Francoise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and that he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies' music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie--born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible. This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which (thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it) bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life. But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had broken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up and beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I would go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little sentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family. And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange's, whose grocery lay too far from our house for Francoise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of",4.51371297890568,1.0993517153999868,0.4326830316593962,0.04165745633185112,4.439878234398782,4.0,2.4349086423912514,78.84,78.0,46.58813582877083,1.321664129883308,1.0,0.6742585012149799,1971,791,0.4013191273465246,9029,25,71.01421487320769,6.93556196317894e+30,3.0976158835100225e+27,0.9073327705264091,0.9130225570305534,14.999614611872161,30.75323673262304,16.69612070463519,34.397491628614915,38.901826484018265,9.931040081177066,99.03279553526129,15.92,True,1197.0,0.8834301027244306,4.032603841000447,2239.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009108297659167501,0.005829310501867201,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010383459331450951,0.003643319063667001,0.004371982876400401,0.003573023671281822,18,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same; it's quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those wretched wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing more nor less than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a rope to hang them with; they're not men any more, they're lions."" For by her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce 'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man. The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and Meseglise. Francoise and the gardener, having 'made up' their difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war. ""Don't you see, Francoise,"" he would say. ""Revolution would be better, because then no one would need to join in unless he liked."" ""Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward."" The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop all the railways. ""Yes, to be sure; so that we sha'n't get away,"" said Francoise. And the gardener would assent, with ""Ay, they're the cunning ones,"" for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so. But Francoise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Combray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule, 'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself has retreated. Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed. I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the _Nuit d'Octobre_, he had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of warning: ""You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,"" he added graciously, ""that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is _La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire_, and the other _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphae_. They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed _Bhagavat_ and the _Levrier de Magnus_ speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of Olympus. "" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me, ""my master. "" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name. Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have objected on principle--indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish extraction--had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfather's humming the ""O, God of our fathers"" from _La Juive_, or else ""Israel, break thy chain,"" singing the tune alone, of course, to an ""um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la""; but I used to be afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being able to reconstruct the words. Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family. ""And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?"" ""Dumont, grandpapa."" ""Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont."" And he would sing: Archers, be on your guard! Watch without rest, without sound, and then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call out ""On guard! on guard,"" or, if it were the victim himself who had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of What! do you hither guide the feet Of this timid Israelite? or of Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields, or, perhaps, of Yes, I am of the chosen race. These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest: ""Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'"" Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than ""Sir, I am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them."" ""My poor boy,"" said my father after Bloch had gone, ""your friend is out of his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile."" Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes. ""You cannot imagine that he is sincere,"" she observed to me. ""Why he doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course."" And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made not the least apology, saying merely: ""I never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the umbrella and the watch. In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in which she had left that",3.4953502059210053,1.308883533502356,0.3981914637917753,0.09894357636543769,4.275458248472505,4.0,2.334542817510618,30.6875,23.0,24.752446217495354,1.2703665987780042,1.0,0.6052365412800615,1964,756,0.384928716904277,8846,64,76.79069719549712,2.2375670264949736e+33,9.465173546933052e+29,0.7515099654122005,0.7117597558084996,68.21417324338087,11.368450865580453,10.820120047756994,14.637525458248474,14.0511583503055,8.375132382892055,47.64269348268839,5.203125,True,1231.0,0.8401015228426396,3.741962774957699,2364.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008799555390885514,0.0033345683586513525,0.0,0.006345177664974619,20,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"niece the whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the 'proper thing' to do. But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely meaningless' beauty of _La fille de Minos et de Pasiphae_ tired me more and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days, and had been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me with extreme coldness. But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly. For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment 'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would begin to speak of the ""vain dream of life,"" of the ""inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,"" of the ""sterile, splendid torture of understanding and loving,"" of the ""moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals""; that he would express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of Bergotte's works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the 'ideal passage' of Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged. I was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement, but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would seem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of _Notre-Dame de Paris_, of _Athalie_, or of _Phedre_, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother about Francoise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Francoise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father. From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my brain, with rather more _dolce_, rather more _lento_ than he himself had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called 'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come. One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted",4.0782572467918925,1.3544521904746762,0.42506267493187344,0.053882138031940585,4.30632008154944,4.0,2.430575458533907,54.5,47.5,42.48169540454388,1.2879714576962282,1.0,0.6410586803103434,1962,676,0.34454638124362896,8739,36,70.76653638716436,5.413975128958018e+30,2.4147971137190088e+27,0.8601832287652152,0.8466624407207265,42.555114678899116,20.863063200815493,13.858996823051623,24.389194699286445,26.10276758409786,8.978042813455655,72.7466870540265,9.944444444444445,True,1265.0,0.8795718108831401,3.8978590544157004,2242.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006081017868837122,0.002993731873889045,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009355412105903266,0.004490597810833568,0.0025259612685938817,0.010704727921498661,21,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"none too much shelter."" Suddenly my aunt turned pale. ""What, three o'clock!"" she exclaimed. ""But vespers will have begun already, and I've forgotten my pepsin! Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach."" And falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with gilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she swallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be able to overtake it and to 'send it down.' ""Three o'clock! It's unbelievable how time flies."" A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain. ""There, Francoise, what did I tell you? How it's coming down! But I think I heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside in this weather."" Francoise went and returned. ""It's Mme. Amedee"" (my grandmother). ""She said she was going for a walk. It's raining hard, all the same."" ""I'm not at all surprised,"" said my aunt, looking up towards the sky. ""I've always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well, I'm glad it's she and not myself who's outside in all this."" ""Mme. Amedee is always the exact opposite of the rest,"" said Francoise, not unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was 'a bit off her head. ""There's Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,"" sighed my aunt. ""It will be the weather that's frightened her away."" ""But it's not five o'clock yet, Mme. Octave, it's only half-past four."" ""Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small curtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a week before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Francoise, the dear Lord must be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking vengeance upon us."" A bright flush animated my aunt's cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck would have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when Francoise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings would give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was repeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use, said: ""His reverence the Cure would be delighted, enchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His reverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour."" Had the truth been known, the Cure's visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as Francoise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid. The Cure (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a great many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church (he had even planned to compile a history of the Parish of Combray), used to weary her with his endless explanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit synchronized exactly with Eulalie's it became frankly distasteful to my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not send the Cure away, and had to content herself with making a sign to Eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone. ""What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his easel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I can safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my life! What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing in the whole church, too."" ""I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for, although there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain details which are--well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don't talk to me about the windows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the Abbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know, of Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his Duchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married her cousin."" (My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in 'persons' had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must be related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral: ""I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it somewhere."" And for once I would side with the others, and against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school-friend and the descendant of Genevieve de Brabant.) ""Look at Roussainville,"" the Cure went on. ""It is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I am not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly like to think that the name was originally Rouville, from _Radulfi villa_, analogous, don't you see, to Chateauroux, _Castrum Radulfi_, but we will talk about that some other time.) Very well; the church there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing 'Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray' which would be more in keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the famous windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied's brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so extraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than the rest?"" ""I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,"" said my aunt in a resigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be 'tired,' ""he would never refuse you a new window."" ""You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,"" replied the Cure. ""Why, it was just his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct descendant of Genevieve de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire."" ""But I don't see where Saint Hilaire comes in."" ""Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a yellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will remember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint Helier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of _Sanctus Hilarius_ are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the case of your own patron, _Sancta Eulalia_; do you know what she has become in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a man of you!"" ""Father will always have his joke."" ""Gilbert's brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down, the original church, that was, which Theodebert, when he and his court left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of course, _Theodeberiacus_), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him victory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Theodore has probably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated the unlucky Charles with the aid of William"" which the Cure pronounced ""Will'am"" ""the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit the place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass, and cut off his head. Theodore has a little book, that he lends people, which tells you the whole story. ""But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you to climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at Milan.

"by Swann, who had come to call upon my parents. ""What are you reading? May I look? Why, it's Bergotte! Who has been telling you about him?"" I replied that Bloch was responsible. ""Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait of Mahomet II. It's an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a charming creature."" And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception in my favour and said: ""I know him well; if you would like him to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you."" I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about his friend. ""Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?"" ""Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you seen her?"" ""No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre."" ""That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in _Phedre_, in the _Cid_; well, she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't believe very much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts."" As he spoke I noticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say ""the 'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly people call it."" But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the 'hierarchy'? A moment later he went on: ""Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as--oh, I don't know--"" and he began to laugh, ""shall we say the Queens of Chartres?"" Until then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the 'lyrical' enthusiasms of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of 'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de Leon as being of no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer's admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and by Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: ""He has a charming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once."" But none of them had yet gone so far as to say ""He is a great writer, he has great talent."" They did not even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent. ""Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?"" I asked M. Swann. ""I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of print. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year's end to another. He is my daughter's greatest friend. They go about together, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles."" As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of Swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mlle. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt's conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth of a creature such as Mlle. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant, and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills and valleys of the Ile-de-France and of the plains of Normandy, would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of Mlle. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker. While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, ""How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn't Sunday, you know!"" putting into the word 'amusing' an implication of childishness and waste of time), my aunt Leonie would be gossiping with Francoise until it was time for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme. Goupil go by ""without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at Chateaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may get it properly soaked."" ""Very likely"" (which meant also ""very likely not"") was the answer, for Francoise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative. ""There, now,"" went on my aunt, beating her brow, ""that reminds me that I never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I must remember to ask Eulalie... Francoise, just look at that black cloud behind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be certain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn't possibly keep on like this, it's been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the storm breaks my Vichy water won't 'go down,'"" she concluded, since, in her mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil's new dress ruined. ""Very likely.""

"tiring enough for the most active person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don't wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,"" he went on, without noticing my aunt's fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, ""for there's a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-les-Combray, which are separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is _Gaudiacus vicecomitis_, as of course you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it's quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte."" The Cure had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away Eulalie also. ""Here, my poor Eulalie,"" she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand. ""This is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers."" ""Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don't think I ought to; you know very well that I don't come here for that!"" So Eulalie would answer, with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would remark afterwards, ""I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased."" ""I don't think she has very much to complain of, all the same,"" Francoise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so discreetly passed that Francoise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Cure, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed. Francoise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the 'same class' as my aunt, and who would naturally 'mix with her,' seemed to Francoise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Francoise would label ""people like myself,"" or ""people no better than myself,"" people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as ""Mme. Francoise,"" just to shew that they considered themselves to be 'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with both hands (or so, at least, Francoise believed) on undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such prosperity and importance that Francoise doubted Eulalie's ability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Francoise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Francoise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to 'look pleasant.' But she would make up for that after the other's departure; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like those of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her; ""Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and one fine day He will be avenged upon them!"" she would declaim, with the sidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he says that the prosperity Of wicked men runs like a torrent past, And soon is spent. But on this memorable afternoon, when the Cure had come as well, and by his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength, Francoise followed Eulalie from the room, saying: ""Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you look utterly tired out."" And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though already dead. But hardly had Francoise arrived downstairs, when four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: ""Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!"" But Francoise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. ""It is most provoking,"" said my aunt, shaking her head. ""The one important thing that I had to ask her."" In this way life went by for my aunt Leonie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' Respected by all and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing-case would send first to Francoise to make sure that my aunt was not 'resting'--her 'little jog-trot' was, none the less, brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid's confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in Combray, Francoise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to 'rest,' owing to the cries of the girl, and as Francoise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning, my mother said to me: ""Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything."" I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing, in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her sleep, and made it 'change speed,' as they say of motorcars nowadays, for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: ""The Lord be praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid's baby. And I've been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take a walk every day!"" She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented,",3.6638881461721935,1.1618037606018456,0.40430460179067224,0.06654938904588906,4.28498985801217,4.0,2.228552921433411,34.0,26.0,24.86446016527093,1.2459432048681542,1.0,0.57664024172507,1972,704,0.35699797160243407,8859,58,74.50495547630477,2.275574391909223e+32,9.695672739280882e+28,0.7976813332030648,0.8100571089557239,66.91820486815418,12.372129817444222,10.440368640799012,15.526977687626776,15.752302231237323,8.525152129817442,51.139959432048684,5.827586206896552,True,1230.0,0.847890924584576,3.7746058798466127,2347.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018225552780090665,0.009344065130909428,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012489592006661115,0.004163197335553705,0.0022203719122953097,0.004686834256497656,24,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone's else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and heard. When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as Francoise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin, the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so well 'routined' to it, as Francoise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have 'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, ""Hurry up; there's no time to be lost; don't forget, it's Saturday!"" while my aunt, gossiping with Francoise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, ""You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it's Saturday."" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, ""I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,"" everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: ""Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's Saturday?"" And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt Leonie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for our walk, said, ""What, only two o'clock!"" feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would respond in chorus: ""Why, you're forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very well it's Saturday."" The surprise of a 'barbarian' (for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with Saturday's special customs) who had called at eleven o'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event which used to cause Francoise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: ""You see, it's Saturday."" On reaching this point in the story, Francoise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: ""Oh, but surely he said something else as well. There was more than that, the first time you told it."" My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses. The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the 'Month of Mary' devotions. As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views on ""the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be encouraged in these days,"" my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the church. It was in these 'Month of Mary' services that I can remember having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive. M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us. He belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my grandmother's sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used often to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what he called ""a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these days."" My mother, on hearing that he 'composed,' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil's house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: ""I cannot think who put that on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,"" and had turned the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less interest to himself. His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the 'good sort' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears. When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mlle. Vinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers. Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil, in the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he would interfere, taking the side of the little",3.708016085688413,1.005365186460138,0.4240828770168405,0.05052702072171683,4.390973630831643,4.0,2.4024116655277243,41.95744680851064,35.0,23.53445409716202,1.3078093306288032,1.0,0.6449050342484105,1972,751,0.3808316430020284,9036,47,74.49824258247843,2.2603498601268967e+32,9.742887328133176e+28,0.8626783995524697,0.8596239076720343,53.607522118164965,16.20555435673903,12.295286554802754,19.23733977817099,20.230209205472356,9.313448275862065,60.77083423244573,7.8936170212765955,True,1234.0,0.8573275862068965,3.8948275862068966,2320.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006826870562534134,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009102494083378846,0.00591662115419625,0.006553795740032769,0.00646551724137931,25,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"who had given it to her."" So on by degrees, until Francoise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My mother was afraid lest Francoise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that might be, Francoise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this way--whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms--a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features would provide Francoise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles. One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Cure and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time. ""I hear that things went wrong again to-day, Leonie,"" she said kindly, ""you have had all your friends here at once."" And my great-aunt interrupted with: ""Too many good things..."" for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak. ""I should like to take advantage,"" he said, ""of the whole family's being here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning."" I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner, which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity. As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions. Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend. ""I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,"" he said, ""because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties, so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost, which is really attractive."" But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question, had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: ""Do you know, master book-lover,"" he asked me, ""this line of Paul Desjardins? Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue. Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the most charming water-colour touch-- Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue. May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself, as I am doing, by looking up to the sky. "" He took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. ""Goodbye, friends!"" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us. At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Francoise, a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter's craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played (lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's _Dream_) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume. Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Francoise with the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And, meanwhile, Francoise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues. But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Francoise, being without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Francoise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of ""Filthy creature! Filthy creature!"" it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead Francoise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final ""Filthy creature!"" I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Francoise. But who would have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even--roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt Leonie knew (though I was still in ignorance of this) that Francoise, who, for her own daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise that Francoise's kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues concealed",3.7929671519097243,1.2764378849351616,0.41153231788681427,0.05663609819651062,4.414931437277806,4.0,2.3439624544094286,42.80434782608695,26.5,44.927777582334436,1.2940578974098527,1.0,0.6116942632650513,1969,762,0.38699847638395124,9043,46,71.40339426228783,1.0235289177155192e+31,4.4539987716080037e+27,0.7861671540472243,0.7700507932088592,53.91128883564822,16.373578841610172,12.122386844133771,19.437635524543467,20.76650098262194,9.468278313864904,62.001910040408944,8.217391304347826,True,1178.0,0.8629242819843342,3.9351610095735423,2298.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01528245246975348,0.012371509142181387,0.010006367688529064,0.010006367688529064,0.010006367688529064,0.010006367688529064,0.009551532793595925,0.0021832074956790685,0.0,0.006527415143603133,27,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"ones and lecturing the big. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless, schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother's utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the evenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray were constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must have taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon. Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother--""Where are we?"" Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly ""You really are wonderful!"" And from that instant I had not to take another step; the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my will. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my bed, and laid me down there like a little child. Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of the services of Francoise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when those people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news), for some emotion (even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which prosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of course, since my aunt's strength, which was completely drained by the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities, but which she had no idea--and could never decide how to employ. And I have no doubt that then--just as a desire to have her potatoes served with bechamel sauce, for a change, would be formed, ultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never 'tired'--she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much depended) a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she felt 'well' and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already perished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone standing upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience (and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that Francoise had been robbing her, that she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by herself, of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once, she would first stammer out Francoise's awkward apologies, and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows. Francoise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Francoise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would confide in Francoise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was Francoise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her by Francoise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Francoise's features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Francoise turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie--like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths--proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. ""But Francoise ought to know that,"" said Eulalie, ""now that you have given her a carriage."" ""Now that I have given her a carriage!"" gasped my aunt. ""Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I supposed that it must be Mme. Octave",3.7586455920955606,1.4141646417203502,0.39560100217734123,0.08591338695608235,4.45010183299389,4.0,2.382055922376428,49.1,35.0,42.79240586833136,1.2922606924643585,1.0,0.6246148966416417,1964,775,0.39460285132382894,9057,40,67.82473185042672,2.8569772308028377e+29,1.2658295218444119e+26,0.8165502154674286,0.8149935277669054,47.67324541751529,18.807676171079432,12.730933301510706,21.941425661914465,24.079979633401223,9.76374745417515,68.04093686354379,9.3,True,1222.0,0.874612317235268,4.012848914488258,2257.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012174071045698192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007722358499136913,0.005996184246388662,0.0,0.005316792202038104,26,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Francoise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent Francoise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour elapsed, and Francoise had not returned; my mother, supposing that she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Francoise who, in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: ""Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!"" But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto's Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot: ""Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after _that_. Dear, dear, it's just as they used to say in my poor mother's country: Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs' tails, And dirty sluts in plenty, Smell sweeter than roses in young men's noses When the heart is one-and-twenty. Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would set off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress's presence. There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions) depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the same way Francoise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt's service. Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one of the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world, something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that Mme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when I arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed on their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen me come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the market, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the 'Saint-Honore,' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice. Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same Sunday evening. ""Come and bear your aged friend company,"" he had said to me. ""Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with the primrose, with the canon's beard, with the gold-cup; come with the stone-crop, whereof are posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian flora, come with that flower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter daisy, come with the snowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great-aunt's garden ere the last snows of Lent are melted from its soil. Come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily, apparel fit for Solomon, and with the many-coloured enamel of the pansies, but come, above all, with the spring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of winter, wafting apart, for the two butterflies' sake, that have waited outside all morning, the closed portals of the first Jerusalem rose."" The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought still to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin.

"""You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion."" She added that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing. And indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals a man's deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes, and these alone are of importance in indicating character, are the most apt to leave us in perplexity. I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. ""There is a charming quality, is there not,"" he said to me, ""in this silence; for hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence."" I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said, it sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my courage and said to him: ""Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the lady--the ladies of Guermantes?"" and I felt glad because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things. But, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of our friend's blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils, reacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow. His fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows. ""No, I do not know them,"" he said, but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society. ""No,"" he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered. ""No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I have always made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart, as you know, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me about it, telling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I make myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that's not the sort of reputation that can frighten me; it's too true! In my heart of hearts I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches, books--two or three, pictures--rather more, perhaps, and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth (such as yours) wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough, now, to distinguish. I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to cling to one's independence, nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among his friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment should go against him (if so it must) by default: in a word, he was a snob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked him, ""Do you know the Guermantes family?"" Legrandin the talker would reply, ""No, I have never cared to know them."" But unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because this other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this other Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of snobbery: ""Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life."" And since this other, this irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our Legrandin's charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself, by means of what are called 'reflexes,' it followed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his _alter ego_ must have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them. This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least) be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin's snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin's eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause. At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he found it difficult to take Legrandin's airs in so light, in so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: ""I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister. He probably doesn't remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place."" My grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought to be on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and that one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights, to the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our plans; for already, in her mind's eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when we met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne. ""There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?"" he said to my father. ""Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of the Auge Valley, those",3.7662347174767605,1.177290760544602,0.4205225847578579,0.06623814670523355,4.393476044852192,4.0,2.4195765980960555,41.744680851063826,29.0,36.67712376777747,1.3144750254841997,1.0,0.6731219992919634,1962,707,0.36034658511722734,8965,47,74.4667816753396,2.1903441980324274e+32,9.56064687050383e+28,0.8340009114016658,0.8190931850009494,53.25956178020695,16.20123083262845,13.603388946566742,19.91907519465591,20.13561259678574,9.324566768603464,61.11267269611989,8.085106382978724,True,1250.0,0.8616324749017896,3.9131383675250984,2291.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008428767750801648,0.006138341731562071,0.004580852038479157,0.004580852038479157,0.004580852038479157,0.0,0.007329363261566651,0.0014658726523133303,0.0016491067338524966,0.013094718463553033,29,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"only to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special excellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first stages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever upon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day, or in the course of the same walk, but the 'Meseglise way' one time and the 'Guermantes way' another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart and unaware of each other's existence, in the sealed vessels--between which there could be no communication--of separate afternoons. When we had decided to go the 'Meseglise way' we would start (without undue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was not very long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were not going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt's house, which opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell Theodore, from Francoise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil or coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of M. Swann's park. Before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers. Out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which they had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little tiled house, called the Archers' Lodge, in which Swann's keeper lived, overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann's marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we would, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in the same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far from home. One day my grandfather said to my 'father: ""Don't you remember Swann's telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in Paris? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home; that will make it a little shorter."" We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some of the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny balls of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only a week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry and scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day of his wife's death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once again, the story of that walk. In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away into the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it, an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by Swann's parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid-out' scenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human interference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and superimposing itself upon the work of man's hands. And so it was that, at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there might be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below and of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland which binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the iris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out over agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake. The absence of Mlle. Swann, which--since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals--made the exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my grandfather's and father's eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting--when I was obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves' in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind. But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to marshal before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which",3.9560792592203624,1.2449034095169902,0.44088916863134997,0.05778481898970209,4.417638114546376,4.0,2.3411376705146973,58.029411764705884,53.0,39.43608775349094,1.2747085656360873,1.0,0.6372091159010121,1973,765,0.3877344145970603,9013,34,71.80458279266753,1.5287415947001072e+31,6.788372978242039e+27,0.8708689628225385,0.8507263632491231,40.09480240601056,22.083031662741124,13.994808079035785,25.705429176232077,28.391781401866375,9.665625950329446,75.26205241346412,10.0,True,1192.0,0.8814387211367674,4.002220248667851,2252.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0034662045060658577,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01149320441484995,0.003648636322174587,0.0,0.003996447602131439,31,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am very far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil, the true Armor, the sea, the land's end, the accursed region which Anatole France--an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read--has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing. ""Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?"" inquired my father. ""This young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother, and my wife too, perhaps."" Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity--smiling mournfully the while--upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed to have penetrated my father's skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable him to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask, ""Why, what are you thinking about?"" But my father, inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: ""Have you friends, then, in that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?"" In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction; then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to answer, he said to us: ""I have friends all the world over, wherever there are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come together to offer a common supplication, with pathetic obstinacy, to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them."" ""That is not quite what I meant,"" interrupted my father, obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky. ""I asked you, in case anything should happen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the people."" ""There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,"" replied Legrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; ""places I know well, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff's edge; standing there by the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if anything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows not truth,"" he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, ""that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,"" he went on with emphasis, ""the waters of that bay--more Breton than Norman--may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken, a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at your age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated.... Good night to you, neighbours,"" he added, moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed; and then, turning towards us, with a physicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: ""No Balbec before you are fifty!"" he called out to me, ""and even then it must depend on the state of the heart."" My father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured him with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative--but an honourable occupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own sister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain--as, from his knowledge of my grandmother's character, he really ought to have been certain--that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it. * * * We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt Leonie a visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt Leonie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water's surface, would be lying across it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: ""Good heavens! There is Francoise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious; that means we are late."" And without wasting time by stopping to take off our 'things' we would fly upstairs to my aunt Leonie's room to reassure her, to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that, on the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the 'Guermantes way,' and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home. ""There, Francoise,"" my aunt would say, ""didn't I tell you that they must have gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours it's been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the Guermantes way?"" ""But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,"" Mamma would answer. ""I thought that Francoise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the kitchen-garden."" For there were, in the environs of Combray, two 'ways' which we used to take for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen: the way towards Meseglise-la-Vineuse, which we called also 'Swann's way,' because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M. Swann's estate, and the 'Guermantes way.' Of Meseglise-la-Vineuse, to tell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and the strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in Combray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would 'know at all,' and whom we would therefore assume to be 'people who must have come over from Meseglise.' As for Guermantes, I was to know it well enough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole of my boyhood, if Meseglise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than the ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the 'Guermantes way,' a sort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator. And so to 'take the Guermantes way' in order to get to Meseglise, or vice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always to speak of the 'Meseglise way' as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere, and of the 'Guermantes way' as typical of river scenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs",3.4817658406697425,1.6109691701243796,0.40262109205469887,0.11674264855450156,4.404749873673572,4.0,2.3426527496841185,41.229166666666664,30.5,37.7156242951409,1.2945932289034867,1.0,0.6161266101802796,1979,771,0.3895907023749368,9122,48,75.63030700251942,7.011726955588831e+32,2.969812348830509e+29,0.7292466761663239,0.6533919688233215,55.464808668098385,15.765575101061142,12.124030204009365,18.896921846050194,19.930955238335862,9.381990904497219,58.611683089102236,7.166666666666667,True,1199.0,0.8424396442185514,3.863617111393477,2361.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.020682803468208093,0.015534682080924855,0.007947976878612716,0.007947976878612716,0.007947976878612716,0.007947976878612716,0.008128612716763005,0.002890173410404624,0.006864161849710983,0.010588733587462939,30,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elysees, where she lived in Paris. ""Leonie,"" said my grandfather on our return, ""I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much."" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk, either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover, Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, ""Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park."" And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired' again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her--and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us--was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement 'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose. My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying to make them speak of Mlle. Swann's parents and grandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann--when I talked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather's business had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt Leonie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: ""No, no, the business belonged to _Swann's_ father, that hedge is part of _Swann's_ park."" And then I would be obliged to pause for breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts. That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my hair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville, bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and (like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her. ""Oh, my poor little hawthorns,"" I was assuring them through my sobs, ""it is not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you. You, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you."" And, drying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom. Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our Meseglise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had the wind for companion when one went the 'Meseglise way,' on that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu (_Campus Pagani_, according to the Cure). On my right I could see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of Saint-Andre-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated, honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat. At regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the apple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging in shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going the 'Meseglise way' that I first noticed the circular shadow which apple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path. Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of art were very different--at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies--from those in which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have recognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine, some landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it enraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire. They held that one ought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one's heart. It was along the 'Meseglise way,' at Montjouvain, a house built on the edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet",3.5923390330524065,1.204141819820576,0.4107275303849234,0.07101850746177338,4.28978139298424,4.0,2.3080972611556554,42.76086956521739,34.5,36.16098352753474,1.260803253685816,1.0,0.5919335463237702,1967,714,0.36298932384341637,8746,46,71.97936368623324,1.8207086681731366e+31,8.045553107260878e+27,0.8186854302883149,0.8088539645753123,56.768762129484315,15.964217523927413,12.122386844133771,19.422598969960877,20.15530514356447,8.731692933401117,59.84272009902522,7.304347826086956,True,1248.0,0.8722934158197083,3.864781263809103,2263.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0037397157816005983,0.0037397157816005983,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009349289454001496,0.002243829468960359,0.005048616305160808,0.007512152010605391,33,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"it sprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer's when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of it, ""The Sea!"" And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: ""You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn't it pretty?"" And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion, because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially festal--but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,' and consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of Combray, to the 'plain,' if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the 'stores' in the Square, or at Camus's, where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one's costume for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints, even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too ravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches, like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler in colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed already to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful. The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough 'power of observation' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so black--which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her--I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined blue. I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate insult. ""Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?"" called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen 'ducks,' whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded, and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly. And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity--so exquisitely painful to myself--with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never penetrate. For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: ""Poor Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her Charlus--for that was Charlus: I recognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!"") the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte's mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout, ""I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!"" However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to conquer, to cover,",4.594641883513655,1.0332096000073,0.42155136018093353,0.047735485998299965,4.352313167259786,4.0,2.376897681913164,70.25,63.0,42.03113216924535,1.2892730045754957,1.0,0.6466069039644335,1967,746,0.3792577529232333,8894,28,73.25002387897177,6.487556750720694e+31,2.8391933263547897e+28,0.895352096469314,0.8943647948595194,26.458753812913073,27.020921453990848,15.903189008614273,30.946975088967974,34.19439501779359,9.370249110320284,88.80617691916623,13.035714285714286,True,1225.0,0.8643326039387309,3.8923413566739606,2285.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009590556990040576,0.004795278495020288,0.004795278495020288,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00968277388417558,0.002950940612320177,0.0,0.001312910284463895,32,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: ""That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about, and to let his daughter--a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense--bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold, and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter."" But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the part of 'double-dealer,' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Cure and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice: ""What d'ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with her friend, Mlle. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too, with his daughter's friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say they've been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his feet."" Anyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time, avoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a sea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughter's happiness, spending whole days beside his wife's grave, could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed, what his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil's sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of its physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in 'low,' in the very 'lowest water,' inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they might hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune. One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of Combray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and Swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who, amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another's shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil, with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day, to play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier, would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting. Swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve. ""What a charming man!"" he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. ""What a charming man! What a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!"" And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann's marriage, invoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit Swann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly, after meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself, one of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil should appear with his daughter at Tansonville. Since the 'Meseglise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of Meseglise shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the fringe of Roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves. Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its roundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness, though not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village of Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from its perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses. But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the trees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last drops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we would emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now, among the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a stray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree. Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-Andre-des-Champs. How typically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of Francoise. The sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil, precisely as Francoise in her kitchen would break into speech about Saint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to depreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered less 'righteous.' One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant (who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century) had of classical and of early Christian history, ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were derived not from books,",3.296833109104211,1.1923495022324635,0.43581881899572633,0.07283205634286369,4.437244897959184,4.0,2.3493682523016584,36.2962962962963,27.0,33.420236511802266,1.3168367346938776,1.0,0.6437471568215802,1960,753,0.38418367346938775,8975,54,66.30973573727397,6.27989420148365e+28,2.8262350141690596e+25,0.784140150502043,0.787079489001861,58.589871504157216,14.104229024943312,11.89002406972892,17.110355253212397,17.61757161753591,9.475489795918367,56.04119425547997,7.166666666666667,True,1214.0,0.8870387038703871,4.039153915391539,2222.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004210526315789474,0.004210526315789474,0.004210526315789474,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008237986270022883,0.005491990846681922,0.0,0.0144014401440144,34,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"but from a tradition at once ancient and direct, unbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray person whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic sculptures of Saint-Andre-des-Champs was young Theodore, the assistant in Camus's shop. And, indeed, Francoise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill for Francoise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs and, perhaps, 'make an impression' on my aunt, she would send out for Theodore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a 'bad character,' was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of Saint-Andre-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due, in Francoise eyes, to all 'poor invalids,' and, above all, to her own 'poor mistress,' that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt's head from her pillow, the same air of preraphaelite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of Theodore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples. There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there--as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone--seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar. Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in a landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere, resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the fluid and unstable 'fine weather' of winter, its very opposite, in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white. Sitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner with a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather's continuing; it might rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville, there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees. If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of a walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit of going out by myself on such days, and walking towards Meseglise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray to settle the division of my aunt Leonie's estate; for she had died at last, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise--those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary, but organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it; causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that one a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my aunt's last illness Francoise never went out of her room for an instant, never took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave. Then, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Francoise had lived of my aunt's harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which was really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The time had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Francoise eyes, with my aunt. During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with solicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it happened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them, along the 'Meseglise way,' wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which protected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised Francoise, whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of one's clothes had nothing whatever to do with one's mourning for the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt's death was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I am sure that in a book--and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of Francoise--such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the _Chanson de Roland_ and of the porch of Saint-Andre-des-Champs, would have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Francoise herself approached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry, and I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I regretted my aunt's death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moment's sorrow; statements which, in a book, would have struck me as merely fatuous. And if Francoise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: ""I don't know how to _espress_ myself""--I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: ""All the same she was a _geological_ relation; there is always the respect due to your _geology_,"" I would shrug my shoulders and say: ""It is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language,"" adopting, to deliver judgment on Francoise, the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life. My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used to take them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of reading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was now obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in every direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its back, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must hear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day, rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation, found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet. And so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted. When I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the 'Meseglise way,' all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression. After an hour of rain and",4.3432406477641,1.4900655857843832,0.42638881648827015,0.04507902109855981,4.418181818181818,4.0,2.3685380410267074,68.27586206896552,59.0,47.513988177511465,1.2969696969696969,1.0,0.6393580343214773,1980,780,0.3939393939393939,9076,29,73.35061445390264,7.174094639868169e+31,3.1327924191564057e+28,0.8508392285023417,0.8639915453063117,27.81136363636368,26.341828631138984,15.036891161455074,29.855799373040753,33.51756739811912,9.745373737373733,86.45768025078371,12.413793103448276,True,1186.0,0.8698689956331878,3.963318777292576,2290.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025303827317250137,0.018411028478142574,0.008797387992018865,0.008797387992018865,0.006530019952838745,0.006530019952838745,0.008162524941048431,0.0043533466352258295,0.003809178305822601,0.008733624454148471,35,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"wind, against which I had put up a brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil's gardener kept his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall, and the chicken's downy feathers, both of which things let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent, with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never observed before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the wall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: ""Damn, damn, damn, damn!"" But at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment. And it was at that moment, too--thanks to a peasant who went past, apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality to my ""Fine day, what! good to be out walking!""--that I learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that, whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them with a kiss. Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in the woman's charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any bounds. Moreover--just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be--the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of 'woman,' but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from Meseglise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for Balbec and Meseglise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from Meseglise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon us. Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville, that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village, appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my earliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from the little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen nothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window, while, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of my own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even--until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I might go alone as far as the porch of Saint-Andre-des-Champs: never did I find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with my grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix my eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time. And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at Montjouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel side of human passion called 'sadism.' We shall see, in due course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the",3.820925402021724,0.9604868394002433,0.4400345744752956,0.05042205995415324,4.319634703196347,4.0,2.3970036827236028,50.53846153846154,41.0,35.845713654169664,1.2871638762049722,1.0,0.6328826587130015,1971,699,0.3546423135464231,8764,39,72.43274572447703,2.865113145367045e+31,1.2952591073087906e+28,0.8727006614208221,0.87366257326023,46.6443976115209,19.308533739218678,13.315564473090674,22.731873707216174,24.184710221285563,9.013759512937593,67.48417437458534,8.564102564102564,True,1252.0,0.8933092224231465,3.962025316455696,2212.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.018760500280007468,0.010080268807168192,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008400224005973492,0.00513347022587269,0.0052268060481612845,0.009945750452079566,36,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mlle. Vinteuil (or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her. She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence--namely, modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My mother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, his complete absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old man's face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father. ""Poor M. Vinteuil,"" my mother would say, ""he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only come to him from her."" At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece, stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch, just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside, then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' But no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding. ""Leave them open,"" said her friend. ""I am hot."" ""But it's too dreadful! People will see us,"" Mlle. Vinteuil answered. And then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful, when she hastily went on: ""When I say 'see us' I mean, of course, see us reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you."" With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire. ""Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district!"" said her friend, with bitter irony. ""And what if they are?"" she went on, feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. ""And what if they are? All the better that they should see us."" Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself with: ""You're sure you aren't cold? You aren't too hot? You don't want to sit and read by yourself? ""Your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening,"" she concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some earlier occasion, by her friend. In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time: ""Oh! there's my father's picture looking at us; I can't think who can have put it there; I'm sure I've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it."" I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response: ""Let him stay there. He can't trouble us any longer. D'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?"" To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, ""Oh, please!""--a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl's head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan. ""Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?"" she said, taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something that I could not distinguish. ""Oh! You would never dare."" ""Not dare to spit on it? On that?"" shouted the friend with deliberate brutality. I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward, preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on account of his daughter, had received from her after his death. And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his",2.9950417789831754,1.4071238133020982,0.41337441546503234,0.07779374365877732,4.358201328564129,4.0,2.2762577726300317,27.957142857142856,20.5,34.05559979725831,1.2657128257537047,1.0,0.5945714784861142,1957,677,0.34593765968318857,8908,70,69.49281837383342,1.514772986761783e+30,6.591701421939874e+26,0.7057033086168594,0.6592082067337983,71.3791949412366,10.248697058179427,10.322884191925693,13.451635885831081,13.075699686108472,8.767460398569241,44.8707861887729,4.728571428571429,True,1216.0,0.8620539599651871,3.876414273281114,2298.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011051759071652238,0.004420703628660895,0.004420703628660895,0.004420703628660895,0.0,0.0,0.006907349419782649,0.018051206483698654,0.004420703628660895,0.011314186248912098,37,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"daughter's soundness of heart, and that he might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle. Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty. If the 'Meseglise way' was so easy, it was a very different matter when we took the 'Guermantes way,' for that meant a long walk, and we must make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days, when Francoise, in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the 'poor crops,' gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: ""You would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!""--when my father's appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner: ""To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way."" And off we would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing, I pierce through it and 'restore' the Rue des Perchamps. And for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it has preserved--perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon to follow the rest into oblivion--of what Combray looked like in my childhood's days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as moving--if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works, reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me--as those old engravings of the 'Cenacolo,' or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark's. We would pass, in the Rue de l'Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesche, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would rumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes, and de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some litigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would come at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the steeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for it was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that it relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the indolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do, had simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed, at a given moment, the distended surface of the silence. The great charm of the 'Guermantes' way was that we had beside us, almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux. And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform or chorister's surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt, fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers' school, who came there in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a",3.655775340377362,1.0934863792019975,0.43683845690544043,0.06625170607313494,4.431749241658241,4.0,2.3632771615229275,46.0,38.0,32.60617718619701,1.2962588473205259,1.0,0.62570175586723,1978,752,0.38018200202224467,9107,43,73.49353790972596,8.276333256627067e+31,3.615698233563594e+28,0.845973252540543,0.8385867091213784,50.48150151668352,17.64585439838221,12.791016139584947,20.887360970677452,22.443538928210316,9.615207280080892,64.80687563195147,8.651162790697674,True,1215.0,0.8702490170380078,3.978593272171254,2289.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004522022248349462,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008139640047029032,0.007596997377227096,0.004341141358415484,0.011358671909130624,38,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"past that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water's edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name--a name fit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine and the water's edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the golden East. I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water and 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation. Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants. At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current, across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt Leonie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange, ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents. But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonne. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals. Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery--with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky. After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly. How often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free to live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it drift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace. We would sit down among the irises at the water's edge. In the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed by the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with an anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet. Sometimes, at the water's edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon a house of the kind called 'pleasure houses,' isolated and lost, seeing nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, 'to bury herself,' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had been unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard, through the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom, before they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they known, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And I watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious, useless charm. Never, in the course of our walks along the 'Guermantes way,' might we penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often thought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from Combray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earth's surface, where, according to the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that other goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I knew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually exist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself either in tapestry, as was the 'Coronation of Esther' which hung in our church, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in his window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row of chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Genevieve de Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling--in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age, and bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable 'antes.' And if, in spite of that, they were for me, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes of which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit 'Guermantes way' of our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords",4.3058956940091955,1.5288422780190367,0.42831775423649043,0.04418871266497678,4.551724137931035,4.0,2.3767514240256657,61.625,56.5,47.72823456823016,1.308316430020284,1.0,0.6419037080904562,1972,802,0.4066937119675456,9287,32,74.00538968801823,1.3808050687351914e+32,6.069472829605237e+28,0.8741990308607778,0.8722597221533458,33.602055020283984,23.881883874239353,14.237784482759423,27.104361054766738,30.821120689655174,10.483813387423936,81.40187626774848,12.1875,True,1148.0,0.869010989010989,4.082197802197802,2275.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013348758565453412,0.005517486873720744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008543205481890184,0.003915635845866334,0.005695470321260123,0.003076923076923077,39,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it--Comtes de Combray, possessing Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors of the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling, presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the 'other side' in dull black lacquer, if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus's for a packet of salt. And then it happened that, going the 'Guermantes way,' I passed occasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I heard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father's arranging everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who 'really counted,' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which Francoise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat's son, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began with 'A,' instead of having to wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my father's understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience. One day my mother said: ""You are always talking about Mme. de Guermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter's wedding. You will be able to see her in church."" It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de Leon. Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side, enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:--_a large nose, blue eyes_, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: ""This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes."" Now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and tradesmen. ""It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!"" were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern. Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent nose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision (perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the first impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de Guermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: ""It is Mme. de Guermantes""; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me: ""Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Genevieve de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day."" And then--oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as far as it may choose--while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there",4.013773926772657,1.3905983965423527,0.4291167332017255,0.0429994885505541,4.396120469627361,4.0,2.489857990006205,59.36363636363637,50.0,48.4210185903014,1.3149566105155692,1.0,0.649604965486906,1959,725,0.37008677896886166,8920,33,75.03649199063636,3.871991657446464e+32,1.7140290648280053e+29,0.8283902797847986,0.8387233980240361,35.33557984129196,23.078306185901898,14.11328607072748,26.236521416307024,28.95754559376305,9.550566615620212,78.45500951320247,11.333333333333334,True,1189.0,0.869411243913236,3.9486498450641876,2259.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02842686292548298,0.011039558417663294,0.0068077276908923645,0.0068077276908923645,0.0,0.0,0.020331186752529897,0.0077276908923643054,0.019871205151793928,0.00619743249225321,40,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart. I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before I had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for years past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later reference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious, authentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now that, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face--and especially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived--I found only beauty there; setting her once again (since they were one and the same person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape) apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation round me: ""She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat"" or ""than Mlle. Vinteuil,"" as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: ""How lovely she is! What true nobility! it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Genevieve de Brabant, that I have before me!"" And the care which I took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her, and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all those Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in return, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs, in a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in any way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see again to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle astonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to address it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves. This smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, ""Of course, she is thinking about me."" I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would, perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account. And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours, it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet dedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the Square and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly advanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a bloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages of _Lohengrin_, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand how Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet 'delicious. How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the 'Guermantes way,' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour--to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side. In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once to contain",4.238660586771667,1.1799505866617042,0.4398603207854156,0.03918134360168149,4.306986231514533,4.0,2.4063482979124227,61.28125,57.5,31.71182190347158,1.3069862315145333,1.0,0.6486931469443236,1961,734,0.3742988271290158,8716,32,74.32081777656165,1.8928711450835587e+32,8.495830992296044e+28,0.8971546253850383,0.8788184404373169,34.0634960638705,23.732125031871494,14.329215526747927,27.021424018357983,29.49653015043345,9.042060173380925,79.02729793472719,10.875,True,1231.0,0.88016157989228,3.912028725314183,2228.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010688168010500656,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007969248078004875,0.004687792987061692,0.006750421901368836,0.0026929982046678637,41,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"and to conceal. The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more. Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there. Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church. We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and resigned, and so vanishing in the night. I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor's coachman was in the habit of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice. All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de Guermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the Vivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in such moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the 'Guermantes way' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of happiness--I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my mother's face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it was from the 'Guermantes way' that I learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other. So the 'Meseglise way' and the 'Guermantes way' remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of the mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have opened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for their discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us those truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became apparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water which rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming child--as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd--that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current, and formed only to burst--my exaltation of mind has borne them with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all these successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have vanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from what place, from what time--perhaps, quite simply, from which of my dreams--it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil, as firm sites on which I still",4.034762614212245,1.0609025047209153,0.4487913429180699,0.04762689553766565,4.300965937976614,4.0,2.283628896697791,56.2,45.0,40.04055087390425,1.2414844941535332,1.0,0.5651706174071797,1967,681,0.3462125063548551,8750,35,74.99824750099114,3.7267052234172246e+32,1.657049899251767e+29,0.9121579527854919,0.9089871374043551,44.7624117946111,20.977517031011697,12.441301995231846,24.371204880528726,26.927549567869853,8.96298932384342,73.07849517031012,9.485714285714286,True,1233.0,0.8755002223210315,3.8906180524677634,2249.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015514018691588785,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011682242990654205,0.00411214953271028,0.0053271028037383174,0.0035571365051133837,42,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"may build, that I regard the Meseglise and Guermantes 'ways.' It is because I used to think of certain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that the things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone, I still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers. The 'Meseglise way' with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple-trees, the 'Guermantes way' with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my only requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat, see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among the cornfields--as Saint-Andre-des-Champs lay hidden--an old church, monumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to encounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on the level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And yet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am seized with a desire to see again the 'Guermantes way,' it would not be satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of love, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me, though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest--so what I want to see again is the 'Guermantes way' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake. No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time, the Meseglise and Guermantes 'ways' left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for me alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the 'Meseglise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent lilac-trees. And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at Combray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days besides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste--by what would have been called at Combray the 'perfume'---of a cup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many years after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love affair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that accuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories, following one after another, were condensed into a single substance, but had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the three strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others, inspired more recently by a taste or 'perfume,' and those which were actually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at second hand--no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least those veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain marbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation. It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I was actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness, and--fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed the curtains and the window--would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working upon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have replaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed site. But scarcely had daylight itself--and no longer the gleam from a last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for daylight--traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with its curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had erroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table, which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and sweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my dressing-room had lain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which I had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted forefinger of day. To admit you to the 'little nucleus,' the 'little group,' the 'little clan' at the Verdurins', one condition sufficed, but that one was indispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose articles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under her patronage that year, and of whom she said ""Really, it oughtn't to be allowed, to play Wagner as well as that!"" left both Plante and Rubinstein 'sitting'; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than Potain. Each 'new recruit' whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the female sex. Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain class,' a Mme. de Crecy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined. The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid' there. There was never any programme for the evening's entertainment. The young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: ""We're all friends here. Liberty Hall, you know!"" If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an impression. ""Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite well, it's the same every time he plays that. I know what I'm in for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up--nothing doing!"" If he was not going to play they talked, and one of the friends--usually the painter who was in favour there that year--would ""spin,"" as M. Verdurin put it, ""a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter,"" and especially Mme. Verdurin, for whom--so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions--Dr. Cottard, who was then just starting in general practice, would ""really have to come one day and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much."" Evening dress was barred, because you were all 'good pals,' and didn't want to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the plague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known.

"supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little 'clan.' But just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place in Mme. Verdurin's life, so the 'bores,' the 'nuisances' grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made them sometimes plead 'previous engagements,' the mother of one, the professional duties of another, the 'little place in the country' of a third. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; ""I don't know,"" Mme. Verdurin would say, ""I'm sure it will do him far more good if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a good night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured."" From the beginning of December it would make her quite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on Christmas and New Year's Days. The pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on the latter, to a family dinner at her mother's. ""You don't suppose she'll die, your mother,"" exclaimed Mme. Verdurin bitterly, ""if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day, like people in the _provinces_!"" Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: ""Now you, Doctor, you're a sensible, broad-minded man; you'll come, of course, on Good Friday, just like any other day?"" she said to Cottard in the first year of the little 'nucleus,' in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone. ""I shall come on Good Friday--to say good-bye to you, for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne."" ""In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot of good that will do you!"" And after a solemn pause: ""If you had only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together, comfortably."" And so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: ""Very well, then, bring your friend along."" And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' If he failed to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the 'faithful.' And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with boundless ingenuity. ""My dear, Mme. de Crecy has something to say to you. She would like to bring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?"" ""Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a piece of perfection."" ""Just as you like,"" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: ""You know I'm not fishing for compliments."" ""Very well; bring your friend, if he's nice."" Now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and the society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders' that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess, would tremble for fear of being despised, and would instantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace's maid. Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh. If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his 'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody's cook. It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects,",3.6107264262836187,1.1120810352584245,0.42334881991060413,0.06597078955540406,4.329928498467824,4.0,2.382141827946521,37.65384615384615,28.5,33.92462494287583,1.2941777323799795,1.0,0.6497243959394022,1958,700,0.3575076608784474,8829,52,70.31310212048443,3.4402678463424956e+30,1.5075669791159052e+27,0.7834405542588702,0.7721414948999882,59.12890999449991,14.366297242083757,12.091993763477543,17.676451638249393,17.790886304706525,8.87387129724208,55.324939105837984,6.653846153846154,True,1239.0,0.8663453111305872,3.86897458369851,2282.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003154281473234994,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011132758140829391,0.004824195194359403,0.003896465349290287,0.0056967572304995615,44,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair' began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: ""Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!"" And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted. Occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been complaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce with satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my grandmother, as he hummed the air of: What is this mystery? I cannot understand it; or of: Vision fugitive...; In matters such as this 'Tis best to close one's eyes. A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend ""What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?"" the other's face would lengthen: ""Never mention his name to me again!"" ""But I thought that you were such friends..."" He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform. But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her. ""No good depending on Swann for this evening,"" people would say; ""don't you remember, it's his American's night at the Opera?"" He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love. But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Crecy by an old friend of his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest her so much, she, ""an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,"" saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be ""so comfortable with his tea and his books""; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was ""not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man."" And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her. And so, at an age when it would appear--since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure--that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice. Odette de Crecy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent, and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely buried. But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. ""And won't you,"" she had ventured, ""come just once and take tea with me?"" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay--which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago--on Vermeer of Delft. ""I know that I am quite useless,"" she had replied, ""a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!"" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air",3.632532962885183,1.2382322092533047,0.420262502651145,0.055157408757832156,4.287608363080061,4.0,2.3203189659252135,47.829268292682926,30.0,46.73062527389287,1.2804691483936768,1.0,0.6321901935233472,1961,716,0.36511983681795,8715,41,65.42374829499823,2.589243352570312e+28,1.1517986443818115e+25,0.8113189712166786,0.8122961956721085,49.96060272882181,18.17295058519173,13.418234109909701,21.84460889789928,22.67926953644855,8.792269250382454,64.1474732901332,7.804878048780488,True,1248.0,0.876779359430605,3.876779359430605,2248.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015189873417721518,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007969995311767463,0.0033755274261603376,0.0,0.0,45,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which Cottard styled ""letting 'em all come""), Swann supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him very pleasant. ""Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have been,"" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour, ""perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait"" (for which she had given the painter a commission). ""Take care, Master Biche,"" she reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as 'Master,' ""to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've asked you to paint--the portrait of his smile."" And since the phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the distinction: ""M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette"") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused. ""She is such an excellent woman!"" he rejoined. ""I grant you that she is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her."" ""I am sure she can,"" Swann hastened to conciliate him. ""All I meant was that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'"" he went on, isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, ""and, after all, that is something of a compliment."" ""Wait a moment,"" said M. Verdurin, ""now, this will surprise you; she writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M. Swann?"" ""I should count myself most fortunate..."" Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind. ""Most fortunate for France!"" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing. ""What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner,"" shouted Mme. Verdurin. ""You don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance,"" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects. From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'--and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity--she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling. Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his pipe (""No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!""), went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano. ""Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,"" cried Mme. Verdurin. ""I won't have him tormented."" ""But why on earth should it bother him?"" rejoined M. Verdurin. ""I'm sure M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement."" ""No, no, no, not my sonata!"" she screamed, ""I don't want to be made to cry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed, for a week."" This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been so amusingly done. ""Well, all right, then,"" said M. Verdurin, ""he can play just the andante."" ""Just the _andante_! How you do go on,"" cried his wife. ""As if it weren't 'just the _andante_' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need only have the _finale_,' or 'just the overture' of the _Meistersinger_."" The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states--but from his habit, common to many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared",3.306888607334125,1.2293817992940992,0.4060088348281933,0.07645888345443587,4.44065206316862,4.0,2.4262778552655893,30.671875,22.5,29.74897828471383,1.3255221599592462,1.0,0.6691633525168007,1963,725,0.369332654100866,9183,64,73.91668380587839,1.2635949963095034e+32,5.300314581835166e+28,0.7206717885675884,0.7103416136195583,63.56387214244779,12.013192737519109,12.133473702887393,15.508688869077941,14.8214087175242,9.345980641874682,49.82623057819664,5.875,True,1200.0,0.8322147651006712,3.851929530201342,2384.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01006018144255816,0.007185843887541543,0.003952214138147849,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008982304859426929,0.005838498158627504,0.0,0.013422818791946308,47,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her ""hands right in the dish itself."" ""You will only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,"" she meant Vermeer, ""I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say 'There, that's what he's thinking about!' What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work."" He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. ""You are afraid of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!"" she had said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched. ""Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest are all like her. She can't have understood you: you are so utterly different from ordinary men. That's what I liked about you when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren't like everybody else."" ""And then, besides, there's yourself----"" he had continued, ""I know what women are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time to spare."" ""I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like--to introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my finding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone."" No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if, thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Crecy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish. It so happened that my grandfather had known--which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance--the family of these Verdurins. But he had entirely severed his connection with what he called ""young Verdurin,"" taking a general view of him as one who had fallen--though without losing hold of his millions--among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One day he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the Verdurins. ""On guard! on guard!"" he exclaimed as he read it, ""I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don't mix myself up in such matters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after the little Verdurins."" And on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house. The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful. Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: ""Do you really mean that?"" He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own. On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education. So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it. As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended by those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue blood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion, 'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other 'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek. As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: ""It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're rather too near the stage,"" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied: ""To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you, you are so good."" And he went on, ""Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they call the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the boards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?"" in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming. ""D'you know,"" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, ""I believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he accepts everything that we say as gospel."" ""I never dared to mention it,"" M. Verdurin had answered, ""but I've noticed the same thing myself."" And on the following New Year's Day, instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match. When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that evening; ""Swann!"" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, ""Swann! Who on earth is Swann?"" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, ""Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about."" ""Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,"" answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. ""Nothing amuses me more than match-making,"" he confided to Cottard; ""I have been tremendously successful, even with women!"" In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived, however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which, though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body.

"to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important, the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor. ""You won't be ill this time, you'll find,"" he told her, seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. ""And, if you are ill, we will cure you."" ""Will you, really?"" Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon their feet. Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying to Mme. Verdurin, ""I have my own little corner, haven't I?"" And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up. ""You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?"" ""What charming Beauvais!"" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite. ""I am glad you appreciate my sofa,"" replied Mme. Verdurin, ""and I warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them;--I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design! Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them properly!"" ""If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,"" said the painter, ""we shan't get any music to-night."" ""Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,"" she went on, ""are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say that you never have been jealous!"" ""But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call you as a witness; did I utter a word?"" Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not like to stop. ""Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the young gentleman who will take charge of that."" After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests, for the following reason: The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony--he knew not which--that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression _sine materia_. Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the _motifs_ which now and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;--if our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and strange desire. With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere, towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her name. Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead--and better late than never--a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of",3.161572103090832,1.2564550319126826,0.41378054681029264,0.09325177194743871,4.380806533945891,4.0,2.4061685154611494,27.208333333333332,18.0,24.89251198207561,1.3210821847881573,1.0,0.6759332896305338,1959,730,0.37263910158244,8980,72,75.22802451962394,4.689385469025549e+32,2.019545852293518e+29,0.763698902138522,0.7266648030706815,67.45498883358859,10.610019780500256,11.264054261293257,13.864446145992853,12.807765441551815,8.871240428790198,45.84028841245534,5.069444444444445,True,1237.0,0.85099052540913,3.867355727820844,2322.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00292772186642269,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009332113449222324,0.0036596523330283625,0.0038426349496797803,0.004306632213608958,48,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it. But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth--and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the _andante_ movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret. And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin. ""Isn't he charming?"" she asked Swann, ""doesn't he just understand it, his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in it except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think I'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an orchestra, more complete."" The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram: ""You are most generous to me."" And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, ""Run and fetch him a glass of orangeade; it's well earned!"" Swann began to tell Odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a little way off, called out, ""Well! It looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you, Odette!"" she replied, ""Yes, very nice,"" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata;--what meaning the little phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know. But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed, ""I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to confess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to know it!""--and the painter had gone on with, ""Ah, yes, it's a very fine bit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,' something 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us artists.""), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply. Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, ""D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit of ours, that's all,"" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people--real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple. And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme. Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata) like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: ""Yes, indeed; he's what they call a musician _di primo cartello_!"" he exclaimed, with a sudden determination. Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil's sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public. ""I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,"" said Swann, thinking of the old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters. ""Perhaps that's the man!"" cried Mme. Verdurin. ""Oh, no!"" Swann burst out laughing. ""If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn't put the question."" ""Then to put the question is to solve the problem?"" the Doctor suggested. ""But it may well be some relative,"" Swann went on. ""That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be ghastly."" The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and that Dr. Potain despaired of his life. ""What!"" cried Mme. Verdurin, ""Do people still call in Potain?"" ""Ah! Mme. Verdurin,"" Cottard simpered, ""you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues--I should say, one of my masters."" The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of these. ""Don't speak to me about 'your masters'; you know ten times as much as he does!"" Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. ""Anyhow, you don't kill your patients!"" ""But, Madame, he is in the Academy."" The Doctor smiled with bitter irony. ""If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, 'Yes, I have Potain.'"" ""Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?"" said Mme. Verdurin. ""So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn't know that.... Oh, you do make me laugh!"" she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands. ""And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing that you were pulling my leg."" As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth. ""D'you know; we like your friend so very much,"" said Mme. Verdurin, later, when Odette was bidding her good night. ""He is so unaffected, quite charming. If they're all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by all means bring them."" M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate the pianist's aunt. ""I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,"" suggested Mme. Verdurin. ""You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us to-morrow at the Chatelet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him."" ""No, he doesn't want that."" ""Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn't fail us at the last moment."" Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's",3.0394606159405466,1.0781775952273602,0.3875155063202597,0.08627945945885566,4.307182883341824,4.0,2.24320661444768,22.563218390804597,15.0,20.591093459839517,1.2771268466632706,1.0,0.6053097519283094,1963,661,0.336729495669893,9015,87,81.00346373332904,1.511323079153139e+35,6.186340888878997e+31,0.7302858514148135,0.7183090585119584,75.88840210562066,8.279751963040386,9.89405987194052,11.51127818668353,10.13844057594229,8.214365766683649,39.883646307259,3.9080459770114944,True,1243.0,0.8231682357756857,3.6901350798198935,2443.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02079343365253078,0.004012767897856817,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004651162790697674,0.015412676698586411,0.005107159142726858,0.01637331150225133,49,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: ""I'll see to that, all right. You shall have it in time for the _Danicheff_ revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elysee."" ""What's that? The Elysee?"" Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder. ""Yes, at M. Grevy's,"" replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced. ""Are you often taken like that?"" the painter asked Cottard, with mock-seriousness. As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: ""Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,"" after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State. ""What's that you say? M. Grevy? Do you know M. Grevy?"" he demanded of Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the newspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary. ""I know him slightly; we have some friends in common"" (Swann dared not add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). ""Anyhow, he is very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you know; never more than eight at table,"" he went on, trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes. Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Grevy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at the Elysee'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore. ""Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,"" he said, in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage. ""I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed, it's very good of you to go to them!"" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded, since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them 'fail.' ""It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers."" ""Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there."" A note of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the number--only eight at table--""Are these luncheons what you would describe as 'intimate'?"" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal. But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking anxiously, ""D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a personal friend of M. Grevy's. I suppose that means he's what you'd call a 'gentleman'?"" He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition. ""This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,"" he explained, ""but dogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there was the devil to pay."" As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken. If no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the Verdurins' that Swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties. ""I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,"" she suggested. ""But what about Mme. Verdurin?"" ""Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" ""How charming of you."" But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; Remi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: ""I am furious with you!"" and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them--for their two selves, and for no one else--that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and--just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door--infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light--as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come--than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself--which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. ""Why do you want the rest?"" she had asked him. ""Our little bit; that's all we need."" He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled.' It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La Perouse, behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for the night. And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage; and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and murmured ""Till to-morrow, then!"" she turned impulsively from him, plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive home, and when, in due",3.4790037525064683,1.519627707078673,0.39708440972762377,0.08567744414112177,4.271065989847716,4.0,2.2697805928784787,30.307692307692307,23.0,28.6243162239719,1.2822335025380711,1.0,0.624815982083055,1970,673,0.3416243654822335,8891,65,79.24324440464423,2.5995835076924036e+34,1.082257913277437e+31,0.7117179595516063,0.6711196892318272,67.5957379929715,11.36035532994924,11.362043627235082,14.864193674345959,13.840566966028895,8.337218274111674,47.160484185864895,5.107692307692307,True,1273.0,0.8318068276436303,3.7014987510407993,2402.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009593210958398673,0.004243151000830182,0.004243151000830182,0.004243151000830182,0.004243151000830182,0.0,0.010607877502075454,0.00599575684899917,0.005534544783691541,0.008742714404662781,50,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"course, the flower withered, locked it away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk. He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony--of such vital importance in her life--of 'afternoon tea.' The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside. Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette's bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been 'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, ""You're not comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,"" and with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human--filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight--she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over--and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. ""It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,"" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired ""Lemon or cream?"" and, on his answering ""Cream, please,"" went on, smiling, ""A cloud!"" And as he pronounced it excellent, ""You see, I know just how you like it."" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: ""What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea."" An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. ""Why,"" she wrote, ""did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back."" More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve _crepe de Chine_, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman Remi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving--though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music--had enriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his",4.267459744114045,1.3295523344100995,0.41670607034664947,0.06652083830819223,4.491886409736308,4.0,2.440246365392488,59.75757575757576,55.0,40.526108534017034,1.317444219066937,1.0,0.6646995687266269,1972,798,0.40466531440162273,9213,33,73.16813750116796,5.977483251081634e+31,2.5977762933861946e+28,0.831737520173192,0.8041733955183337,34.72527967299774,23.261296330444406,15.308715981407026,26.945626651914683,29.605572868645886,10.116957403651114,80.85291044317414,12.606060606060606,True,1179.0,0.8622338113863538,4.003911342894393,2301.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003941592761802383,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012899758129535071,0.002149959688255845,0.0,0.002607561929595828,51,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness--as of carnation-petals--which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible. He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural. And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a collector. On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might, ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart. It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the manner--at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable--which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter: and he was right--by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the Maison Doree--it was the day of the Paris-Murcie Fete given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write----""; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come running up to him with an ""I've something to say to you!"" and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart. Even as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the painter: ""H'm. Seems to be getting warm."" Indeed, her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart. And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home. But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions. ""Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?"" M. Verdurin asked his wife. ""I think we may say that he's hooked."" ""The face he pulled?"" exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing. ""D'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep--the loveliest of Swanns?"" ""No. M. Swann has been here?"" ""Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated. In a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left."" ""You mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she has 'burned her boats'?"" inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning of his phrases. ""Why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between you and me, I think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a silly little fool, which she is, incidentally."" ""Come, come, come!"" said M. Verdurin, ""How on earth do you know that there's 'nothing in it'? We haven't been there to see, have we now?"" ""She would have told me,"" answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. ""I may say that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can't; she admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he's always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn't care for him in that way, she says; it's an ideal love, 'Platonic,' you know; she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off--oh, I don't know half the things she says, how should I? And yet he's exactly the sort of man she wants."" ""I beg to differ from you,"" M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. ""I am only half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he 'poses.'"" Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself. ""Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don't suppose it's because our friend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to believe in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard",3.393614441770576,1.378911167505361,0.40621245153162794,0.072328055301359,4.362710137544575,4.0,2.3579080134155195,34.43859649122807,25.0,31.950629427871693,1.2959755476311767,1.0,0.6537786273225071,1963,710,0.36169128884360674,8972,57,71.7570882007572,1.457831879483695e+31,6.272942682804195e+27,0.7632514041449342,0.7620280168273232,62.24029323180598,13.133564093626834,12.14588429083054,16.66896890724008,16.33766299344898,8.993234844625572,52.06467901797285,6.0701754385964914,True,1238.0,0.8558519793459552,3.8605851979345953,2324.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006866874198864677,0.004028566196667277,0.0,0.006454388984509466,52,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"the way he lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted to Odette, but really--to expound theories of aesthetic to her--the man must be a prize idiot."" ""Look here, I won't have you saying nasty things about Odette,"" broke in Mme. Verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. ""She is charming."" ""There's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect. After all,"" he turned to the painter, ""does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can't tell; she might be a great deal less charming if she were."" On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Prevost's on her way home. Swann set off at once for Prevost's, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Prevost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Prevost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even--but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting. It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Prevost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace. She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman Remi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan) for whom he presently--after a fruitless search--found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which Remi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady is there,"" or as one in which Remi would say to him: ""Sir, the lady was not in any of the cafes."" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening--a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her. The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not ""Did you find the lady?"" but ""Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short."" Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if Remi had at last found Odette in some cafe, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, ""I have found the lady,"" he would have answered, ""Oh, yes, of course; that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,"" and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure. The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, ""I think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home."" But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when Remi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off cloak when he saw Remi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest. ""Certainly not!"" he exclaimed. ""We must find the lady. It is most important. She would be extremely put out--it's a business matter--and vexed with me if she didn't see me."" ""But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,"" answered Remi, ""since it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was going to Prevost's, and then wasn't there."" Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice. Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as--in the moment when she has failed to meet us--for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage--the insensate, agonising desire to possess her. Swann made Remi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette--assuming that she had long since gone home to bed,--might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison Doree, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching sight of her, was emerging from the Cafe Anglais, striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had been no room at Prevost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the Maison Doree, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage. She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,--it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth--'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to",3.5415266129343785,1.4522792437003567,0.4171069266663029,0.07273985175613622,4.337398373983739,4.0,2.312695550913883,37.132075471698116,29.0,32.58315210891657,1.2876016260162602,1.0,0.6316586275718665,1968,667,0.3389227642276423,8923,53,71.2639541515822,8.903116302155849e+30,3.8608483530597786e+27,0.7494755778461695,0.7511638651291529,60.21484583525081,14.085208620954138,11.58064280880459,17.21055376591502,17.565184077312473,8.90674796747967,55.72963644730787,6.90566037735849,True,1285.0,0.8629661751951431,3.8694709453599305,2306.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014899291823783684,0.014899291823783684,0.014899291823783684,0.00974891934148809,0.00974891934148809,0.00974891934148809,0.008737239032465741,0.005518256231030994,0.0,0.004770164787510842,53,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the piano, some of her favourite music, the _Valse des Roses_, the _Pauvre Fou_ of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of Swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts of Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,--for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,--to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: ""How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me?"" Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there, giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy--by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'--might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another. He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire for knowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words. On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Vermeer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Crecy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as",3.938428439279351,1.291323545054198,0.4232642887981222,0.060220514855691895,4.427914110429448,4.0,2.34682440983958,46.57142857142857,31.5,42.72734312287784,1.3067484662576687,1.0,0.6843080933231954,1956,721,0.36860940695296524,8992,42,70.74332020047753,5.28973108855281e+30,2.3447389576918484e+27,0.8597220415022315,0.8278204254806042,49.01407975460123,17.99248904469763,13.74371610233738,21.59380660239556,22.711189745836982,9.600552147239263,64.87408705813613,8.523809523809524,True,1222.0,0.87322695035461,3.9858156028368796,2256.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0045695485286053735,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005940413087186986,0.009321878998354963,0.0,0.004875886524822695,55,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet. He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow. She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,' also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless. ""It's all right,"" he assured her, ""don't be frightened."" And he slipped his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went on: ""Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid of their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more securely."" She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and smiled as she answered: ""No, not at all; I don't mind in the least."" But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: ""No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little--I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,--may I brush it off with my hand? That's not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I don't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now."" Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should say, ""You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it."" He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return. But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: ""It is most unfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?"" Or else, if she had none: ""Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there's nothing for me to arrange."" So that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor ""Do a cattleya,"" transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying ""to make love"" had not the precise significance of its synonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be--or be thought to be--so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason--as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise--a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure--and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity--entirely individual and new. The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: ""What on earth does it matter what people see?"" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when--more and more rarely--he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: ""He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,"" made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted",3.3827529576294433,1.0563640972605128,0.4077711065339435,0.06780420803770944,4.318899643402955,4.0,2.338667935883583,34.43859649122807,23.0,29.45351231184232,1.2745797249108508,1.0,0.6267112195921136,1963,694,0.35354049923586345,8869,57,68.98759452527787,9.13969329402431e+29,3.9772381610201525e+26,0.8141789808869362,0.7888609586791558,64.05037983394556,12.881093385526988,11.520995432342353,16.281806400872277,16.131315566041955,8.735629139072845,52.21750632311803,6.12280701754386,True,1310.0,0.8664055700609226,3.859442993907746,2298.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010537018208706905,0.004991219151492744,0.004991219151492744,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006470098900083187,0.001941029670024956,0.003604769387189204,0.005657093124456049,54,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"house on the Quai d'Orleans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered unworthy of him. It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for 'bric-a-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: ""Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!"" Incidentally, she had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Chateau at Blois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of his abode on the Quai d'Orleans; he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming, but in the 'Sham-Antique.' ""You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs and threadbare carpets!"" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman. People who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she would come home saying: ""Why, he's an adorable creature; so sensitive! I had no idea,"" and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add, pouting: ""It's not the same thing, you see, with him,"" and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary. Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the _Reine Topaze_, or when her eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's certificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips. ""Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her wishes."" As Swann's sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: ""I really do think--for a man, that is to say--it is tremendously smart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!"" she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went again to _Serge Panine_, if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch Olivier Metra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached to receiving cards for a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her. Like everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained 'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her was all that he could ask. ""What a charming atmosphere!"" he said to himself. ""How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for the painter,",3.4979841811378782,1.4653089636514018,0.43052498953870494,0.0750690680117684,4.376590330788804,4.0,2.3495246831542946,40.9375,26.0,36.23500048870797,1.2880407124681934,1.0,0.6642330735145892,1965,707,0.3597964376590331,8979,48,72.01108227922116,1.8793846255163786e+31,8.128826234932434e+27,0.7927930856004675,0.7872995980407881,56.31519322519087,15.574505407124686,12.348004659719614,18.919529262086513,19.652490458015265,9.21129770992366,57.68050254452926,6.854166666666667,True,1255.0,0.8546712802768166,3.883650519031142,2312.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010979961570134504,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0059474791838228565,0.005489980785067252,0.0032939884710403516,0.003027681660899654,57,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear--changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks--an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love, had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life--a life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him--of his mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom. Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the _Valse des Roses_, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: ""I'm sure, poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished."" If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: ""Yes... I never thought it would be like that."" And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, ""More in it? What?... Do tell me!"", but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love. With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. ""You're always so reserved; I can't make you out."" She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas--for those are entirely beyond them--but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. ""But,"" Swann objected, ""surely, people don't all know your friend."" ""Yes, don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid."" Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as ""People are so horrid,"" and ""A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,"" were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance--with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre--over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic--common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed--of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: ""He never goes to any place that isn't really smart."" And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, ""Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de l'Imperatrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Theatre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls..."" ""What balls?"" ""Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean. Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of the jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad, now, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball. You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you."" Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings. ""But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a marquise! Goodness knows I'm not a marquise, but you'd have to pay me a lot of money before you'd get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!"" Nor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his",3.3414404036255467,1.3296343021882011,0.4084558697916987,0.08293033154405836,4.285931945149822,4.0,2.2619268354836506,31.253968253968253,19.0,28.9410831479537,1.2732351447435246,1.0,0.619227837178048,1969,679,0.3448450990350432,8874,63,71.60412875778664,1.2510596034213946e+31,5.367051065728849e+27,0.7033922048961564,0.7098655838091843,67.39652897692007,11.62322232702121,10.813802987103665,14.817483695695987,14.38372358863979,8.4542001015744,47.709021580529964,5.142857142857143,True,1276.0,0.8571428571428571,3.806949806949807,2331.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009238728750923873,0.005912786400591279,0.005912786400591279,0.005912786400591279,0.0,0.0,0.009700665188470067,0.0024944567627494456,0.0,0.003432003432003432,56,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare exceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more and more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them."" And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: ""Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?""; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was ""a great and noble soul."" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, ""I'd a hundred times rather,"" he would reply, ""have the Verdurins."" And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: ""They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!"" he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, ""The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain--how could they?--without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy."" * * * He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to him. And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society--doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort. What a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom they were building great hopes--the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement: the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,' which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,--whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of Swann. There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that curiosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies, earn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan' what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung. Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great pains with her toilet, observed to her: ""Quite original, that white dress,"" the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a ""de,"" and was on the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective '_blanche_' and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out, ""_Blanche_? Blanche of Castile?"" then, without moving his head, shot a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin. ""What are you to say of a scientist like that?"" she asked Forcheville. ""You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?"" she went on, turning to the Doctor. ""They must have some pretty lively times there, if that's the case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!"" ""I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of Castile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?"" Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream. ""Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, _sub rosa_... I recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian--oh, how infinitely Athenian--Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes, indeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!"" he repeated in his",3.376515302541084,1.425818958248282,0.40877762908225707,0.11433183376445216,4.515274949083503,4.0,2.48299119833353,32.19672131147541,22.0,28.222662485576933,1.3375763747454175,1.0,0.706093230007351,1964,713,0.3630346232179226,9276,61,74.76169364200764,2.9416500523183045e+32,1.2512335399057017e+29,0.7393902997175853,0.7109260940450733,60.996366565390176,12.750122533471338,12.637848715322512,16.320643718072855,15.935305665921,9.830468431771891,51.95232212613936,6.360655737704918,True,1234.0,0.8400680561463207,3.9455550829434283,2351.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017103153393907,0.007126313914127917,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00935328701229289,0.01389631213254944,0.0,0.015312632922160783,58,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"ringing voice, which sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by M. Verdurin. ""The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased."" ""Who is that gentleman?"" Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. ""He seems to speak with great authority."" ""What! Do you mean to say you don't know the famous Brichot? Why, he's celebrated all over Europe."" ""Oh, that's Brechot, is it?"" exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite caught the name. ""You must tell me all about him""; he went on, fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. ""It's always interesting to meet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties here. No dull evenings in this house, I'm sure."" ""Well, you know what it is really,"" said Mme. Verdurin modestly. ""They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is nothing. I've seen him, don't you know, when he's been with me, simply dazzling; you'd want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else he's not the same man, he's not in the least witty, you have to drag the words out of him, he's even boring."" ""That's strange,"" remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment. A sort of wit like Brichot's would have been regarded as out-and-out stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence of the Professor's vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything in Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme. Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the house. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked him on her arrival: ""What do you think of my guest?"" And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good specimen of a man, had retorted: ""Beastly!"" He had, certainly, no idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile's mother, who, according to him, ""had been with Henry Plantagenet for years before they were married,"" tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting ""Isn't that so, M. Swann?"" in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into a trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions. ""From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call 'elevated,'"" said Swann with a smile. ""Elevated... to the height of an Institute!"" interrupted Cottard, raising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing. ""What did I tell you?"" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. ""It's simply impossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes with a joke."" But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend. ""I went up to one of them,"" he began, ""just to see how it was done; I stuck my nose into it. Yes, I don't think! Impossible to say whether it was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with leaven, with excrem..."" ""And one make twelve!"" shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for no one saw the point of his interruption. ""It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,"" resumed the painter. ""No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the 'Night Watch,' or the 'Regents,' and it's even bigger work than either Rembrandt or Hals ever did. It's all there,--and yet, no, I'll take my oath it isn't."" Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: ""It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you feel ticklish all over--and not the faintest clue to how it's done. The man's a sorcerer; the thing's a conjuring-trick, it's a miracle,"" bursting outright into laughter, ""it's dishonest!"" Then stopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, ""And it's so loyal!"" Except at the moment when he had called it ""bigger than the 'Night Watch,'"" a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the 'Night Watch' as the supreme masterpiece of the universe (conjointly with the 'Ninth' and the 'Samothrace'), and at the word ""excrement,"" which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was 'all right,' before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter. ""I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!"" cried Mme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was dining with them for the first time. ""Hallo, you!"" she turned to her husband, ""what's the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great animal? You know, though, don't you,"" she apologised for him to the painter, ""that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without missing a word."" ""No, really, I'm not joking!"" protested the painter, enchanted by the success of his speech. ""You all look as if you thought I was pulling your legs, that it was just a trick. I'll take you to see the show, and then you can say whether I've been exaggerating; I'll bet you anything you like, you'll come away more 'up in the air' than I am!"" ""But we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating; we only want you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more sole, can't you see his has got cold? We're not in any hurry; you're dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don't serve the salad just yet."" Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking, for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career. And so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which Mme. Verdurin had just uttered, to pass unchallenged. ""It's not a Japanese salad, is it?"" she whispered, turning towards Odette. And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it. ""Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,"" said Forcheville. ""No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday."" ""You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,"" said Mme. Cottard to Swann, ""but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous _Francillon_ that everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Theatre-Francais is never wasted, really; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,"" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to ""some friends of ours"" or ""one of my friends,"" as being more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) ""who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this _Francillon_ sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking--it's only natural--about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,"" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. ""I must admit, though, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her",2.945472925288911,1.0314239181790195,0.39530043487104777,0.07531954625200354,4.274898373983739,4.0,2.3284952723968737,22.363636363636363,17.5,20.39506503264823,1.271341463414634,1.0,0.6267672812664611,1968,681,0.34603658536585363,9000,88,80.71837477271427,1.1364353959165488e+35,4.599091039727029e+31,0.7414641087425167,0.7136484424388686,76.58042128603108,8.133647450110868,9.631235645658698,11.262527716186254,9.886589523281593,8.012825203252028,39.48762010347376,3.8295454545454546,True,1289.0,0.8191015783083772,3.642250101173614,2471.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013059360730593607,0.0032876712328767125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0052054794520547945,0.009497716894977169,0.0019178082191780822,0.013354917037636584,59,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"no. I'm quite sure they aren't the same family,"" said Mme. Verdurin desperately. Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Tremoille, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, ""All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,"" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject ""_Se non e vero_,"" but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out. After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. ""She can't have been at all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she's a woman you can really talk to; that's all I want. Of course she's getting a bit broad in the beam. But Mme. de Crecy! There's a little woman who knows what's what, all right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she's got the American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Crecy,"" he explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. ""I should say that, as a specimen of the female form--"" ""I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!"" the words came tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion, inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a different way. M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: ""I must just go and see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,"" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough began all over again. ""Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,"" counselled Mme. Verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs. ""What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!"" declared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. ""Thank you, thank you, an old soldier like me can never say 'No' to a drink."" ""M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,"" M. Verdurin told his wife. ""Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon. We must arrange it, but don't on any account let Swann hear about it. He spoils everything, don't you know. I don't mean to say that you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very often. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can. That won't bore you, will it, a quiet little dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite delightful.... ""Aren't you going to do any work this evening, I say?"" she screamed suddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying, before a 'newcomer' of Forcheville's importance, at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the 'faithful.' ""M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,"" Mme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he, still following up the idea of Forcheville's noble birth, which had obsessed him all through dinner, began again with: ""I am treating a Baroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren't there some Putbuses in the Crusades? Anyhow they've got a lake in Pomerania that's ten times the size of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she's a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe."" Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: ""He's an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors."" ""D'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?"" asked the pianist. ""What the devil's that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!"" shouted M. de Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: ""No, no. The word isn't _serpent-a-sonates_, it's _serpent-a-sonnettes_!"" he explained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant. Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed. ""You'll admit it's not bad, eh, Doctor?"" ""Oh! I've known it for ages."" Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it--and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley--the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville. ""Ah! you've come too late!"" Verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,' whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' ""we've been having a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But he's gone. Isn't that so, M. Swann? I believe it's the first time you've met him,"" she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann owed the introduction. ""Isn't that so; wasn't he delicious, our Brichot?"" Swann bowed politely. ""No? You weren't interested?"" she asked dryly. ""Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow."" The party broke up very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: ""I have rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night."" ""What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?"" said Forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' Odette watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he asked whether he might come in, replied, ""I suppose so,"" with an impatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her husband: ""Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Tremoille?"" She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the particle 'de' before that lady's name. Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively ""the de La Tremoilles,"" or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'), ""the d'La Tremoilles,"" but she corrected herself at once to ""Madame La Tremoille.--The _Duchess_, as Swann calls her,"" she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd. ""I don't mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid."" M. Verdurin took it up. ""He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't. Not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!"" he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort. ""I don't mind saying,"" Mme. Verdurin went on, ""that he saw fit to utter some most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a way of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party.

"cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I'm sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her next 'day'; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh till we cried. I don't know; perhaps it was the way she told it,"" Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave. And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by _Francillon_: ""Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all. I don't suppose it's as good as the piece Mme. de Crecy worships, _Serge Panine_. There's a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Theatre-Francais! Now, _Serge Panine_--! But then, it's like everything that comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it's so well written. I wonder if you know the _Maitre des Forges_, which I like even better than _Serge Panine_."" ""Pardon me,"" said Swann with polite irony, ""but I can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces."" ""Really, now; that's very interesting. And what don't you like about them? Won't you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he's a little too sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best."" She was interrupted by Forcheville's addressing Swann. What had happened was that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing _Francillon_, Forcheville had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the ""little speech"" of the painter. ""Your friend has such a flow of language, such a memory!"" he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill, ""I've seldom seen anything like it. He'd make a first-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Brechot you've drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I'm not so sure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn't knock spots off the Professor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and all that; but that's quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it's not often I've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, 'hold the spittoon,' as we used to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything you liked--I don't know what--this glass, say; and he'd talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass; that's a silly thing to say, I'm sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him."" ""Do you see much of M. Swann?"" asked Mme. Verdurin. ""Oh dear, no!"" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: ""Isn't that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?--But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Tremoilles, with the Laumes and all that lot!"" The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Tremoilles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Tremoilles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor'! ""You'd need to pay me a lot of money before I'd let any of that lot set foot inside my house,"" Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on Swann. She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who at once exclaimed: ""To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them; I'm sure I should be afraid; one can't be too careful. How can people be so common as to go running after them?"" But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: ""Gad, she's a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,"" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, ""And a lot of good may it do them!"" Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in: ""Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan't repeat it to them, you may be sure."" To which Swann answered: ""Why, I'm not in the least afraid of the Duchess (if it is of the La Tremoilles that you're speaking). I can assure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don't go so far as to say that she's at all 'deep'--"" he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth--""but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people. His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her tortured heart, ""You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not say so to us."" ""It all depends upon what you call intelligence."" Forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant. ""Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by intelligence."" ""There,"" cried Odette, ""that's one of the big things I beg him to tell me about, and he never will."" ""Oh, but..."" protested Swann. ""Oh, but nonsense!"" said Odette. ""A water-butt?"" asked the Doctor. ""To you,"" pursued Forcheville, ""does intelligence mean what they call clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into society?"" ""Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!"" said Mme. Verdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped eating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, ""It doesn't matter; take your time about it; there's no hurry; I only reminded you because of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back."" ""There is,"" began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, ""a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist Fenelon..."" ""Just listen to this!"" Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor. ""He's going to give us Fenelon's definition of intelligence. That's interesting. It's not often you get a chance of hearing that!"" But Brichot was keeping Fenelon's definition until Swann should have given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville. ""You see, it's just the same as with me!"" Odette was peevish. ""I'm not at all sorry to see that I'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up to his level."" ""These de La Tremouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired,"" inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, ""are they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob, Sevigne, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for 'copy.' And, in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Tremouaille, kept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign politics.""

"the dear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he's going away."" ""Didn't I say so?"" retorted her husband. ""He's simply a failure; a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's at all big."" Had the truth been known, there was not one of the 'faithful' who was not infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with little sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of reserve on Swann's part, undraped in any such conventional formula as ""Of course, I don't want to say anything--"" to which he would have scorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs. Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love. As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist's or a jeweller's window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to the Rue La perouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious, always, that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins', might even--for all he knew--if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase, when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed. Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, ""It's your position that attracts her,"" or at this stage, ""It's your money that she's really in love with,"" he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes--as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed. One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman--an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels--with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;--the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up in a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure. In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet Odette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard--to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected--for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (""straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left"") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils--a new experience, this,--as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could never summon up courage",4.215532988808281,1.2118040619262216,0.42687972004812913,0.05575452988650378,4.405980739989863,4.0,2.4127774233676593,63.645161290322584,64.0,40.58010666856421,1.3066396350734921,1.0,0.6577091748889978,1973,719,0.3644196654840345,9018,31,69.40861523337108,1.3924467389106976e+30,6.120645006200868e+26,0.8938807467619578,0.891478351477919,31.693448163105174,24.649960597093017,15.526782691899815,28.418023968739273,31.144749930513548,9.642088190572728,82.70243447836111,12.129032258064516,True,1255.0,0.8729670329670329,3.963956043956044,2275.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009208606856309262,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007293946024799417,0.004558716265499635,0.005470459518599562,0.005274725274725275,62,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from Meseglise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and rose. After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly--especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the 'faithful' before their normal time--that on one occasion the Princesse des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the Bois) observed: ""Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us all as a joke."" He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the Ile des Cygnes or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature. One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual banquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard: ""Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then, till I get home; don't be too late."" And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy. When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it. It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep. ""No cattleya, then, to-night?"" he asked, ""and I've been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya."" But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: ""No, dear, no cattleya tonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?"" ""It might have done you good, but I won't bother you."" She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its message: ""She is there--expecting you,"" and now tortured him with: ""She is there with the man she was expecting."" He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger. And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago--though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette--now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette--Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to",3.9231547647164278,1.3485430261211824,0.41650924955631746,0.05791583270754444,4.264361972547026,4.0,2.199104565920719,51.76315789473684,41.0,41.90994996199798,1.2547025927808846,1.0,0.5833627953511319,1967,660,0.3355363497712252,8728,38,71.02637835228033,7.020437671480164e+30,3.076440697405856e+27,0.8616829933346929,0.8538585669464536,48.1475553875793,19.403122173761805,12.579926864409941,22.820158938270946,24.536723838064916,8.702613116420945,67.6248762475584,8.210526315789474,True,1268.0,0.8663453111305872,3.824715162138475,2282.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009365049634763064,0.003371417868514703,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009365049634763064,0.003371417868514703,0.003652369357557595,0.0052585451358457495,63,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"truth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. ""At any rate, this is true,"" she said to herself; ""that's always something to the good; he may make inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that will give me away."" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not be made to fit in, except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere. ""She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was myself, that she wanted to see me,"" Swann thought to himself. ""But that doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in."" He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;--what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,--a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not in themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of which--supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members--is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for good cooking. When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept on saying: ""What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you."" He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the Primavera. ' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing. What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair. He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as though some one were going away--probably the person whom Swann must on no account meet--after being told that Odette was not at home. And then, when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and murmured: ""Poor darling!"" When finally he left her, she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. ""If I saw what was in this,"" he argued, ""I should know what she calls him, what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter is posted."" He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper, to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If, instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to read. In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not that it",3.6833629492435693,1.1437854526369817,0.4167771099397112,0.07246058086463936,4.3719979560551865,4.0,2.3703139218013827,39.14,33.5,32.4271552868888,1.3045477772100154,1.0,0.6630974855257659,1957,680,0.34747061829330605,8878,50,72.5357821072847,3.1760688598705225e+31,1.4065849689417726e+28,0.8611738645300573,0.8422858640551567,56.74315804803271,15.068263771078183,12.619826905774921,18.47664384261625,18.73211037301993,9.151088400613183,56.66682677567706,6.86,True,1280.0,0.870682019486271,3.9317980513728963,2258.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010620613224972294,0.004432951606944958,0.0,0.00354295837023915,65,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"know the least details of a woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth. As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt--which he so desperately wanted to feel--that he had over them, lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice--he strained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the voice could be--asked: ""Who's that?"" He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible, too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty, welcoming tone: ""Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light. I wanted to know if you were feeling better."" He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, when he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold. But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,--with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another--of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber. A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: ""That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,"" that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: ""He need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time."" One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the",3.594211526217397,1.337946708619655,0.42716322574453114,0.06505140859069403,4.317395727365208,4.0,2.324177959461199,38.549019607843135,32.0,32.5409628582916,1.2777212614445574,1.0,0.6292158691542676,1966,688,0.34994913530010174,8825,51,71.56046681892518,1.1976112359197167e+31,5.243481768475117e+27,0.8156069296598435,0.7786768139625082,59.612526379829674,14.521228532104601,11.557038098267885,17.67800051862047,18.179443679811698,8.81843336724313,55.43609997406898,6.509803921568627,True,1253.0,0.8664623467600701,3.8638353765323994,2284.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00788863109048724,0.005104408352668214,0.0038979118329466357,0.004816112084063047,64,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line ""I was right,"" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: ""I was right to open the door; it was my uncle."" To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard. After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: ""Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back."" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once, why have said, ""I was right to open the door; it was my uncle."" Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without. From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible. A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party. The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: ""There must be no lights of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to see by."" Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence, an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Verdurin said to Swann: ""Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,"" trying, by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him from noticing that she was not saying, as she would always have until then: ""To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after."" M. and Mme. Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into his own. ""Odette, we'll take you,"" said Mme. Verdurin, ""we've kept a little corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville."" ""Yes, Mme. Verdurin,"" said Odette meekly. ""What! I thought I was to take you home,"" cried Swann, flinging discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her. ""But Mme. Verdurin has asked me..."" ""That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like this dozens of times,"" said Mme. Verdurin. ""But I had something important to tell Mme. de Crecy."" ""Very well, you can write it to her instead."" ""Good-bye,"" said Odette, holding out her hand. He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected. ""What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?"" Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. ""I was afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say, straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me."" A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: ""No, but, don't you see, the filthy creature..."" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself--like Francoise at Combray when the chicken refused to die--the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved on, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news. Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame. He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party next evening at Chatou. ""Imagine going to Chatou, of all places! Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have come out of one of Labiche's plays!"" The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. ""Could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one another like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at _Chatou_!"" Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country, ""for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a fool!"" He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. ""What a fetid form of humour!"" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar. ""How, in God's name, can a creature made in His image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of",3.2010443363859147,1.155971807646755,0.40459119220063905,0.07837171314421877,4.4,4.0,2.2955591555729282,25.128205128205128,20.0,21.167439300067098,1.2775510204081633,1.0,0.6090358074398062,1960,671,0.3423469387755102,9046,78,72.49848122394476,3.0597809888430186e+31,1.30983775207321e+28,0.7175499962328317,0.7186750105925297,73.24905546834118,9.28510204081633,10.27369392181895,12.541077969649399,11.858102564102566,8.894040816326534,43.495552066980636,4.615384615384615,True,1241.0,0.848458904109589,3.872431506849315,2336.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01764277919243361,0.012550018188432157,0.008730447435431065,0.008730447435431065,0.008730447435431065,0.008730447435431065,0.01045834849036013,0.009457984721716987,0.00327391778828665,0.0136986301369863,66,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!"" he cried, tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. ""God knows that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its limits, and mine is at an end,"" he concluded, as though this sacred mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from him. He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by Beethoven's music. ""Idiot, liar!"" he shouted, ""and a creature like that imagines that she's fond of _Art_!"" She would say to Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for himself: ""You can make room for M. de Forcheville there, can't you, Odette?""... '""In the dark!' Codfish! Pander!""... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in France. In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society. ""It really is,"" he repeated, ""beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now and then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there is in that '_Noli me tangere_' motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had almost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night: ""People 'in society' have their failings, as no one knows better than I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are impossible. So-and-so"" (a fashionable woman whom he had known) ""was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung."" But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him from Odette alone;--so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.' Doubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; ""I believe I have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!"" But it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table at their house: ""Why, aren't we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you might call a personal friend..."" ""I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!"" cried Mme. Verdurin. ""Heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for words, a stupid, ill-bred boor."" On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied: ""Oh--oh--oh--oh--oh!"" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins'. And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him, as she had said in the early days of their love: ""We shall meet, anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins',"" but ""We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins'."" Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Opera-Comique, to see _Une Nuit de Cleopatre_, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. ""Yet I'm not really angry,"" he assured himself, ""when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Masse! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all."" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Opera-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem. ""I swear to you,"" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the theatre, ""that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your _Nuit de Cleopatre_ (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the effect--I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your _Nuit de Cleopatre_ (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due warning. Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty. Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed",3.5649383582466654,1.6639713382442882,0.4293304859807399,0.05860089350519863,4.306950786402841,4.0,2.33749300611594,35.19642857142857,32.0,26.612577345292653,1.295788939624556,1.0,0.6475787351853626,1971,717,0.3637747336377473,8904,56,73.57109464026576,8.943766037300383e+31,3.8139727237954724e+28,0.7317668212408369,0.7029762033511091,61.486880707762595,13.426916630426906,12.031772070788634,16.8385917228383,16.45395248967167,8.683876204972094,52.14214140755236,5.964285714285714,True,1265.0,0.8477611940298507,3.7970149253731345,2345.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.030403537866224434,0.021006080707573246,0.015662428597751982,0.010871568085498435,0.010871568085498435,0.010871568085498435,0.0073705546342362266,0.006080707573244887,0.00552791597567717,0.014072494669509595,67,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would ""never"" as she told him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, ""get there in time for the Overture."" On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. ""Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,"" he had told her, ""can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission--how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed!"" In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth. Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account. When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to Meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris: ""She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you're with us? Anyhow, I'll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me."" If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compiegne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the forest--after which they went on to the Chateau of Pierrefonds. ""To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations."" But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds--alas, without allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said, that would ""create a dreadful impression,""--he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines. So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compiegne. It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: ""What, you here?"" and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him. ""So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!"" she would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go. He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compiegne and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Chateau, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;--innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided heart. ""We mustn't, on any account,"" he would warn M. de Forestelle, ""run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them."" And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compiegne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: ""No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is there."" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of Compiegne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with photographs of the Chateau of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit. The front-door bell rang.",3.6143877844441223,1.3517591919390994,0.4262500230554172,0.06599322633137056,4.269269776876268,4.0,2.2885216877835637,36.51851851851852,29.5,28.501943235077547,1.2606490872210954,1.0,0.6109325035706032,1972,663,0.33620689655172414,8788,54,73.33640133250411,7.072849570452931e+31,3.0565469189511368e+28,0.7799076544788649,0.7693110829075942,63.11779092479907,13.52788145143115,11.502022097120243,16.960348583877998,16.93751990834648,8.492758620689653,52.69498910675381,5.907407407407407,True,1315.0,0.8578219533275713,3.797752808988764,2314.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0076364313652449245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010430247718383311,0.006705159247532129,0.001955671447196871,0.0056179775280898875,68,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"There seemed some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep. As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments as these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets. But their faces--a collective and formless mass--escaped the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried out: ""Heaven help me!"" as people, after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily life--when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed--by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Laperouse. Sometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood; at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In Swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead for twenty years. Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited--at Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of the Ministries--he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which--while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray--seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incoherents, to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect, made Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)--in these words, which Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: ""Can't you wait a minute for me? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me."" It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann: ""Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and he's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you only knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no one that really knows you, is there, except me?"" And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: ""I feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with them on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at least be polite,"" or ""Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm going to make you work, I can tell you,"" which proved that Odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his. And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her--and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves were,",3.764715550479675,1.3001228794981468,0.4099534823326626,0.06450885050999303,4.318737270875764,4.0,2.317303025904352,47.90243902439025,34.0,53.10082672547772,1.2830957230142566,1.0,0.6336614811639032,1964,679,0.34572301425661917,8845,41,69.42028143019112,1.4087864222903778e+30,6.1599756112390804e+26,0.8125553950667381,0.8188145741438254,49.664126223237815,18.232480751080427,12.73818426895117,21.523501068004574,22.862472058019968,8.976252545824849,65.06129849485868,8.21951219512195,True,1288.0,0.8692610406646262,3.8675120244862264,2287.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0031496062992125984,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00666975451597962,0.005094951366373321,0.0036127836961556276,0.004809794490599038,69,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"order to make allowance for different eventualities--from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him. Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness. And if--instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him, without having seen him again--he were to send her this money, if he were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy--the sight of her face--which he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:--this other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it. And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile. So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which he set most store. Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see her again. Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested. Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief, again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old. But at other times--when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday--it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,--by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday--suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),--and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities. It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to himself--or so, at least, he believed--that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an Odette almost unknown. But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send",4.359150167436944,1.3691465175726267,0.43959361713558165,0.06309899336140644,4.321283095723015,4.0,2.359306912470169,61.375,50.0,46.26807079401517,1.2968431771894093,1.0,0.6453422447671839,1964,620,0.31568228105906315,8779,32,68.9593921706081,8.885533224167206e+29,3.964985820690409e+26,0.8937325169963222,0.900571209192276,34.82644220977599,23.648999490835035,14.191785591663535,26.99399185336049,29.610743380855403,9.12686354378819,79.09394093686355,10.875,True,1309.0,0.8786256135653726,3.917447568049978,2241.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012862335725603505,0.00540590921800727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011930282412153975,0.005592319880697176,0.0,0.0035698348951361,71,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took shape and grew solid before his eyes, and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been Odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on--like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his longing,--a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity. And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest--as he had several times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then was. After these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning, would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet. But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine that Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away, solitary, crushed,--she must have employed, to draw Forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: ""Do look at him, storming!"" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'. At such times Swann detested her. ""But I've been a fool, too,"" he would argue. ""I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!"" And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out--as he tried to convince himself--that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter. The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would be a bar to his. Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours. But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: ""Look at him storming!"" began to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who also turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: ""You mustn't stay long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!"" that same smile with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone. Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities. Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire. What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own. He returned to the other point of view--opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in",3.472090626943901,1.4604714430703434,0.4290267653282669,0.07589806867012597,4.310045894951555,4.0,2.3090505581949885,40.854166666666664,32.5,37.27766846212652,1.2733299337072923,1.0,0.6190479586272098,1961,646,0.3294237633860275,8794,48,69.92274553638279,2.3284265675354636e+30,1.0243847635439787e+27,0.7346231837538962,0.6888818434824276,57.64430844169641,15.36841821774605,12.124030204009365,18.768999660037395,19.29739949855516,8.81854156042835,57.32535483596804,6.729166666666667,True,1314.0,0.8710954685437747,3.8688957325120987,2273.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009307520476545048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00781831720029784,0.0029784065524944155,0.0,0.010558732952045754,70,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"her money was only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came, now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable, or indeed possible. Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge. When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded complexion, returned on certain days. ""Really, I am making distinct headway,"" he would tell himself on the morrow, ""when I come to think it over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought her ugly."" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed, no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, ""It is she!"" as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. ""She?""--he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp--the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation. By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they were, the strawberries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, ""every fruit visited and examined, one by one, by myself."" And in the sequel, by the cordiality with which the Princess thanked him, he had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripeness of the pears. But, most of all, that ""every fruit visited and examined one by one, by myself"" had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying his mind off to a region which he rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art of ordering things from shops. Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times--when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up' with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann. But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Francoise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,--since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins' 'faithful,'--when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily. If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say,",4.0361653855989,0.9488978366120194,0.4250161168971987,0.037026894731200875,4.354920958694543,4.0,2.381615696588326,67.62068965517241,49.0,53.494707307071074,1.2916879143294238,1.0,0.6295277659157966,1961,693,0.35339112697603264,8870,29,71.28303206772449,9.074599780926618e+30,4.008215450939319e+27,0.8903310064758573,0.8844137368378816,28.923202447730773,26.023986354604443,14.701392906051431,29.4756088554397,32.892022543037505,9.369199388067308,85.51972076175069,12.10344827586207,True,1243.0,0.8710247349823321,3.9178445229681977,2264.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019870609981515713,0.017282809611829944,0.007208872458410351,0.007208872458410351,0.007208872458410351,0.0,0.007855822550831794,0.0044362292051756,0.0,0.00441696113074205,72,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"""I am always free"" and ""What can it matter to me, what other people think?"" now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: ""Ah, he! He is not in the least like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his friendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public."" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, _a priori_, the axiom of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. ""I should like to speak to you about her,"" he went on, ""you, who know what a woman supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see Odette in the light in which you and I have been privileged to see her. And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerates the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her?"" My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's _Septennat_, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the Cote d'Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: ""You do look sad!"" It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Crecy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies' men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: ""What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Crecy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true, are always based upon other people's ideas""; he would reflect that this legend--even if it were authentic--was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: ""So that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!"" Sometimes, at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew--if only indirectly--the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was",3.5765683997662845,1.045037961655524,0.4228851923178297,0.05684464205950691,4.220183486238532,4.0,2.210493085469792,41.744680851063826,30.0,37.76267891073361,1.2522935779816513,1.0,0.615843602683257,1962,669,0.3409785932721712,8607,47,68.52603673366283,5.7607578477065456e+29,2.5411371185295747e+26,0.842610228644765,0.8352826370133294,58.520112238922536,15.46748975209838,11.947809125393459,18.981256642158456,19.3194046457154,8.305606523955145,56.37261153404038,6.1063829787234045,True,1277.0,0.8698720776356418,3.7966475518306133,2267.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004167850715165293,0.00312588803637397,0.0,0.00176444640494045,73,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,"" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: ""You know, you will never be like other people!""--she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: ""He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!"" and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh: ""I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!"" But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: ""Ah! so you never will be like other people!"" She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child whose family one has known: ""He's not positively ugly, if you like, but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!"" realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold's), and would say: ""Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of yours."" Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only Odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling himself greedily upon her words: ""You can if you like,"" he would tell her. And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. ""If she didn't love me, just a little,"" he told himself, ""she would not wish to have me altered. To alter me, she will have to see me more often."" And so he was able to trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: ""Don't have him again when you come to me,"" just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to him: ""I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and she certainly takes an interest in what I do."" And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said: ""Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?"" with what melancholy joy would Swann answer him: ""Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I go to the Rue La Perouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she thinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to take Remi there; I should never hear the last of it!"" These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it, he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: ""There was a time when Odette loved me more,"" but he never formed any definite picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said: ""Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back,"" and ""At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,"" so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days. But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party. It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season, of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with: ""You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me--you know what I feel about you!"" His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La Perouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac's 'tigers'--now 'grooms'--. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him. One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions, tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction,",3.7903067210591175,1.5000816388219036,0.4007336279948327,0.05687163712273479,4.129081632653061,4.0,2.161153125086421,40.0,30.0,31.349901539408577,1.2270408163265305,1.0,0.5411471360210857,1960,664,0.33877551020408164,8495,49,71.504320269684,1.132222354658457e+31,4.9141595254273305e+27,0.8159811596075693,0.7981985648895832,62.42734693877554,14.489081632653065,10.336758426978903,17.591836734693878,18.017974489795918,7.738999999999997,55.1530612244898,6.061224489795919,True,1328.0,0.8624131944444444,3.6870659722222223,2304.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02048827190043083,0.004595500239348971,0.004595500239348971,0.004595500239348971,0.0,0.0,0.004021062709430349,0.0042125418860698895,0.003446625179511728,0.0030381944444444445,75,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations. ""But what do you mean, my dear Meme, I don't quite understand.... You didn't go straight from her house to the Musee Grevin? Surely you went somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing you are, my dear Meme. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange. After all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear Meme; I'm exceedingly fond of you."" Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, ""I saw Mme. de Crecy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.""), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,--how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: ""She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul."" How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery. Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: ""This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic."" After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle. And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him. Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to ""the day when I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,"" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, ""Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,"" he remembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an ""Oh, no! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance."" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: ""That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,"" that explanation would set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely. It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: ""My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write."" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying ""my"" and ""mine"" when she referred to him: ""You are",2.9741077967640495,1.2881797433231585,0.42379653386049176,0.07035358434989401,4.314417177914111,4.0,2.2953711574161524,32.0655737704918,22.0,30.800717924600193,1.266359918200409,1.0,0.625884438679848,1956,649,0.331799591002045,8789,61,68.32917857030705,4.731351416737009e+29,2.0760646848341417e+26,0.7259758172556758,0.7084826713080629,67.15439354319624,11.858620805256631,11.141647946200631,15.28021723825807,14.923691793221359,8.64566462167689,49.19236313654497,5.491803278688525,True,1293.0,0.8657305835892936,3.856516015796402,2279.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023652109134928764,0.0040972157556569515,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007821957351708726,0.0072632461123009594,0.003910978675854363,0.00307152259763054,74,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity. A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race--if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams--fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the 'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to the old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate), scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall which--just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides--displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith--an allegory of alarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot--to be looking out, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart. He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,--instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged--were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Breaute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Breaute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments. ""Hallo! you here! why, it's ages since I've seen you,"" the General greeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, ""You're looking well, old man!"" while M. de Breaute turned with, ""My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?"" to a 'society novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':--""I am observing!"" The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Cande, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair. Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from _Orfeo_ which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds') which came after the flute, and followed",4.52773052788659,1.6407118404204593,0.4397073418685926,0.06593820529089513,4.567676767676768,4.0,2.496859776600543,86.08695652173913,64.0,66.46405569503632,1.3333333333333333,1.0,0.6963106238227914,1980,839,0.42373737373737375,9391,23,73.06535810579214,5.393638604717254e+31,2.3511938119953157e+28,0.8453887394544753,0.7959568142181351,6.656739130434815,33.71724637681159,17.62055109306203,37.42468159859464,43.12723583662714,10.714101010101007,108.00614844093104,18.869565217391305,True,1140.0,0.8714036617262424,4.0937227550130775,2294.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0033506745436910324,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01269729300767128,0.0021162155012785467,0.0,0.011333914559721011,76,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: ""It isn't possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!""; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head--transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely ""I can't help it"") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with anger--and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there--a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, ""After all, it isn't for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is."" And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as ""at my cousins the Guermantes's,"" ""at my aunt Guermantes's,"" ""Elzear de Guermantes's health,"" ""my cousin Guermantes's box."" If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests. At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision--so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due--to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she called 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately--with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish--to clutch at one's heart. Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having 'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead.

"her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured ""How charming it is!"" with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: ""How is your husband?"" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: ""Why; he's never been better in his life!"" And she went on laughing. Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's health, said to her cousin: ""Oriane,"" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) ""I should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your opinion of it."" She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just as though it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge. ""But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now--that I adore it."" ""You know, my husband isn't at all well; it's his liver. He would like so much to see you,"" Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work of charity for the Princess to appear at her party. The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away--by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother, by an invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country--from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty 'Guermantes set'--in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from Merimee, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and Halevy--she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come. ""Listen, and I'll explain,"" she began to Mme. de Gallardon. ""To-morrow evening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can't possibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the house, I know there won't be anyone else there, so I can slip away."" ""Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?"" ""No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must catch his eye."" ""It's a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte's,"" Mme. de Gallardon went on. ""Oh, I know he's very clever,"" meaning by that 'very cunning,' ""but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the sister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops."" ""I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,"" said the Princesse des Laumes. ""I know he's a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones, that it's all just a pretence; is that true, d'you think?"" ""I can throw no light at all on the matter."" The pianist, who was 'down' to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile. ""Oriane, don't be angry with me,"" resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable, ""people do say about your M. Swann that he's the sort of man one can't have in the house; is that true?"" ""Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it's true,"" replied the Princesse des Laumes, ""for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he's never been to your house once."" And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after her father-in-law, who was ill. ""My dear Princess, you here?"" ""Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I've been hearing such lovely things."" ""What, you've been in the room quite a time?"" ""Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long because I couldn't see you."" Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined it with: ""Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn't matter in the least where I sit."" And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: ""There now, that hassock, that's all I want. It will make me keep my back straight. Oh! Good heavens, I'm making a noise again; they'll be telling you to have me 'chucked out'."" Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each _fortissimo_, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole. ""Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?"" asked General de Froberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her for a moment. ""Odd, wasn't it? Is she one of the performers?"" ""No, she's a little Mme. de Cambremer,"" replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: ""I am only repeating",3.229369687487369,1.2174080618197791,0.3976437762490131,0.07281477627756955,4.292174796747967,4.0,2.325298246876252,28.52173913043478,20.0,24.960611693343175,1.296239837398374,1.0,0.6368958059849934,1968,689,0.35010162601626016,8911,69,75.88802793142278,9.073018013786436e+32,3.8282776429478636e+29,0.7415430151364383,0.7047562769322253,68.22354453870629,10.829108342170375,10.909920119957178,14.010321668434077,13.04701285790032,8.400182926829263,45.64572287027218,4.884057971014493,True,1234.0,0.8459915611814346,3.759915611814346,2370.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03066016020624252,0.012153577018690728,0.004603627658594973,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008102384679127153,0.01031212595525274,0.015652334039222907,0.012658227848101266,78,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"what I heard just now, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the country, but I don't believe anyone knows them, really. They must be 'country cousins'! By the way, I don't know whether you're particularly 'well-up' in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I've no idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do with themselves when they're not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's parties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food. 'Universal providers,' you know. You must admit, they're rather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire the same 'supers' every week? It isn't possible!"" ""Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,"" protested the General. ""I see no objection to its being old,"" the Princess answered dryly, ""but whatever else it is it's not euphonious,"" she went on, isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to which the Guermantes set were addicted. ""You think not, eh! She's a regular little peach, though,"" said the General, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. ""Don't you agree with me, Princess?"" ""She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman, that's not very nice--for I don't suppose she's my generation,"" replied Mme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half wishing to oblige the General: ""Not very nice... for her husband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I might have introduced you to her,"" said the Princess, who, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort. ""And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,"" she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her appearance. ""Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I've been here, he's gone to see those friends of his--you know them too, I'm sure,--who are called after a bridge--oh, yes, the Ienas."" ""It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!"" said the General. ""I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,"" he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, ""that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes."" ""But I have the deepest respect for heroes,"" the Princess assented, though with a faint trace of irony. ""If I don't go with Basin to see this Princesse d'Iena, it isn't for that, at all; it's simply because I don't know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it's not what you think; he's not in love with her. I've nothing to set my face against! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?"" she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. ""Anyhow, it isn't that at all. They're people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he's told me about their house; it's quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their furniture is 'Empire'!"" ""But, my dear Princess, that's only natural; it belonged to their grandparents."" ""I don't quite say it didn't, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. I quite understand that people can't always have nice things, but at least they needn't have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous style--cabinets covered all over with swans' heads, like bath-taps!"" ""But I believe, all the same, that they've got some lovely things; why, they must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of..."" ""Oh, I don't deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view. But things like that can't, ever, be beautiful ... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that myself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they're up in the attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that's not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but--I don't know them! D'you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know."" She assumed a tone of childish gravity. ""And so I am just doing what I was taught to do. Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception."" And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression. ""My dear Princess, you know that they'd be simply wild with joy."" ""No, why?"" she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so. ""Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if they're anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people I do know; I'm sure if I had to see people I didn't know as well, even if they had 'fought like heroes,' I should go stark mad. Besides, except when it's an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in society. It's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one's arm to Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big 'crushes.' And as I never give any..."" ""Ah! Princess, it's easy to see you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it, all right, the 'wit of the Guermantes'!"" ""But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could make out why. Do you really know any others who have it?"" she rallied him, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches--even if the Princess had to make them herself--as were in praise of her wit or of her beauty. ""Look, there's Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don't you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!"" ""Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?"" asked the General. ""My precious Charles? Ah, he's coming at last; I was beginning to think he didn't want to see me!"" Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous--with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess--a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country: ""Ah!"" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, ""Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess."" ""What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too wonderful! I never knew; I'm quite bewildered,"" Mme. de Saint-Euverte protested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann's way of speaking. And then, examining the Princess's headdress, ""Why, you're quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,--oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't tell me, even."" Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing. ""Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you also her neighbour in the country?"" Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann, had drifted away. ""But you are, yourself, Princess!"" ""I! Why, they must have 'countries' everywhere, those creatures! Don't I wish I had!"" ""No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due."" ""I don't know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I'm 'touched' for a hundred francs, every year, by the Cure, which is a due that I could very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!"" she said with a laugh. ""It begins no better."" Swann took the point. ""Yes; that double abbreviation!"" ""Some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first word."" ""But since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second, he'd have done better to finish the first and be",2.86450655067837,1.0492789262710538,0.38668813954330145,0.08730008851588718,4.174530695078641,4.0,2.2225222142517933,18.771428571428572,13.0,17.39636368290095,1.2364282090309489,1.0,0.5562360161185053,1971,621,0.3150684931506849,8932,105,84.08334444987757,3.288005342668944e+36,1.302696253038409e+33,0.681281485236608,0.6793055196554916,83.18017351598175,6.3207100094223385,8.476518816588055,9.375643980575488,7.617753859534684,7.1693759512937625,34.245807059505694,2.9047619047619047,True,1348.0,0.8125990491283677,3.5388272583201266,2524.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03179562580408013,0.01911413343135453,0.008821907737548245,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004962323102370888,0.006432641058628928,0.007167800036757949,0.011489698890649762,79,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"done with it. We are indulging in the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of taste--but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,"" she went on in a coaxing tone, ""I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only when I see you that I stop feeling bored."" Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life--the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette. ""Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear friend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could spend a most pleasant evening together."" ""I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but I must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror of 'picturesque spots'."" ""I know it well, it's delightful!"" replied Swann. ""It's almost too beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to be happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's edge... I should be quite wretched!"" ""Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there's that appalling Rampillon woman; she's seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what it was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she's just married off her daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),--perhaps both--to each other! Oh, no, I remember now, she's been dropped by her Prince... Pretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha'n't come and invite me to dinner. Anyhow, I'm going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you off and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me there. If one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from Meme... Remember, I never see you at all now!"" Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the risk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme's, of missing a message which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter, at home. ""Poor Swann,"" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; ""he is always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even interesting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!"" she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus. Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape, General de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme. de Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her. ""I say, Swann, I'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages, what do you say?"" The words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation. ""Ah!"" he began, ""some fine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La Perouse..."" (and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). ""He was a fine character, and interests me very much, does La Perouse,"" he ended sadly. ""Oh, yes, of course, La Perouse,"" said the General. ""It's quite a well-known name. There's a street called that."" ""Do you know anyone in the Rue La Perouse?"" asked Swann excitedly. ""Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That's a house that will be really smart some day, you'll see!"" ""Oh, so she lives in the Rue La Perouse. It's attractive; I like that street; it's so sombre."" ""Indeed it isn't. You can't have been in it for a long time; it's not at all sombre now; they're beginning to build all round there."" When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune. ""It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,"" said the General, alluding to the incident of the candle. Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent. But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: ""It is the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!"", all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness. In place of the abstract expressions ""the time when I was happy,"" ""the time when I was loved,"" which he had often used until then, and without much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address 'Maison Doree,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read ""My hand trembles so as I write to you,"" the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly: ""You won't let it be very long before you send for me?""; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and",3.0650125189758652,1.0460968945799964,0.3996988963601513,0.0799362083959281,4.241203467618562,4.0,2.300357017256587,29.71212121212121,17.0,37.0759928662148,1.2595614482406936,1.0,0.6071489886039656,1961,700,0.35696073431922487,8777,66,73.50899950021437,8.405292923879309e+31,3.587406284199449e+28,0.7600676357746124,0.7557729901745915,70.1182984485343,10.86055236196746,10.63711953065702,14.21019269698515,13.402128938544031,8.142049974502804,46.234303772039624,4.909090909090909,True,1274.0,0.8553137003841229,3.746052069995732,2343.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029644821478512166,0.008949380068984806,0.005220471706907803,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008949380068984806,0.005593362543115503,0.001957676890090426,0.006828851899274435,80,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: ""But I can see you at any time; I am always free!""--she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour--of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements--of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: ""But why don't you let me come to you oftener?"" he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. ""Written from the Hotel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?"" He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was himself. When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that other self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said, without much suffering: ""Perhaps she's in love with them,"" now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the 'letter-heading' of the Maison d'Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares. There are in the music of the violin--if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound--accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message. As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form. He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it--without his being touched by them himself--carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once it had said of his happiness: ""What does all that matter; it is all nothing."" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown, exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation? When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, 'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers--provided only that they were in any sense musical--who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical _motifs_ as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the _Princesse de Cleves_, or of _Rene_, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our",3.86723717298436,1.7200300536080109,0.41233375160020647,0.05982832848530966,4.343511450381679,4.0,2.3475535173973054,50.38461538461539,45.0,44.34920597943009,1.2961832061068703,1.0,0.6513330913995249,1965,689,0.35063613231552165,8867,39,72.10745787032936,2.069526811182108e+31,9.080854809925879e+27,0.818456655270175,0.7991562356819978,46.03751614797417,19.354961832061075,13.875232112747142,22.963006459189668,24.220246623605398,9.152366412213734,68.14542963397926,8.948717948717949,True,1274.0,0.8652917946467749,3.8907415533128566,2279.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008874919108810206,0.01257280207081446,0.0,0.00307152259763054,81,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase, like some theme, say, in _Tristan_, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain. So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand. The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's pianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. ""Audacity,"" he exclaimed to himself, ""as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!"" How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the violinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: ""It's astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it..."" But a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added the reservation: ""anything to beat it... since the table-turning!"" From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as significant facts of infinite value: ""Yesterday he went through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,""--although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go. He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there--for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain--was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position--his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)--his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem--and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving,",3.4970734088426054,1.1471967543006956,0.43921499769970135,0.06317150382410333,4.435936702399183,4.0,2.3618230878260995,36.9622641509434,26.0,30.841629710109473,1.3175089331291476,1.0,0.6673717979424654,1959,736,0.37570188871873406,8985,53,68.97051953779729,8.984957956897307e+29,4.012933433183255e+26,0.8132057407727609,0.8195059474776772,57.85704614406657,14.37188842979187,12.28026645828114,17.56183266395061,17.94439394377185,9.48249106687085,55.492126325522264,6.849056603773585,True,1236.0,0.8780705672175079,4.012952210808397,2239.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004023776863283036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008779149519890261,0.004663923182441701,0.0,0.004912907548012505,82,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette--he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: ""People don't know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they are."" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams--his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed. Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's very life. Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would, perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile: ""Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He's going to Egypt!"" and Swann had at once understood that this meant: ""I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville."" And, in fact, if, a few days later, Swann began: ""About that trip that you told me you were going to take with Forcheville,"" she would answer carelessly: ""Yes, my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the Pyramids."" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her. One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Breaute and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort, answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking in that either, and his relations with Swann--cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found in talking together--were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. ""It is not for nothing,"" he now assured himself, ""that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour. He may have acted dishonourably once again."" Then he suspected Remi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths--which no strange eye might explore--of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to",3.5667421576580853,0.9686907317030871,0.4191511976343688,0.0662138327243022,4.435714285714286,4.0,2.4159229444395343,36.9811320754717,27.0,29.044202205212542,1.311734693877551,1.0,0.6602914098632452,1960,687,0.35051020408163264,9067,53,68.83501413187581,7.846334146765921e+29,3.4413746257745266e+26,0.8266762174092807,0.8028941960895762,58.32639584135542,14.311110897189064,12.578212117618286,17.75163650365807,17.952780323450135,9.481591836734694,56.87909125914517,7.3584905660377355,True,1237.0,0.8675438596491228,3.976754385964912,2280.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012707633657075428,0.009621494054642825,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010801488608514114,0.008259961877099029,0.004084596532631388,0.010526315789473684,83,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"you the least ill-will in the world, Odette,"" he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness. ""I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a great deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger with you is never due to your actions--I can and do forgive you everything because I love you--but to your untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done those things."" ""How on earth can I tell?"" she was furious. ""Perhaps I have, ever so long ago, when I didn't know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times."" Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead, since those words ""two or three times"" carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that those words, ""two or three times,"" nothing more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: ""I have never seen anything to beat it since the table-turning."" The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words ""perhaps two or three times,"" was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done ""two or three times"" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the possession--as if that were ever possible--of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much--as it ordinarily was--in Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La Perouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe. ""My darling,"" he began again, ""it's all over now; was it with anyone I know?"" ""No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really went as far as that."" He smiled, and resumed with: ""Just as you like. It doesn't really matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't bother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I've quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?"" ""Oh, Charles! can't you see, you're killing me? It's all ever so long ago. I've never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd be a lot better off!"" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice. ""I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom, Odette, my love."" ""But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with the Princesse des Laumes,"" she added, happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. ""At the next table there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to me, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired, and I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,' I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after."" Odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and: ""You are a fiend!"" she flung at him, ""you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace."" This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered, which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the ""rock there,""... He could hear her answer--alas, how lightheartedly--""I've heard that tale before!"" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time, then said to her: ""My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you dreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again."" But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting--of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it--that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: ""Life is indeed astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have suspected."" But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things",3.2189334712311184,1.1053231889408317,0.39053254503452955,0.07098215090896234,4.179643765903308,4.0,2.2499743567253594,23.963414634146343,17.5,18.282635452034288,1.2631043256997456,1.0,0.6132444330470699,1965,646,0.3287531806615776,8687,82,76.48915118469804,1.6550696886606032e+33,7.036860921176034e+29,0.7783948057963525,0.7769717637449503,75.65350819214301,8.660362750574073,9.775699323035472,11.844907838391363,10.237829454477755,7.541089058524175,39.43415254763235,3.707317073170732,True,1333.0,0.8520408163265306,3.693452380952381,2352.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.032245934003948484,0.022374729717025477,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00658080285794867,0.005640688163956003,0.008461032245934004,0.0021258503401360546,85,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"judge one's fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals--would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail--insignificant but true--which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played, the sight of the title--_Les Filles de Marbre_, by Theodore Barriere,--struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word 'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at the Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, ""Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of marble."" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words, _Filles de Marbre_, and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he recoiled again in horror. The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Breaute, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Breaute, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Breaute, there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their own innocence), who--as, for instance, Odette,--would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years before: ""Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me. I'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name."" So far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love expire. Suddenly he made up his mind. ""Odette, my darling,"" he began, ""I know, I am being simply odious, but I must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?"" She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore them to go, when some one has asked, ""Are you coming to watch the procession go by?"", or ""Will you be at the review?"". But this shake of the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite possibly true. ""I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,"" she added, seeming angry and uncomfortable. ""Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You know quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.'"" She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: ""I have never done anything of that sort with any woman."" ""Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?"" Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that. ""Oh, you do make me so miserable,"" she cried, with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. ""Have you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!"" However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it. ""You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear",3.1882585459147514,1.1241029082401197,0.4099057736008326,0.06399546345432115,4.329243353783231,4.0,2.435881997219512,27.942857142857143,21.0,24.68480487742884,1.3026584867075666,1.0,0.6808910076879163,1956,666,0.34049079754601225,8826,70,73.02410205134169,5.175646032335847e+31,2.263072161056339e+28,0.7748192203217659,0.7620731543968705,68.26809202453988,10.679084428863572,11.236945644806024,14.060578439964942,12.932164767747587,8.596646216768917,45.42751971954426,4.885714285714286,True,1262.0,0.8587669435942282,3.859204197638828,2287.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.019116555308092056,0.010207869339272457,0.010207869339272457,0.010207869339272457,0.010207869339272457,0.010207869339272457,0.005567928730512249,0.007238307349665924,0.0,0.009619588981198076,84,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: ""I knew quite well what she was after."" ""Two or three times."" ""I've heard that tale before."" But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: ""I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,"" ""I've heard that tale before,"" but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile: ""You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!"" By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's _Journal d'un Poete_ which he had previously read without emotion: ""When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her surroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies in the answer."" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, ""I've heard that tale before,"" or ""I knew quite well what she was after,"" could cause him so much pain. But he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,--indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence--whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed, would make it break out again in another form. But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind, with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying--without hurting Odette--to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden--a dead weight, but none the less disturbing--of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever. ""Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,"" her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. ""There was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any money I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll kill myself if you don't bring her to me'--meaning me! They told her I'd gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I shouted fit to bring the house down:--'But when you hear me say that I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all! I should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear. There's some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say such dreadful things about her."" Besides, her very admissions--when she made any--of faults which she supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like corpses in a river. And they poisoned it. She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fete. ""What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,"" he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fete, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore that she had not. ""Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,"" he pursued, hoping to frighten her. ""Yes, that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Prevost's,"" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. ""It's quite true, I hadn't been to the Maison Doree. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I had, really, been to Prevost's--that wasn't a story--and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don't you see? I admit, I did wrong,",3.1352231338722154,1.228140440546398,0.42645047263427704,0.08219223014927905,4.193976518631955,4.0,2.194509009368617,27.591549295774648,21.0,22.506072710877127,1.2363450740173558,1.0,0.5677985710796066,1959,643,0.3282286881061766,8658,71,70.50653897453901,4.1744649095748467e+30,1.8094776374403323e+27,0.7700383749125259,0.7674455516364264,74.23478420292045,9.759576098756913,9.840742249862611,13.037640647355289,12.11940405064383,7.787789688616641,42.49711335907225,4.112676056338028,True,1316.0,0.8647594278283485,3.752925877763329,2307.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.029034690799396683,0.026583710407239818,0.0222473604826546,0.0222473604826546,0.019230769230769232,0.0,0.005184766214177979,0.006787330316742082,0.003110859728506787,0.006935413957520589,86,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"but at least I'm telling you all about it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie Fete, if it were true? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?"" He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so, even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had ""done a cattleya"") when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Doree, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: ""I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: ""I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse."" And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La Perouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Doree, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Doree it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Doree, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion. On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must instantly accompany her home, to ""do a cattleya,"" and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase, with ""I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!"" And he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses. Sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about Odette, although he dared not mention her name. ""I have a little thing here, you're sure to like,"" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young and attractive, said to him once, ""Of course, what I should like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go with any other men again."" ""Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with her, and never to be unfaithful to him?"" asked Swann anxiously. ""Why, surely! It all depends on their characters!"" Swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a smile: ""But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with your sash."" ""And you too, you've got blue cuffs on."" ""What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring you, am I; or keeping you?"" ""No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk."" ""I am highly flattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?"" he asked the 'manageress,' who had just looked in. ""Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to myself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other day, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal, I call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,"" she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to interest him. She did not know Odette. The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the 'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled 'Luxembourg,' and having some business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose 'day' it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which would do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon. ""I needn't ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that the whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It's the same in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but Machard's portrait; you aren't smart, you aren't really cultured, you aren't up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard's portrait."" Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission. ""Oh, that's quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite frank about it. You don't consider yourself disgraced because you haven't seen Machard's portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it's just ideal. Of course, she's not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend Biche paints. That's quite clear. But I must tell you, perfectly frankly (you'll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always say just what I think), that I don't understand his work. I can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear",3.095474348873484,0.9615339683542198,0.4027976229697583,0.05873384262396074,4.301174068402246,4.0,2.2548577586653917,27.208333333333332,19.0,28.119752596904387,1.257784583971414,1.0,0.5851744961649795,1959,690,0.35222052067381315,8900,72,75.43162225848391,5.748271969936703e+32,2.434676819117621e+29,0.7790325842273067,0.7764143305165427,72.80996586268508,9.863108090862685,9.827888789773866,12.90477284328739,12.432696528841248,8.403001531393567,44.410987748851454,4.680555555555555,True,1268.0,0.8462515883100381,3.7695891571368065,2361.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022857142857142857,0.018801843317972352,0.015299539170506913,0.015299539170506913,0.015299539170506913,0.015299539170506913,0.007741935483870968,0.004423963133640553,0.004700460829493088,0.009318085556967387,87,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"me, yes; and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the Doctor's colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she's got something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that she'd rather have Leloir. I'm only a wretched Philistine, and I've no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when it's going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know what I mean."" Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of speaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these. ""Your ears must have been burning,"" she ventured, ""while we were on the yacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time."" Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins' presence. ""You see,"" Mme. Cottard went on, ""Mme. de Crecy was there; need I say more? When Odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking about you. And you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says. What! you don't believe me!"" she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends: ""Why, she _adores_ you! No, indeed; I'm sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one's place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for instance, she would say, 'If only we had him here, he's the man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not. There's no one like him for that.' And all day long she would be saying, 'What can he be doing just now? I do hope, he's doing a little work! It's too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.' (Forgive me, won't you.) 'I can see him this very moment; he's thinking of us, he's wondering where we are.' Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, 'How in the world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?' And Odette answered, 'Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.' ""No, I assure you, I'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. I can tell you, besides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'I don't say that Odette isn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann might say.' Oh, mercy, there's the conductor stopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?"" And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transfer-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went. To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal, feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness. In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered--though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy--and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished--in thought at least--to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: ""I must go."" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those",3.2257968810442668,1.4270139459983604,0.4137300484879846,0.06991325907210298,4.172782874617737,4.0,2.1430049550246584,31.142857142857142,17.0,37.481363471860924,1.2186544342507646,1.0,0.5203294493242316,1962,661,0.33690112130479105,8595,63,73.34223313623522,7.114217548688955e+31,3.066473081331446e+28,0.738040046345803,0.7404278663338207,72.12683486238535,10.93583660987331,9.278547400647748,13.945420125236637,13.795235910878112,7.7855045871559625,46.38240862094073,4.746031746031746,True,1308.0,0.8603448275862069,3.7047413793103448,2320.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01422475106685633,0.004551920341394026,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008060692271218587,0.007396870554765292,0.005120910384068279,0.008620689655172414,88,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. ""They had obviously arranged it between them,"" he added; ""they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress."" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. ""After all, she is quite right,"" he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease. ""I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her."" So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the 'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped with a fez. As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: ""Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire."" It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:-- ""Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour."" But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer--Mlle. Legrandin that had been--was spending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again--and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Froberville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,--the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish--were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity. But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which--in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her--he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: ""To think that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my style!"" Among the rooms which used most commonly to take shape in my mind during my long nights of sleeplessness, there was none that differed more utterly from the rooms at Combray, thickly powdered with the motes of an atmosphere granular, pollenous, edible and instinct with piety, than my room in the Grand Hotel de la Plage, at Balbec, the walls of which, washed with ripolin, contained, like the polished sides of a basin in which the water glows with a blue, lurking fire, a finer air, pure, azure-tinted, saline. The Bavarian upholsterer who had been entrusted with the furnishing of this hotel had varied his scheme of decoration in different rooms, and in that which I found myself occupying had set against the walls, on three sides of it, a series of low book-cases with glass fronts, in which, according to where they stood, by a law of nature which he had, perhaps, forgotten to take into account, was reflected this or that section of the ever-changing view of the sea, so that the walls were lined with a frieze of seascapes, interrupted only by the polished mahogany of the actual shelves. And so effective was this that the whole room had the appearance of one of those model bedrooms which you see nowadays in Housing Exhibitions, decorated with works of art which are calculated by their designer to refresh the eyes of whoever may ultimately have to sleep in the rooms, the subjects being kept in some degree of harmony with the locality and surroundings of the houses for which the rooms are planned. And yet nothing could have differed more utterly, either, from the real Balbec than that other Balbec of which I had often dreamed, on stormy days, when the wind was so strong that Francoise, as she took me to the Champs-Elysees, would warn me not to walk too near the side of the street, or I might have my head knocked off by a falling slate, and would recount to me, with many lamentations, the terrible disasters and shipwrecks that were reported in the newspaper. I longed for nothing more than to behold a storm at sea, less as a mighty spectacle than as a momentary revelation of the true life of nature; or rather there were for me no mighty spectacles save those which I knew to be not artificially composed for my entertainment, but necessary and unalterable,--the beauty of landscapes or of great works of art. I was not curious, I did not thirst to know anything save what I believed to be more genuine than myself, what had for me the supreme merit of shewing me a fragment of the mind of a great genius, or of the force or the grace of nature as she appeared when left entirely to herself, without human interference. Just as the lovely sound of her voice, reproduced, all by itself, upon the phonograph, could never console a man for the loss of his mother, so a mechanical imitation of a storm would have left me as cold as did the illuminated fountains at the Exhibition. I required also, if the storm was to be absolutely genuine, that the shore from which I watched it should be a natural shore, not an embankment recently constructed by a municipality. Besides, nature, by all the feelings that she aroused in me, seemed to me the most opposite thing in the world to the mechanical inventions of mankind. The less she bore their imprint, the more room she offered for the expansion of my heart. And, as it happened, I had preserved the name of Balbec, which Legrandin had cited to us, as that of a sea-side place in the very midst of ""that funereal coast, famed for the number of its wrecks, swathed, for six months in",3.4233319233998545,1.406444060288298,0.4296063851723931,0.06583430417738212,4.374682257244535,4.0,2.4013700521381405,39.34,31.0,33.79266784377937,1.2902897813929843,1.0,0.663234718809387,1967,751,0.38179969496695476,8933,50,75.43630642579369,5.775260998801223e+32,2.5396926116100363e+29,0.8050628219332013,0.7865072066585223,57.74638449415353,14.978019420437217,12.857556352371635,18.68465277071683,18.84475343162176,9.170716827656324,57.38778851042197,7.1,True,1212.0,0.8685136323658751,3.9283201407211963,2274.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010383166406321786,0.010383166406321786,0.006891482128089681,0.004778094275475512,0.0,0.0,0.008269778553707618,0.003216024993108518,0.003583570706606634,0.010993843447669306,89,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"the year, in a shroud of fog and flying foam from the waves. ""You feel, there, below your feet still,"" he had told me, ""far more even than at Finistere (and even though hotels are now being superimposed upon it, without power, however, to modify that oldest bone in the earth's skeleton) you feel there that you are actually at the land's end of France, of Europe, of the Old World. And it is the ultimate encampment of the fishermen, precisely like the fishermen who have lived since the world's beginning, facing the everlasting kingdom of the sea-fogs and shadows of the night."" One day when, at Combray, I had spoken of this coast, this Balbec, before M. Swann, hoping to learn from him whether it was the best point to select for seeing the most violent storms, he had replied: ""I should think I did know Balbec! The church at Balbec, built in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and still half romanesque, is perhaps the most curious example to be found of our Norman gothic, and so exceptional that one is tempted to describe it as Persian in its inspiration."" And that region, which, until then, had seemed to me to be nothing else than a part of immemorial nature, that had remained contemporaneous with the great phenomena of geology--and as remote from human history as the Ocean itself, or the Great Bear, with its wild race of fishermen for whom, no more than for their whales, had there been any Middle Ages--it had been a great joy to me to see it suddenly take its place in the order of the centuries, with a stored consciousness of the romanesque epoch, and to know that the gothic trefoil had come to diversify those wild rocks also, at the appointed hour, like those frail but hardy plants which, in the Polar regions, when the spring returns, scatter their stars about the eternal snows. And if gothic art brought to those places and people a classification which, otherwise, they lacked, they too conferred one upon it in return. I tried to form a picture in my mind of how those fishermen had lived, the timid and unsuspected essay towards social intercourse which they had attempted there, clustered upon a promontory of the shores of Hell, at the foot of the cliffs of death; and gothic art seemed to me a more living thing now that, detaching it from the towns in which, until then, I had always imagined it, I could see how, in a particular instance, upon a reef of savage rocks, it had taken root and grown until it flowered in a tapering spire. I was taken to see reproductions of the most famous of the statues at Balbec,--shaggy, blunt-faced Apostles, the Virgin from the porch,--and I could scarcely breathe for joy at the thought that I might myself, one day, see them take a solid form against their eternal background of salt fog. Thereafter, on dear, tempestuous February nights, the wind--breathing into my heart, which it shook no less violently than the chimney of my bedroom, the project of a visit to Balbec--blended in me the desire for gothic architecture with that for a storm upon the sea. I should have liked to take, the very next day, the good, the generous train at one twenty-two, of which never without a palpitating heart could I read, in the railway company's bills or in advertisements of circular tours, the hour of departure: it seemed to me to cut, at a precise point in every afternoon, a most fascinating groove, a mysterious mark, from which the diverted hours still led one on, of course, towards evening, towards to-morrow morning, but to an evening and morning which one would behold, not in Paris but in one of those towns through which the train passed and among which it allowed one to choose; for it stopped at Bayeux, at Coutances, at Vitre, at Questambert, at Pontorson, at Balbec, at Lannion, at Lamballe, at Benodet, at Pont-Aven, at Quimperle, and progressed magnificently surcharged with names which it offered me, so that, among them all, I did not know which to choose, so impossible was it to sacrifice any. But even without waiting for the train next day, I could, by rising and dressing myself with all speed, leave Paris that very evening, should my parents permit, and arrive at Balbec as dawn spread westward over the raging sea, from whose driven foam I would seek shelter in that church in the Persian manner. But at the approach of the Easter holidays, when my parents had promised to let me spend them, for once, in the North of Italy, lo! in place of those dreams of tempests, by which I had been entirely possessed, not wishing to see anything but waves dashing in from all sides, mounting always higher, upon the wildest of coasts, beside churches as rugged and precipitous as cliffs, in whose towers the sea-birds would be wailing; suddenly, effacing them, taking away all their charm, excluding them because they were its opposite and could only have weakened its effect, was substituted in me the converse dream of the most variegated of springs, not the spring of Combray, still pricking with all the needle-points of the winter's frost, but that which already covered with lilies and anemones the meadows of Fiesole, and gave Florence a dazzling golden background, like those in Fra Angelico's pictures. From that moment, only sunlight, perfumes, colours, seemed to me to have any value; for this alternation of images had effected a change of front in my desire, and--as abrupt as those that occur sometimes in music,--a complete change of tone in my sensibility. Thus it came about that a mere atmospheric variation would be sufficient to provoke in me that modulation, without there being any need for me to await the return of a season. For often we find a day, in one, that has strayed from another season, and makes us live in that other, summons at once into our presence and makes us long for its peculiar pleasures, and interrupts the dreams that we were in process of weaving, by inserting, out of its turn, too early or too late, this leaf, torn from another chapter, in the interpolated calendar of Happiness. But soon it happened that, like those natural phenomena from which our comfort or our health can derive but an accidental and all too modest benefit, until the day when science takes control of them, and, producing them at will, places in our hands the power to order their appearance, withdrawn from the tutelage and independent of the consent of chance; similarly the production of these dreams of the Atlantic and of Italy ceased to depend entirely upon the changes of the seasons and of the weather. I need only, to make them reappear, pronounce the names: Balbec, Venice, Florence, within whose syllables had gradually accumulated all the longing inspired in me by the places for which they stood. Even in spring, to come in a book upon the name of Balbec sufficed to awaken in me the desire for storms at sea and for the Norman gothic; even on a stormy day the name of Florence or of Venice would awaken the desire for sunshine, for lilies, for the Palace of the Doges and for Santa Maria del Fiore. But if their names thus permanently absorbed the image that I had formed of these towns, it was only by transforming that image, by subordinating its reappearance in me to their own special laws; and in consequence of this they made it more beautiful, but at the same time more different from anything that the towns of Normandy or Tuscany could in reality be, and, by increasing the arbitrary delights of my imagination, aggravated the disenchantment that was in store for me when I set out upon my travels. They magnified the idea that I formed of certain points on the earth's surface, making them more special, and in consequence more real. I did not then represent to myself towns, landscapes, historic buildings, as pictures more or less attractive, cut out here and there of a substance that was common to them all, but looked on each of them as on an unknown thing, different from all the rest, a thing for which my soul was athirst, by the knowledge of which it would benefit. How much more individual still was the character that they assumed from being designated by names, names that were only for themselves, proper names such as people have. Words present to us little pictures of things, lucid and normal, like the pictures that are hung on the walls of schoolrooms to give children an illustration of what is meant by a carpenter's bench, a bird, an ant-hill; things chosen as typical of everything else of the same sort. But names present to us--of persons and of towns which they accustom us to regard as individual, as unique, like persons--a confused picture, which draws from the names, from the brightness or darkness of their sound, the colour in which it is uniformly painted, like one of those posters, entirely blue or entirely red, in which, on account of the limitations imposed by the process used in their reproduction, or by a whim on the designer's part, are blue or red not only the sky and the sea, but the ships and the church and the people in the streets. The name of Parma, one of the towns that I most longed to visit, after reading the _Chartreuse_, seeming to me compact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, if anyone were to speak of such or such a house in Parma, in which I should be lodged, he would give me the pleasure of thinking that I was to inhabit a dwelling that was compact and glossy, violet-tinted, soft, and that bore no relation to the houses in any other town in Italy, since I could imagine it only by the aid of that heavy syllable of the name of Parma, in which no breath of air stirred, and of all that I had made it assume of Stendhalian sweetness and the reflected hue of violets. And when I thought of Florence, it was of a town miraculously embalmed, and flower-like, since it was called the City of the Lilies, and its Cathedral, Our Lady of the Flower. As for Balbec, it was one of those names in which, as on an old piece of Norman pottery that still keeps the colour of the earth from which it was fashioned, one sees depicted still the representation of some long-abolished custom, of some feudal right, of the former condition of some place, of an obsolete way of pronouncing the language, which had shaped and wedded its incongruous syllables and which I never doubted that I should find spoken there at once, even by the inn-keeper who would pour me out coffee and milk on my arrival, taking me down to watch the turbulent sea, unchained, before the church; to whom I lent the aspect, disputatious, solemn and mediaeval, of some character in one of the old romances. Had my health definitely improved, had my parents allowed me, if not actually to go down to stay at Balbec, at least to take, just once, so as to become acquainted with the architecture and landscapes of Normandy or of Brittany, that one twenty-two train into which I had so often clambered in imagination, I should have preferred to stop, and to alight from it, at the most beautiful of its towns; but in vain might I",4.576557428248302,1.274356394119464,0.4460105712724803,0.044382051677763816,4.41632860040568,4.0,2.4269441527194933,68.0,55.0,40.933924889955904,1.3093306288032454,1.0,0.670029334085078,1972,733,0.37170385395537525,9028,29,78.52199696861476,1.2637756739292527e+34,5.555057907381331e+30,0.9197102699960981,0.9233557846811082,27.04562880324545,26.380101419878297,15.317112822102057,29.877484787018258,33.37090770791075,9.732718052738338,86.15415821501014,12.344827586206897,True,1217.0,0.8707692307692307,3.9683516483516486,2275.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014210238659136456,0.007287301876480233,0.007287301876480233,0.007287301876480233,0.007287301876480233,0.007287301876480233,0.014756786299872472,0.00437238112588814,0.004099107305520131,0.01010989010989011,90,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"compare and contrast them; how was one to choose, any more than between individual people, who are not interchangeable, between Bayeux, so lofty in its noble coronet of rusty lace, whose highest point caught the light of the old gold of its second syllable; Vitre, whose acute accent barred its ancient glass with wooden lozenges; gentle Lamballe, whose whiteness ranged from egg-shell yellow to a pearly grey; Coutances, a Norman Cathedral, which its final consonants, rich and yellowing, crowned with a tower of butter; Lannion with the rumble and buzz, in the silence of its village street, of the fly on the wheel of the coach; Questambert, Pontorson, ridiculously silly and simple, white feathers and yellow beaks strewn along the road to those well-watered and poetic spots; Benodet, a name scarcely moored that seemed to be striving to draw the river down into the tangle of its seaweeds; Pont-Aven, the snowy, rosy flight of the wing of a lightly poised coif, tremulously reflected in the greenish waters of a canal; Quimperle, more firmly attached, this, and since the Middle Ages, among the rivulets with which it babbled, threading their pearls upon a grey background, like the pattern made, through the cobwebs upon a window, by rays of sunlight changed into blunt points of tarnished silver? These images were false for another reason also; namely, that they were necessarily much simplified; doubtless the object to which my imagination aspired, which my senses took in but incompletely and without any immediate pleasure, I had committed to the safe custody of names; doubtless because I had accumulated there a store of dreams, those names now magnetised my desires; but names themselves are not very comprehensive; the most that I could do was to include in each of them two or three of the principal curiosities of the town, which would lie there side by side, without interval or partition; in the name of Balbec, as in the magnifying glasses set in those penholders which one buys at sea-side places, I could distinguish waves surging round a church built in the Persian manner. Perhaps, indeed, the enforced simplicity of these images was one of the reasons for the hold that they had over me. When my father had decided, one year, that we should go for the Easter holidays to Florence and Venice, not finding room to introduce into the name of Florence the elements that ordinarily constitute a town, I was obliged to let a supernatural city emerge from the impregnation by certain vernal scenes of what I supposed to be, in its essentials, the genius of Giotto. All the more--and because one cannot make a name extend much further in time than in space--like some of Giotto's paintings themselves which shew us at two separate moments the same person engaged in different actions, here lying on his bed, there just about to mount his horse, the name of Florence was divided into two compartments. In one, beneath an architectural dais, I gazed upon a fresco over which was partly drawn a curtain of morning sunlight, dusty, aslant, and gradually spreading; in the other (for, since I thought of names not as an inaccessible ideal but as a real and enveloping substance into which I was about to plunge, the life not yet lived, the life intact and pure which I enclosed in them, gave to the most material pleasures, to the simplest scenes, the same attraction that they have in the works of the Primitives), I moved swiftly--so as to arrive, as soon as might be, at the table that was spread for me, with fruit and a flask of Chianti--across a Ponte Vecchio heaped with jonquils, narcissi and anemones. That (for all that I was still in Paris) was what I saw, and not what was actually round about me. Even from the simplest, the most realistic point of view, the countries for which we long occupy, at any given moment, a far larger place in our true life than the country in which we may happen to be. Doubtless, if, at that time, I had paid more attention to what was in my mind when I pronounced the words ""going to Florence, to Parma, to Pisa, to Venice,"" I should have realised that what I saw was in no sense a town, but something as different from anything that I knew, something as delicious as might be for a human race whose whole existence had passed in a series of late winter afternoons, that inconceivable marvel, a morning in spring. These images, unreal, fixed, always alike, filling all my nights and days, differentiated this period in my life from those which had gone before it (and might easily have been confused with it by an observer who saw things only from without, that is to say, who saw nothing), as in an opera a fresh melody introduces a novel atmosphere which one could never have suspected if one had done no more than read the libretto, still less if one had remained outside the theatre, counting only the minutes as they passed. And besides, even from the point of view of mere quantity, in our life the days are not all equal. To reach the end of a day, natures that are slightly nervous, as mine was, make use, like motor-cars, of different 'speeds.' There are mountainous, uncomfortable days, up which one takes an infinite time to pass, and days downward sloping, through which one can go at full tilt, singing as one goes. During this month--in which I went laboriously over, as over a tune, though never to my satisfaction, these visions of Florence, Venice, Pisa, from which the desire that they excited in me drew and kept something as profoundly personal as if it had been love, love for another person--I never ceased to believe that they corresponded to a reality independent of myself, and they made me conscious of as glorious a hope as could have been cherished by a Christian in the primitive age of faith, on the eve of his entry into Paradise. Moreover, without my paying any heed to the contradiction that there was in my wishing to look at and to touch with my organs of sense what had been elaborated by the spell of my dreams and not perceived by my senses at all--though all the more tempting to them, in consequence, more different from anything that they knew--it was that which recalled to me the reality of these visions, which inflamed my desire all the more by seeming to hint a promise that my desire should be satisfied. And for all that the motive force of my exaltation was a longing for aesthetic enjoyments, the guide-books ministered even more to it than books on aesthetics, and, more again than the guide-books, the railway time-tables. What moved me was the thought that this Florence which I could see, so near and yet inaccessible, in my imagination, if the tract which separated it from me, in myself, was not one that I might cross, could yet be reached by a circuit, by a digression, were I to take the plain, terrestrial path. When I repeated to myself, giving thus a special value to what I was going to see, that Venice was the ""School of Giorgione, the home of Titian, the most complete museum of the domestic architecture of the Middle Ages,"" I felt happy indeed. As I was even more when, on one of my walks, as I stepped out briskly on account of the weather, which, after several days of a precocious spring, had relapsed into winter (like the weather that we had invariably found awaiting us at Combray, in Holy Week),--seeing upon the boulevards that the chestnut-trees, though plunged in a glacial atmosphere that soaked through them like a stream of water, were none the less beginning, punctual guests, arrayed already for the party, and admitting no discouragement, to shape and chisel and curve in its frozen lumps the irrepressible verdure whose steady growth the abortive power of the cold might hinder but could not succeed in restraining--I reflected that already the Ponte Vecchio was heaped high with an abundance of hyacinths and anemones, and that the spring sunshine was already tinging the waves of the Grand Canal with so dusky an azure, with emeralds so splendid that when they washed and were broken against the foot of one of Titian's paintings they could vie with it in the richness of their colouring. I could no longer contain my joy when my father, in the intervals of tapping the barometer and complaining of the cold, began to look out which were the best trains, and when I understood that by making one's way, after luncheon, into the coal-grimed laboratory, the wizard's cell that undertook to contrive a complete transmutation of its surroundings, one could awaken, next morning, in the city of marble and gold, in which ""the building of the wall was of jasper and the foundation of the wall an emerald."" So that it and the City of the Lilies were not just artificial scenes which I could set up at my pleasure in front of my imagination, but did actually exist at a certain distance from Paris which must inevitably be traversed if I wished to see them, at their appointed place on the earth's surface, and at no other; in a word they were entirely real. They became even more real to me when my father, by saying: ""Well, you can stay in Venice from the 20th to the 29th, and reach Florence on Easter morning,"" made them both emerge, no longer only from the abstraction of Space, but from that imaginary Time in which we place not one, merely, but several of our travels at once, which do not greatly tax us since they are but possibilities,--that Time which reconstructs itself so effectively that one can spend it again in one town after one has already spent it in another--and consecrated to them some of those actual, calendar days which are certificates of the genuineness of what one does on them, for those unique days are consumed by being used, they do not return, one cannot live them again here when one has lived them elsewhere; I felt that it was towards the week that would begin with the Monday on which the laundress was to bring back the white waistcoat that I had stained with ink, that they were hastening to busy themselves with the duty of emerging from that ideal Time in which they did not, as yet, exist, those two Queen Cities of which I was soon to be able, by the most absorbing kind of geometry, to inscribe the domes and towers on a page of my own life. But I was still on the way, only, to the supreme pinnacle of happiness; I reached it finally (for not until then did the revelation burst upon me that on the clattering streets, reddened by the light reflected from Giorgione's frescoes, it was not, as I had, despite so many promptings, continued to imagine, the men ""majestic and terrible as the sea, bearing armour that gleamed with bronze beneath the folds of their blood-red cloaks,"" who would be walking in Venice next week, on the Easter vigil; but that I myself might be the minute personage whom, in an enlarged photograph of St. Mark's that had been lent to me, the operator had portrayed, in a bowler hat, in front of the portico), when I heard my father say: ""It must be pretty cold, still, on the Grand Canal; whatever you do, don't forget",4.903636923170381,1.5330423406034803,0.4296977635259411,0.03686065070033259,4.439716312056738,4.0,2.453449718734425,85.82608695652173,67.0,60.319909593630385,1.2958459979736576,1.0,0.6696586623077019,1974,770,0.3900709219858156,9076,23,74.10053191663289,1.5186304983901865e+32,6.698855308293721e+28,0.9118293523788452,0.906305174032847,10.092950310559019,33.17315668913264,17.020642500510093,37.08626051715783,42.3941073080481,9.960648429584602,104.31646182987532,15.869565217391305,True,1228.0,0.8742831936479929,4.003528892809881,2267.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010339198258661347,0.0021766733176129148,0.0,0.0066166740185266875,91,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"The chairs, deserted by the imposing but uninspiring company of governesses, stood empty. Only, near the grass, was sitting a lady of uncertain age who came in all weathers, dressed always in an identical style, splendid and sombre, to make whose acquaintance I would have, at that period, sacrificed, had it lain in my power, all the greatest opportunities in my life to come. For Gilberte went up every day to speak to her; she used to ask Gilberte for news of her ""dearest mother"" and it struck me that, if I had known her, I should have been for Gilberte some one wholly different, some one who knew people in her parents' world. While her grandchildren played together at a little distance, she would sit and read the Debats, which she called ""My old _Debats_!"" as, with an aristocratic familiarity, she would say, speaking of the police-sergeant or the woman who let the chairs, ""My old friend the police-sergeant,"" or ""The chair-keeper and I, who are old friends."" Francoise found it too cold to stand about, so we walked to the Pont de la Concorde to see the Seine frozen over, on to which everyone, even children, walked fearlessly, as though upon an enormous whale, stranded, defenceless, and about to be cut up. We returned to the Champs-Elysees; I was growing sick with misery between the motionless wooden horses and the white lawn, caught in a net of black paths from which the snow had been cleared, while the statue that surmounted it held in its hand a long pendent icicle which seemed to explain its gesture. The old lady herself, having folded up her _Debats_, asked a passing nursemaid the time, thanking her with ""How very good of you!"" then begged the road-sweeper to tell her grandchildren to come, as she felt cold, adding ""A thousand thanks. I am sorry to give you so much trouble!"" Suddenly the sky was rent in two: between the punch-and-judy and the horses, against the opening horizon, I had just seen, like a miraculous sign, Mademoiselle's blue feather. And now Gilberte was running at full speed towards me, sparkling and rosy beneath a cap trimmed with fur, enlivened by the cold, by being late, by her anxiety for a game; shortly before she reached me, she slipped on a piece of ice and, either to regain her balance, or because it appeared to her graceful, or else pretending that she was on skates, it was with outstretched arms that she smilingly advanced, as though to embrace me. ""Bravo! bravo! that's splendid; 'topping,' I should say, like you--'sporting,' I suppose I ought to say, only I'm a hundred-and-one, a woman of the old school,"" exclaimed the lady, uttering, on behalf of the voiceless Champs-Elysees, their thanks to Gilberte for having come, without letting herself be frightened away by the weather. ""You are like me, faithful at all costs to our old Champs-Elysees; we are two brave souls! You wouldn't believe me, I dare say, if I told you that I love them, even like this. This snow (I know, you'll laugh at me), it makes me think of ermine!"" And the old lady began to laugh herself. The first of these days--to which the snow, a symbol of the powers that were able to deprive me of the sight of Gilberte, imparted the sadness of a day of separation, almost the aspect of a day of departure, because it changed the outward form and almost forbade the use of the customary scene of our only encounters, now altered, covered, as it were, in dust-sheets--that day, none the less, marked a stage in the progress of my love, for it was, in a sense, the first sorrow that she was to share with me. There were only our two selves of our little company, and to be thus alone with her was not merely like a beginning of intimacy, but also on her part--as though she had come there solely to please me, and in such weather--it seemed to me as touching as if, on one of those days on which she had been invited to a party, she had given it up in order to come to me in the Champs-Elysees; I acquired more confidence in the vitality, in the future of a friendship which could remain so much alive amid the torpor, the solitude, the decay of our surroundings; and while she dropped pellets of snow down my neck, I smiled lovingly at what seemed to me at once a predilection that she shewed for me in thus tolerating me as her travelling companion in this new, this wintry land, and a sort of loyalty to me which she preserved through evil times. Presently, one after another, like shyly hopping sparrows, her friends arrived, black against the snow. We got ready to play and, since this day which had begun so sadly was destined to end in joy, as I went up, before the game started, to the friend with the sharp voice whom I had heard, that first day, calling Gilberte by name, she said to me: ""No, no, I'm sure you'd much rather be in Gilberte's camp; besides, look, she's signalling to you."" She was in fact summoning me to cross the snowy lawn to her camp, to 'take the field,' which the sun, by casting over it a rosy gleam, the metallic lustre of old and worn brocades, had turned into a Field of the Cloth of Gold. This day, which I had begun with so many misgivings, was, as it happened, one of the few on which I was not unduly wretched. For, although I no longer thought, now, of anything save not to let a single day pass without seeing Gilberte (so much so that once, when my grandmother had not come home by dinner-time, I could not resist the instinctive reflection that, if she had been run over in the street and killed, I should not for some time be allowed to play in the Champs-Elysees; when one is in love one has no love left for anyone), yet those moments which I spent in her company, for which I had waited with so much impatience all night and morning, for which I had quivered with excitement, to which I would have sacrificed everything else in the world, were by no means happy moments; well did I know it, for they were the only moments in my life on which I concentrated a scrupulous, undistracted attention, and yet I could not discover in them one atom of pleasure. All the time that I was away from Gilberte, I wanted to see her, because, having incessantly sought to form a mental picture of her, I was unable, in the end, to do so, and did not know exactly to what my love corresponded. Besides, she had never yet told me that she loved me. Far from it, she had often boasted that she knew other little boys whom she preferred to myself, that I was a good companion, with whom she was always willing to play, although I was too absent-minded, not attentive enough to the game. Moreover, she had often shewn signs of apparent coldness towards me, which might have shaken my faith that I was for her a creature different from the rest, had that faith been founded upon a love that Gilberte had felt for me, and not, as was the case, upon the love that I felt for her, which strengthened its resistance to the assaults of doubt by making it depend entirely upon the manner in which I was obliged, by an internal compulsion, to think of Gilberte. But my feelings with regard to her I had never yet ventured to express to her in words. Of course, on every page of my exercise-books, I wrote out, in endless repetition, her name and address, but at the sight of those vague lines which I might trace, without her having to think, on that account, of me, I felt discouraged, because they spoke to me, not of Gilberte, who would never so much as see them, but of my own desire, which they seemed to shew me in its true colours, as something purely personal, unreal, tedious and ineffective. The most important thing was that we should see each other, Gilberte and I, and should have an opportunity of making a mutual confession of our love which, until then, would not officially (so to speak) have begun. Doubtless the various reasons which made me so impatient to see her would have appeared less urgent to a grown man. As life goes on, we acquire such adroitness in the culture of our pleasures, that we content ourselves with that which we derive from thinking of a woman, as I was thinking of Gilberte, without troubling ourselves to ascertain whether the image corresponds to the reality,--and with the pleasure of loving her, without needing to be sure, also, that she loves us; or again that we renounce the pleasure of confessing our passion for her, so as to preserve and enhance the passion that she has for us, like those Japanese gardeners who, to obtain one perfect blossom, will sacrifice the rest. But at the period when I was in love with Gilberte, I still believed that Love did really exist, apart from ourselves; that, allowing us, at the most, to surmount the obstacles in our way, it offered us its blessings in an order in which we were not free to make the least alteration; it seemed to me that if I had, on my own initiative, substituted for the sweetness of a confession a pretence of indifference, I should not only have been depriving myself of one of the joys of which I had most often dreamed, I should have been fabricating, of my own free will, a love that was artificial and without value, that bore no relation to the truth, whose mysterious and foreordained ways I should thus have been declining to follow. But when I arrived at the Champs-Elysees,--and, as at first sight it appeared, was in a position to confront my love, so as to make it undergo the necessary modifications, with its living and independent cause--as soon as I was in the presence of that Gilberte Swann on the sight of whom I had counted to revive the images that my tired memory had lost and could not find again, of that Gilberte Swann with whom I had been playing the day before, and whom I had just been prompted to greet, and then to recognise, by a blind instinct like that which, when we are walking, sets one foot before the other, without giving us time to think what we are doing, then at once it became as though she and the little girl who had inspired my dreams had been two different people. If, for instance, I had retained in my memory overnight two fiery eyes above plump and rosy cheeks, Gilberte's face would now offer me (and with emphasis) something that I distinctly had not remembered, a certain sharpening and prolongation of the nose which, instantaneously associating itself with certain others of her features, assumed the importance of those characteristics which, in natural history, are used to define a species, and transformed her into a little girl of the kind that have sharpened profiles. While I was making myself ready to take advantage of this long expected moment, and to surrender myself to the impression of Gilberte which I had prepared beforehand but could no longer find in my head, to an extent which would enable",3.9429755845177836,1.1958913656302461,0.4231188780513658,0.058993679061983016,4.263051191079574,4.0,2.394502534589375,51.921052631578945,43.0,43.02776434065712,1.2671059300557526,1.0,0.6067015400280326,1973,707,0.35833755701976683,8785,38,78.22112527570789,9.354122983465311e+33,4.0371700403389343e+30,0.7909345671131804,0.7757369904882379,46.937969896230726,19.611060500973668,12.670367459663947,22.91743271000614,24.609497425774272,8.69664470349721,69.66053565235948,9.210526315789474,True,1264.0,0.8562796719896418,3.7915407854984893,2317.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013134606427573359,0.00624126688402422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004191895668374476,0.006520726595249185,0.0055891942244993015,0.002589555459646094,93,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"to pack your winter greatcoat and your thick suit."" At these words I was raised to a sort of ecstasy; a thing that I had until then deemed impossible, I felt myself to be penetrating indeed between those ""rocks of amethyst, like a reef in the Indian Ocean""; by a supreme muscular effort, a long way in excess of my real strength, stripping myself, as of a shell that served no purpose, of the air in my own room which surrounded me, I replaced it by an equal quantity of Venetian air, that marine atmosphere, indescribable and peculiar as the atmosphere of the dreams which my imagination had secreted in the name of Venice; I could feel at work within me a miraculous disincarnation; it was at once accompanied by that vague desire to vomit which one feels when one has a very sore throat; and they had to put me to bed with a fever so persistent that the doctor not only assured my parents that a visit, that spring, to Florence and Venice was absolutely out of the question, but warned them that, even when I should have completely recovered, I must, for at least a year, give up all idea of travelling, and be kept from anything that was liable to excite me. And, alas, he forbade also, most categorically, my being allowed to go to the theatre, to hear Berma; the sublime artist, whose genius Bergotte had proclaimed, might, by introducing me to something else that was, perhaps, as important and as beautiful, have consoled me for not having been to Florence and Venice, for not going to Balbec. My parents had to be content with sending me, every day, to the Champs-Elysees, in the custody of a person who would see that I did not tire myself; this person was none other than Francoise, who had entered our service after the death of my aunt Leonie. Going to the Champs-Elysees I found unendurable. If only Bergotte had described the place in one of his books, I should, no doubt, have longed to see and to know it, like so many things else of which a simulacrum had first found its way into my imagination. That kept things warm, made them live, gave them personality, and I sought then to find their counterpart in reality, but in this public garden there was nothing that attached itself to my dreams. * * * One day, as I was weary of our usual place, beside the wooden horses, Francoise had taken me for an excursion--across the frontier guarded at regular intervals by the little bastions of the barley-sugar women--into those neighbouring but foreign regions, where the faces of the passers-by were strange, where the goat-carriage went past; then she had gone away to lay down her things on a chair that stood with its back to a shrubbery of laurels; while I waited for her I was pacing the broad lawn, of meagre close-cropped grass already faded by the sun, dominated, at its far end, by a statue rising from a fountain, in front of which a little girl with reddish hair was playing with a shuttlecock; when, from the path, another little girl, who was putting on her cloak and covering up her battledore, called out sharply: ""Good-bye, Gilberte, I'm going home now; don't forget, we're coming to you this evening, after dinner."" The name Gilberte passed close by me, evoking all the more forcibly her whom it labelled in that it did not merely refer to her, as one speaks of a man in his absence, but was directly addressed to her; it passed thus close by me, in action, so to speak, with a force that increased with the curve of its trajectory and as it drew near to its target;--carrying in its wake, I could feel, the knowledge, the impression of her to whom it was addressed that belonged not to me but to the friend who called to her, everything that, while she uttered the words, she more or less vividly reviewed, possessed in her memory, of their daily intimacy, of the visits that they paid to each other, of that unknown existence which was all the more inaccessible, all the more painful to me from being, conversely, so familiar, so tractable to this happy girl who let her message brush past me without my being able to penetrate its surface, who flung it on the air with a light-hearted cry: letting float in the atmosphere the delicious attar which that message had distilled, by touching them with precision, from certain invisible points in Mlle. Swann's life, from the evening to come, as it would be, after dinner, at her home,--forming, on its celestial passage through the midst of the children and their nursemaids, a little cloud, exquisitely coloured, like the cloud that, curling over one of Poussin's gardens, reflects minutely, like a cloud in the opera, teeming with chariots and horses, some apparition of the life of the gods; casting, finally, on that ragged grass, at the spot on which she stood (at once a scrap of withered lawn and a moment in the afternoon of the fair player, who continued to beat up and catch her shuttlecock until a governess, with a blue feather in her hat, had called her away) a marvellous little band of light, of the colour of heliotrope, spread over the lawn like a carpet on which I could not tire of treading to and fro with lingering feet, nostalgic and profane, while Francoise shouted: ""Come on, button up your coat, look, and let's get away!"" and I remarked for the first time how common her speech was, and that she had, alas, no blue feather in her hat. Only, would _she_ come again to the Champs-Elysees? Next day she was not there; but I saw her on the following days; I spent all my time revolving round the spot where she was at play with her friends, to such effect that once, when, they found, they were not enough to make up a prisoner's base, she sent one of them to ask me if I cared to complete their side, and from that day I played with her whenever she came. But this did not happen every day; there were days when she had been prevented from coming by her lessons, by her catechism, by a luncheon-party, by the whole of that life, separated from my own, which twice only, condensed into the name of Gilberte, I had felt pass so painfully close to me, in the hawthorn lane near Combray and on the grass of the Champs-Elysees. On such days she would have told us beforehand that we should not see her; if it were because of her lessons, she would say: ""It is too tiresome, I sha'n't be able to come to-morrow; you will all be enjoying yourselves here without me,"" with an air of regret which to some extent consoled me; if, on the other hand, she had been invited to a party, and I, not knowing this, asked her whether she was coming to play with us, she would reply: ""Indeed I hope not! Indeed I hope Mamma will let me go to my friend's."" But on these days I did at least know that I should not see her, whereas on others, without any warning, her mother would take her for a drive, or some such thing, and next day she would say: ""Oh, yes! I went out with Mamma,"" as though it had been the most natural thing in the world, and not the greatest possible misfortune for some one else. There were also the days of bad weather on which her governess, afraid, on her own account, of the rain, would not bring Gilberte to the Champs-Elysees. And so, if the heavens were doubtful, from early morning I would not cease to interrogate them, observing all the omens. If I saw the lady opposite, just inside her window, putting on her hat, I would say to myself: ""That lady is going out; it must, therefore, be weather in which one can go out. Why should not Gilberte do the same as that lady?"" But the day grew dark. My mother said that it might clear again, that one burst of sunshine would be enough, but that more probably it would rain; and if it rained, of what use would it be to go to the Champs-Elysees? And so, from breakfast-time, my anxious eyes never left the uncertain, clouded sky. It remained dark. Outside the window, the balcony was grey. Suddenly, on its sullen stone, I did not indeed see a less negative colour, but I felt as it were an effort towards a less negative colour, the pulsation of a hesitating ray that struggled to discharge its light. A moment later the balcony was as pale and luminous as a standing water at dawn, and a thousand shadows from the iron-work of its balustrade had come to rest on it. A breath of wind dispersed them; the stone grew dark again, but, like tamed creatures, they returned; they began, imperceptibly, to grow lighter, and by one of those continuous crescendos, such as, in music, at the end of an overture, carry a single note to the extreme fortissimo, making it pass rapidly through all the intermediate stages, I saw it attain to that fixed, unalterable gold of fine days, on which the sharply cut shadows of the wrought iron of the balustrade were outlined in black like a capricious vegetation, with a fineness in the delineation of their smallest details which seemed to indicate a deliberate application, an artist's satisfaction, and with so much relief, so velvety a bloom in the restfulness of their sombre and happy mass that in truth those large and leafy shadows which lay reflected on that lake of sunshine seemed aware that they were pledges of happiness and peace of mind. Brief, fading ivy, climbing, fugitive flora, the most colourless, the most depressing, to many minds, of all that creep on walls or decorate windows; to me the dearest of them all, from the day when it appeared upon our balcony, like the very shadow of the presence of Gilberte, who was perhaps already in the Champs-Elysees, and as soon as I arrived there would greet me with: ""Let's begin at once. You are on my side."" Frail, swept away by a breath, but at the same time in harmony, not with the season, with the hour; a promise of that immediate pleasure which the day will deny or fulfil, and thereby of the one paramount immediate pleasure, the pleasure of loving and of being loved; more soft, more warm upon the stone than even moss is; alive, a ray of sunshine sufficing for its birth, and for the birth of joy, even in the heart of winter. And on those days when all other vegetation had disappeared, when the fine jerkins of green leather which covered the trunks of the old trees were hidden beneath the snow; after the snow had ceased to fall, but when the sky was still too much overcast for me to hope that Gilberte would venture out, then suddenly--inspiring my mother to say: ""Look, it's quite fine now; I think you might perhaps try going to the Champs-Elysees after all.""--on the mantle of snow that swathed the balcony, the sun had appeared and was stitching seams of gold, with embroidered patches of dark shadow. That day we found no one there, or else a solitary girl, on the point of departure, who assured me that Gilberte was not coming.",3.60858807954927,1.5306725939444863,0.40980529504254376,0.09173858693807815,4.257491112239715,4.0,2.297176486494636,51.81578947368421,33.5,56.29473905641061,1.261554088369731,1.0,0.6131700197151647,1969,719,0.3651599796851194,8752,38,76.81483052544482,2.2922238425817792e+33,9.897339562097492e+29,0.7599903836443618,0.6980174510843224,47.51449780813131,19.504496137499668,12.349945277499181,22.73748897383123,24.530677875491165,8.66279329608938,68.67714041324744,8.736842105263158,True,1218.0,0.8553540587219344,3.778929188255613,2316.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02728461969725285,0.004111381050270977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010091571668846944,0.008222762100541955,0.013455428891795925,0.005613126079447323,92,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"me, during the long hours which I must spend alone, to be certain that it was indeed herself whom I had in mind, that it was indeed my love for her that I was gradually making grow, as a book grows when one is writing it, she threw me a ball; and, like the idealist philosopher whose body takes account of the external world in the reality of which his intellect declines to believe, the same self which had made me salute her before I had identified her now urged me to catch the ball that she tossed to me (as though she had been a companion, with whom I had come to play, and not a sister-soul with whom my soul had come to be united), made me, out of politeness, until the time came when she had to I go, address a thousand polite and trivial remarks to her, and so prevented me both from keeping a silence in which I might at last have laid my hand upon the indispensable, escaped idea, and from uttering the words which might have made that definite progress in the course of our love on which I was always obliged to count only for the following afternoon. There was, however, an occasional development. One day, we had gone with Gilberte to the stall of our own special vendor, who was always particularly nice to us, since it was to her that M. Swann used to send for his gingerbread, of which, for reasons of health (he suffered from a racial eczema, and from the constipation of the prophets), he consumed a great quantity,--Gilberte pointed out to me with a laugh two little boys who were like the little artist and the little naturalist in the children's storybooks. For one of them would not have a red stick of rock because he preferred the purple, while the other, with tears in his eyes, refused a plum which his nurse was buying for him, because, as he finally explained in passionate tones: ""I want the other plum; it's got a worm in it!"" I purchased two ha'penny marbles. With admiring eyes I saw, luminous and imprisoned in a bowl by themselves, the agate marbles which seemed precious to me because they were as fair and smiling as little girls, and because they cost five-pence each. Gilberte, who was given a great deal more pocket money than I ever had, asked me which I thought the prettiest. They were as transparent, as liquid-seeming as life itself. I would not have had her sacrifice a single one of them. I should have liked her to be able to buy them, to liberate them all. Still, I pointed out one that had the same colour as her eyes. Gilberte took it, turned it about until it shone with a ray of gold, fondled it, paid its ransom, but at once handed me her captive, saying: ""Take it; it is for you, I give it to you, keep it to remind yourself of me."" Another time, being still obsessed by the desire to hear Berma in classic drama, I had asked her whether she had not a copy of a pamphlet in which Bergotte spoke of Racine, and which was now out of print. She had told me to let her know the exact title of it, and that evening I had sent her a little telegram, writing on its envelope the name, Gilberte Swann, which I had so often traced in my exercise-books. Next day she brought me in a parcel tied with pink bows and sealed with white wax, the pamphlet, a copy of which she had managed to find. ""You see, it is what you asked me for,"" she said, taking from her muff the telegram that I had sent her. But in the address on the pneumatic message--which, only yesterday, was nothing, was merely a 'little blue' that I had written, and, after a messenger had delivered it to Gilberte's porter and a servant had taken it to her in her room, had become a thing without value or distinction, one of the 'little blues' that she had received in the course of the day--I had difficulty in recognising the futile, straggling lines of my own handwriting beneath the circles stamped on it at the post-office, the inscriptions added in pencil by a postman, signs of effectual realisation, seals of the external world, violet bands symbolical of life itself, which for the first time came to espouse, to maintain, to raise, to rejoice my dream. And there was another day on which she said to me: ""You know, you may call me 'Gilberte'; in any case, I'm going to call you by your first name. It's too silly not to."" Yet she continued for a while to address me by the more formal '_vous_,' and, when I drew her attention to this, smiled, and composing, constructing a phrase like those that are put into the grammar-books of foreign languages with no other object than to teach us to make use of a new word, ended it with my Christian name. And when I recalled, later, what I had felt at the time, I could distinguish the impression of having been held, for a moment, in her mouth, myself, naked, without, any longer, any of the social qualifications which belonged equally to her other companions and, when she used my surname, to my parents, accessories of which her lips--by the effort that she made, a little after her father's manner, to articulate the words to which she wished to give a special value--had the air of stripping, of divesting me, as one peels the skin from a fruit of which one is going to put only the pulp into one's mouth, while her glance, adapting itself to the same new degree of intimacy as her speech, fell on me also more directly, not without testifying to the consciousness, the pleasure, even the gratitude that it felt, accompanying itself with a smile. But at that actual moment, I was not able to appreciate the worth of these new pleasures. They were given, not by the little girl whom I loved, to me who loved her, but by the other, her with whom I used to play, to my other self, who possessed neither the memory of the true Gilberte, nor the fixed heart which alone could have known the value of a happiness for which it alone had longed. Even after I had returned home I did not taste them, since, every day, the necessity which made me hope that on the morrow I should arrive at the clear, calm, happy contemplation of Gilberte, that she would at last confess her love for me, explaining to me the reasons by which she had been obliged, hitherto, to conceal it, that same necessity forced me to regard the past as of no account, to look ahead of me only, to consider the little advantages that she had given me not in themselves and as if they were self-sufficient, but like fresh rungs of the ladder on which I might set my feet, which were going to allow me to advance a step further and finally to attain the happiness which I had not yet encountered. If, at times, she shewed me these marks of her affection, she troubled me also by seeming not to be pleased to see me, and this happened often on the very days on which I had most counted for the realisation of my hopes. I was sure that Gilberte was coming to the Champs-Elysees, and I felt an elation which seemed merely the anticipation of a great happiness when--going into the drawing-room in the morning to kiss Mamma, who was already dressed to go out, the coils of her black hair elaborately built up, and her beautiful hands, plump and white, fragrant still with soap--I had been apprised, by seeing a column of dust standing by itself in the air above the piano, and by hearing a barrel-organ playing, beneath the window, _En revenant de la revue_, that the winter had received, until nightfall, an unexpected, radiant visit from a day of spring. While we sat at luncheon, by opening her window, the lady opposite had sent packing, in the twinkling of an eye, from beside my chair--to sweep in a single stride over the whole width of our dining-room--a sunbeam which had lain down there for its midday rest and returned to continue it there a moment later. At school, during the one o'clock lesson, the sun made me sick with impatience and boredom as it let fall a golden stream that crept to the edge of my desk, like an invitation to the feast at which I could not myself arrive before three o'clock, until the moment when Francoise came to fetch me at the school-gate, and we made our way towards the Champs-Elysees through streets decorated with sunlight, dense with people, over which the balconies, detached by the sun and made vaporous, seemed to float in front of the houses like clouds of gold. Alas! in the Champs-Elysees I found no Gilberte; she had not yet arrived. Motionless, on the lawn nurtured by the invisible sun which, here and there, kindled to a flame the point of a blade of grass, while the pigeons that had alighted upon it had the appearance of ancient sculptures which the gardener's pick had heaved to the surface of a hallowed soil, I stood with my eyes fixed on the horizon, expecting at every moment to see appear the form of Gilberte following that of her governess, behind the statue that seemed to be holding out the child, which it had in its arms, and which glistened in the stream of light, to receive benediction from the sun. The old lady who read the Debats was sitting on her chair, in her invariable place, and had just accosted a park-keeper, with a friendly wave of her hands towards him as she exclaimed ""What a lovely day!"" And when the chair-woman came up to collect her penny, with an infinity of smirks and affectations she folded the ticket away inside her glove, as though it had been a posy of flowers, for which she had sought, in gratitude to the donor, the most becoming place upon her person. When she had found it, she performed a circular movement with her neck, straightened her boa, and fastened upon the collector, as she shewed her the end of yellow paper that stuck out over her bare wrist, the bewitching smile with which a woman says to a young man, pointing to her bosom: ""You see, I'm wearing your roses!"" I dragged Francoise, on the way towards Gilberte, as far as the Arc de Triomphe; we did not meet her, and I was returning towards the lawn convinced, now, that she was not coming, when, in front of the wooden horses, the little girl with the sharp voice flung herself upon me: ""Quick, quick, Gilberte's been here a quarter of an hour. She's just going. We've been waiting for you, to make up a prisoner's base."" While I had been going up the Avenue des Champs-Elysees, Gilberte had arrived by the Rue Boissy-d'Anglas, Mademoiselle having taken advantage of the fine weather to go on some errand of her own; and M. Swann was coming to fetch his daughter. And so it was my fault; I ought not to have strayed from the lawn; for one never knew for certain from what direction Gilberte would appear, whether she would be early or late, and this perpetual tension succeeded",3.7118337249257016,1.4605567939987454,0.41724712162414035,0.04910383951950775,4.181449569183984,4.0,2.2745023410091325,50.58974358974359,40.0,46.23280994400912,1.264571718195641,1.0,0.5989911958133216,1973,728,0.36898124683223515,8621,39,77.27441002051765,3.629525602479436e+33,1.5808038338325068e+30,0.783929661896668,0.7985230417469064,48.50364289705904,19.061946274708564,12.635684438814376,22.425456483033777,23.559499265728363,8.201824632539278,66.14980441082824,7.871794871794871,True,1250.0,0.8667247386759582,3.7547909407665507,2296.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008986850818276416,0.005297512061299783,0.005108315201967647,0.0021777003484320556,94,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"in making more impressive not only the Champs-Elysees in their entirety, and the whole span of the afternoon, like a vast expanse of space and time, on every point and at every moment of which it was possible that the form of Gilberte might appear, but also that form itself, since behind its appearance I felt that there lay concealed the reason for which it had shot its arrow into my heart at four o'clock instead of at half-past two; crowned with a smart hat, for paying calls, instead of the plain cap, for games; in front of the Ambassadeurs and not between the two puppet-shows; I divined one of those occupations in which I might not follow Gilberte, occupations that forced her to go out or to stay at home, I was in contact with the mystery of her unknown life. It was this mystery, too, which troubled me when, running at the sharp-voiced girl's bidding, so as to begin our game without more delay, I saw Gilberte, so quick and informal with us, make a ceremonious bow to the old lady with the _Debats_ (who acknowledged it with ""What a lovely sun! You'd think there was a fire burning."") speaking to her with a shy smile, with an air of constraint which called to my mind the other little girl that Gilberte must be when at home with her parents, or with friends of her parents, paying visits, in all the rest, that escaped me, of her existence. But of that existence no one gave me so strong an impression as did M. Swann, who came a little later to fetch his daughter. That was because he and Mme. Swann--inasmuch as their daughter lived with them, as her lessons, her games, her friendships depended upon them--contained for me, like Gilberte, perhaps even more than Gilberte, as befitted subjects that had an all-powerful control over her in whom it must have had its source, an undefined, an inaccessible quality of melancholy charm. Everything that concerned them was on my part the object of so constant a preoccupation that the days on which, as on this day, M. Swann (whom I had seen so often, long ago, without his having aroused my curiosity, when he was still on good terms with my parents) came for Gilberte to the Champs-Elysees, once the pulsations to which my heart had been excited by the appearance of his grey hat and hooded cape had subsided, the sight of him still impressed me as might that of an historic personage, upon whom one had just been studying a series of books, and the smallest details of whose life one learned with enthusiasm. His relations with the Comte de Paris, which, when I heard them discussed at Combray, seemed to me unimportant, became now in my eyes something marvellous, as if no one else had ever known the House of Orleans; they set him in vivid detachment against the vulgar background of pedestrians of different classes, who encumbered that particular path in the Champs-Elysees, in the midst of whom I admired his condescending to figure without claiming any special deference, which as it happened none of them dreamed of paying him, so profound was the incognito in which he was wrapped. He responded politely to the salutations of Gilberte's companions, even to mine, for all that he was no longer on good terms with my family, but without appearing to know who I was. (This reminded me that he had constantly seen me in the country; a memory which I had retained, but kept out of sight, because, since I had seen Gilberte again, Swann had become to me pre-eminently her father, and no longer the Combray Swann; as the ideas which, nowadays, I made his name connote were different from the ideas in the system of which it was formerly comprised, which I utilised not at all now when I had occasion to think of him, he had become a new, another person; still I attached him by an artificial thread, secondary and transversal, to our former guest; and as nothing had any longer any value for me save in the extent to which my love might profit by it, it was with a spasm of shame and of regret at not being able to erase them from my memory that I recaptured the years in which, in the eyes of this same Swann who was at this moment before me in the Champs-Elysees, and to whom, fortunately, Gilberte had perhaps not mentioned my name, I had so often, in the evenings, made myself ridiculous by sending to ask Mamma to come upstairs to my room to say good-night to me, while she was drinking coffee with him and my father and my grandparents at the table in the garden.) He told Gilberte that she might play one game; he could wait for a quarter of an hour; and, sitting down, just like anyone else, on an iron chair, paid for his ticket with that hand which Philippe VII had so often held in his own, while we began our game upon the lawn, scattering the pigeons, whose beautiful, iridescent bodies (shaped like hearts and, surely, the lilacs of the feathered kingdom) took refuge as in so many sanctuaries, one on the great basin of stone, on which its beak, as it disappeared below the rim, conferred the part, assigned the purpose of offering to the bird in abundance the fruit or grain at which it appeared to be pecking, another on the head of the statue, which it seemed to crown with one of those enamelled objects whose polychrome varies in certain classical works the monotony of the stone, and with an attribute which, when the goddess bears it, entitles her to a particular epithet and makes of her, as a different Christian name makes of a mortal, a fresh divinity. On one of these sunny days which had not realised my hopes, I had not the courage to conceal my disappointment from Gilberte. ""I had ever so many things to ask you,"" I said to her; ""I thought that to-day was going to mean so much in our friendship. And no sooner have you come than you go away! Try to come early to-morrow, so that I can talk to you."" Her face lighted up and she jumped for joy as she answered: ""Tomorrow, you may make up your mind, my dear friend, I sha'n't come! ""First of all I've a big luncheon-party; then in the afternoon I am going to a friend's house to see King Theodosius arrive from her windows; won't that be splendid?--and then, next day, I'm going to _Michel Strogoff_, and after that it will soon be Christmas, and the New Year holidays! Perhaps they'll take me south, to the Riviera; won't that be nice? Though I should miss the Christmas-tree here; anyhow, if I do stay in Paris, I sha'n't be coming here, because I shall be out paying calls with Mamma. Good-bye--there's Papa calling me."" I returned home with Francoise through streets that were still gay with sunshine, as on the evening of a holiday when the merriment is over. I could scarcely drag my legs along. ""I'm not surprised;"" said Francoise, ""it's not the right weather for the time of year; it's much too warm. Oh dear, oh dear, to think of all the poor sick people there must be everywhere; you would think that up there, too, everything's got out of order."" I repeated to myself, stifling my sobs, the words in which Gilberte had given utterance to her joy at the prospect of not coming back, for a long time, to the Champs-Elysees. But already the charm with which, by the mere act of thinking, my mind was filled as soon as it thought of her, the privileged position, unique even if it were painful, in which I was inevitably placed in relation to Gilberte by the contraction of a scar in my mind, had begun to add to that very mark of her indifference something romantic, and in the midst of my tears my lips would shape themselves in a smile which was indeed the timid outline of a kiss. And when the time came for the postman I said to myself, that evening as on every other: ""I am going to have a letter from Gilberte, she is going to tell me, at last, that she has never ceased to love me, and to explain to me the mysterious reason by which she has been forced to conceal her love from me until now, to put on the appearance of being able to be happy without seeing me; the reason for which she has assumed the form of the other Gilberte, who is simply a companion."" Every evening I would beguile myself into imagining this letter, believing that I was actually reading it, reciting each of its sentences in turn. Suddenly I would stop, in alarm. I had realised that, if I was to receive a letter from Gilberte, it could not, in any case, be this letter, since it was I myself who had just composed it. And from that moment I would strive to keep my thoughts clear of the words which I should have liked her to write to me, from fear lest, by first selecting them myself, I should be excluding just those identical words,--the dearest, the most desired--from the field of possible events. Even if, by an almost impossible coincidence, it had been precisely the letter of my invention that Gilberte had addressed to me of her own accord, recognising my own work in it I should not have had the impression that I was receiving something that had not originated in myself, something real, something new, a happiness external to my mind, independent of my will, a gift indeed from love. While I waited I read over again a page which, although it had not been written to me by Gilberte, came to me, none the less, from her, that page by Bergotte upon the beauty of the old myths from which Racine drew his inspiration, which (with the agate marble) I always kept within reach. I was touched by my friend's kindness in having procured the book for me; and as everyone is obliged to find some reason for his passion, so much so that he is glad to find in the creature whom he loves qualities which (he has learned by reading or in conversation) are worthy to excite a man's love, that he assimilates them by imitation and makes out of them fresh reasons for his love, even although these qualities be diametrically opposed to those for which his love would have sought, so long as it was spontaneous--as Swann, before my day, had sought to establish the aesthetic basis of Odette's beauty--I, who had at first loved Gilberte, in Combray days, on account of all the unknown element in her life into which I would fain have plunged headlong, have undergone reincarnation, discarding my own separate existence as a thing that no longer mattered, I thought now, as of an inestimable advantage, that of this, my own, my too familiar, my contemptible existence Gilberte might one day become the humble servant, the kindly, the comforting collaborator, who in the evenings, helping me in my work, would collate for me the texts of rare pamphlets. As for Bergotte, that infinitely wise, almost divine old man, because of whom I had first, before I had even seen her, loved Gilberte, now it was for Gilberte's sake, chiefly, that I loved him.

"to burst open in the midst of her narrative (an arid desert to me) a mystic blossom. What a melancholy satisfaction to learn that, that very afternoon, threading through the crowd his supernatural form, Swann had gone to buy an umbrella. Among the events of the day, great and small, but all equally unimportant, that one alone aroused in me those peculiar vibrations by which my love for Gilberte was invariably stirred. My father complained that I took no interest in anything, because I did not listen while he was speaking of the political developments that might follow the visit of King Theodosius, at that moment in France as the nation's guest and (it was hinted) ally. And yet how intensely interested I was to know whether Swann had been wearing his hooded cape! ""Did you speak to him?"" I asked. ""Why, of course I did,"" answered my mother, who always seemed afraid lest, were she to admit that we were not on the warmest of terms with Swann, people would seek to reconcile us more than she cared for, in view of the existence of Mme. Swann, whom she did not wish to know. ""It was he who came up and spoke to me. I hadn't seen him."" ""Then you haven't quarrelled?"" ""Quarrelled? What on earth made you think that we had quarrelled?"" she briskly parried, as though I had cast doubt on the fiction of her friendly relations with Swann, and was planning an attempt to 'bring them together. ""He might be cross with you for never asking him here."" ""One isn't obliged to ask everyone to one's house, you know; has he ever asked me to his? I don't know his wife."" ""But he used often to come, at Combray."" ""I should think he did! He used to come at Combray, and now, in Paris, he has something better to do, and so have I. But I can promise you, we didn't look in the least like people who had quarrelled. We were kept waiting there for some time, while they brought him his parcel. He asked after you; he told me you had been playing with his daughter--"" my mother went on, amazing me with the portentous revelation of my own existence in Swann's mind; far more than that, of my existence in so complete, so material a form that when I stood before him, trembling with love, in the Champs-Elysees, he had known my name, and who my mother was, and had been able to blend with my quality as his daughter's playmate certain facts with regard to my grandparents and their connections, the place in which we lived, certain details of our past life, all of which I myself perhaps did not know. But my mother did not seem to have noticed anything particularly attractive in that counter at the Trois Quartiers where she had represented to Swann, at the moment in which he caught sight of her, a definite person with whom he had sufficient memories in common to impel him to come up to her and to speak. Nor did either she or my father seem to find any occasion now to mention Swann's family, the grandparents of Gilberte, nor to use the title of stockbroker, topics as which nothing else gave me so keen a pleasure. My imagination had isolated and consecrated in the social Paris a certain family, just as it had set apart in the structural Paris a certain house, on whose porch it had fashioned sculptures and made its windows precious. But these ornaments I alone had eyes to see. Just as my father and mother looked upon the house in which Swann lived as one that closely resembled the other houses built at the same period in the neighbourhood of the Bois, so Swann's family seemed to them to be in the same category as many other families of stockbrokers. Their judgment was more or less favourable according to the extent to which the family in question shared in merits that were common to the rest of the universe, and there was about it nothing that they could call unique. What, on the other hand, they did appreciate in the Swanns they found in equal, if not in greater measure elsewhere. And so, after admitting that the house was in a good position, they would go on to speak of some other house that was in a better, but had nothing to do with Gilberte, or of financiers on a larger scale than her grandfather had been; and if they had appeared, for a moment, to be of my opinion, that was a mistake which was very soon corrected. For in order to distinguish in all Gilberte's surroundings an indefinable quality analogous, in the scale of emotions, to what in the scale of colours is called infra-red, a supplementary sense of perception was required, with which love, for the time being, had endowed me; and this my parents lacked. On the days when Gilberte had warned me that she would not be coming to the Champs-Elysees, I would try to arrange my walks so that I should be brought into some kind of contact with her. Sometimes I would lead Francoise on a pilgrimage to the house in which the Swanns lived, making her repeat to me unendingly all that she had learned from the governess with regard to Mme. Swann. ""It seems, she puts great faith in medals. She would never think of starting on a journey if she had heard an owl hoot, or the death-watch in the wall, or if she had seen a cat at midnight, or if the furniture had creaked. Oh yes! she's a most religious lady, she is!"" I was so madly in love with Gilberte that if, on our way, I caught sight of their old butler taking the dog out, my emotion would bring me to a standstill, I would fasten on his white whiskers eyes that melted with passion. And Francoise would rouse me with: ""What's wrong with you now, child?"" and we would continue on our way until we reached their gate, where a porter, different from every other porter in the world, and saturated, even to the braid on his livery, with the same melancholy charm that I had felt to be latent in the name of Gilberte, looked at me as though he knew that I was one of those whose natural unworthiness would for ever prevent them from penetrating into the mysteries of the life inside, which it was his duty to guard, and over which the ground-floor windows appeared conscious of being protectingly closed, with far less resemblance, between the nobly sweeping arches of their muslin curtains, to any other windows in the world than to Gilberte's glancing eyes. On other days we would go along the boulevards, and I would post myself at the corner of the Rue Duphot; I had heard that Swann was often to be seen passing there, on his way to the dentist's; and my imagination so far differentiated Gilberte's father from the rest of humanity, his presence in the midst of a crowd of real people introduced among them so miraculous an element, that even before we reached the Madeleine I would be trembling with emotion at the thought that I was approaching a street from which that supernatural apparition might at any moment burst upon me unawares. But most often of all, on days when I was not to see Gilberte, as I had heard that Mme. Swann walked almost every day along the Allee des Acacias, round the big lake, and in the Allee de la Reine Marguerite, I would guide Francoise in the direction of the Bois de Boulogne. It was to me like one of those zoological gardens in which one sees assembled together a variety of flora, and contrasted effects in landscape; where from a hill one passes to a grotto, a meadow, rocks, a stream, a trench, another hill, a marsh, but knows that they are there only to enable the hippopotamus, zebra, crocodile, rabbit, bear and heron to disport themselves in a natural or a picturesque setting; this, the Bois, equally complex, uniting a multitude of little worlds, distinct and separate--placing a stage set with red trees, American oaks, like an experimental forest in Virginia, next to a fir-wood by the edge of the lake, or to a forest grove from which would suddenly emerge, in her lissom covering of furs, with the large, appealing eyes of a dumb animal, a hastening walker--was the Garden of Woman; and like the myrtle-alley in the Aeneid, planted for their delight with trees of one kind only, the Allee des Acacias was thronged by the famous Beauties of the day. As, from a long way off, the sight of the jutting crag from which it dives into the pool thrills with joy the children who know that they are going to behold the seal, long before I reached the acacia-alley, their fragrance, scattered abroad, would make me feel that I was approaching the incomparable presence of a vegetable personality, strong and tender; then, as I drew near, the sight of their topmost branches, their lightly tossing foliage, in its easy grace, its coquettish outline, its delicate fabric, over which hundreds of flowers were laid, like winged and throbbing colonies of precious insects; and finally their name itself, feminine, indolent and seductive, made my heart beat, but with a social longing, like those waltzes which remind us only of the names of the fair dancers, called aloud as they entered the ball-room. I had been told that I should see in the alley certain women of fashion, who, in spite of their not all having husbands, were constantly mentioned in conjunction with Mme. Swann, but most often by their professional names;--their new names, when they had any, being but a sort of incognito, a veil which those who would speak of them were careful to draw aside, so as to make themselves understood. Thinking that Beauty--in the order of feminine elegance--was governed by occult laws into the knowledge of which they had been initiated, and that they had the power to realise it, I accepted before seeing them, like the truth of a coming revelation, the appearance of their clothes, of their carriages and horses, of a thousand details among which I placed my faith as in an inner soul which gave the cohesion of a work of art to that ephemeral and changing pageant. But it was Mme. Swann whom I wished to see, and I waited for her to go past, as deeply moved as though she were Gilberte, whose parents, saturated, like everything in her environment, with her own special charm, excited in me as keen a passion as she did herself, indeed a still more painful disturbance (since their point of contact with her was that intimate, that internal part of her life which was hidden from me), and furthermore, for I very soon learned, as we shall see in due course, that they did not like my playing with her, that feeling of veneration which we always have for those who hold, and exercise without restraint, the power to do us an injury. I assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of social grandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a 'polonaise' of plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a pheasant's wing, a bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the Allee des Acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her",3.5011480500622816,1.56790326151712,0.41846346688097835,0.0852909425256558,4.315173116089613,4.0,2.380537583386737,40.08163265306123,27.0,40.42571253631948,1.295315682281059,1.0,0.64327830504205,1964,717,0.365071283095723,8807,49,74.28616733761734,1.8284056576861658e+32,8.058200342380633e+28,0.7604622777240971,0.7534897317911716,56.56843613616526,15.326561785610377,12.106272717509672,18.497011513362985,18.93528170331269,8.834725050916497,57.49507460825471,6.979591836734694,True,1216.0,0.873512560599383,3.881445570736007,2269.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008552570419261876,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01171330296551083,0.005577763316909919,0.005856651482755415,0.004407227853680035,97,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"as the pages that he had written about Racine, I studied the wrapper, folded under great seals of white wax and tied with billows of pink ribbon, in which she had brought those pages to me. I kissed the agate marble, which was the better part of my love's heart, the part that was not frivolous but faithful, and, for all that it was adorned with the mysterious charm of Gilberte's life, dwelt close beside me, inhabited my chamber, shared my bed. But the beauty of that stone, and the beauty also of those pages of Bergotte which I was glad to associate with the idea of my love for Gilberte, as if, in the moments when my love seemed no longer to have any existence, they gave it a kind of consistency, were, I perceived, anterior to that love, which they in no way resembled; their elements had been determined by the writer's talent, or by geological laws, before ever Gilberte had known me, nothing in book or stone would have been different if Gilberte had not loved me, and there was nothing, consequently, that authorised me to read in them a message of happiness. And while my love, incessantly waiting for the morrow to bring a confession of Gilberte's love for me, destroyed, unravelled every evening, the ill-done work of the day, in some shadowed part of my being was an unknown weaver who would not leave where they lay the severed threads, but collected and rearranged them, without any thought of pleasing me, or of toiling for my advantage, in the different order which she gave to all her handiwork. Without any special interest in my love, not beginning by deciding that I was loved, she placed, side by side, those of Gilberte's actions that had seemed to me inexplicable and her faults which I had excused. Then, one with another, they took on a meaning. It seemed to tell me, this new arrangement, that when I saw Gilberte, instead of coming to me in the Champs-Elysees, going to a party, or on errands with her governess, when I saw her prepared for an absence that would extend over the New Year holidays, I was wrong in thinking, in saying: ""It is because she is frivolous,"" or ""easily lead."" For she would have ceased to be either if she had loved me, and if she had been forced to obey it would have been with the same despair in her heart that I felt on the days when I did not see her. It shewed me further, this new arrangement, that I ought, after all, to know what it was to love, since I loved Gilberte; it drew my attention to the constant anxiety that I had to 'shew off' before her, by reason of which I tried to persuade my mother to get for Francoise a waterproof coat and a hat with a blue feather, or, better still, to stop sending with me to the Champs-Elysees an attendant with whom I blushed to be seen (to all of which my mother replied that I was not fair to Francoise, that she was an excellent woman and devoted to us all) and also that sole, exclusive need to see Gilberte, the result of which was that, months in advance, I could think of nothing but how to find out at what date she would be leaving Paris and where she was going, feeling that the most attractive country in the world would be but a place of exile if she were not to be there, and asking only to be allowed to stay for ever in Paris, so long as I might see her in the Champs-Elysees; and it had little difficulty in making me see that neither my anxiety nor my need could be justified by anything in Gilberte's conduct. She, on the contrary, was genuinely fond of her governess, without troubling herself over what I might choose to think about it. It seemed quite natural to her not to come to the Champs-Elysees if she had to go shopping with Mademoiselle, delightful if she had to go out somewhere with her mother. And even supposing that she would ever have allowed me to spend my holidays in the same place as herself, when it came to choosing that place she considered her parents' wishes, a thousand different amusements of which she had been told, and not at all that it should be the place to which my family were proposing to send me. When she assured me (as sometimes happened) that she liked me less than some other of her friends, less than she had liked me the day before, because by my clumsiness I had made her side lose a game, I would beg her pardon, I would beg her to tell me what I must do in order that she should begin again to like me as much as, or more than the rest; I hoped to hear her say that that was already my position; I besought her; as though she had been able to modify her affection for me as she or I chose, to give me pleasure, merely by the words that she would utter, as my good or bad conduct should deserve. Was I, then, not yet aware that what I felt, myself, for her, depended neither upon her actions nor upon my desires? It shewed me finally, the new arrangement planned by my unseen weaver, that, if we find ourselves hoping that the actions of a person who has hitherto caused us anxiety may prove not to have been sincere, they shed in their wake a light which our hopes are powerless to extinguish, a light to which, rather than to our hopes, we must put the question, what will be that person's actions on the morrow. These new counsels, my love listened and heard them; they persuaded it that the morrow would not be different from all the days that had gone before; that Gilberte's feeling for me, too long established now to be capable of alteration, was indifference; that in my friendship with Gilberte, it was I alone who loved. ""That is true,"" my love responded, ""there is nothing more to be made of that friendship. It will not alter now."" And so the very next day (unless I were to wait for a public holiday, if there was one approaching, some anniversary, the New Year, perhaps, one of those days which are not like other days, on which time starts afresh, casting aside the heritage of the past, declining its legacy of sorrows) I would appeal to Gilberte to terminate our old and to join me in laying the foundations of a new friendship. * * * I had always, within reach, a plan of Paris, which, because I could see drawn on it the street in which M. and Mme. Swann lived, seemed to me to contain a secret treasure. And to please myself, as well as by a sort of chivalrous loyalty, in any connection or with no relevance at all, I would repeat the name of that street until my father, not being, like my mother and grandmother, in the secret of my love, would ask: ""But why are you always talking about that street? There's nothing wonderful about it. It is an admirable street to live in because it's only a few minutes' walk from the Bois, but there are a dozen other streets just the same."" I made every effort to introduce the name of Swann into my conversation with my parents; in my own mind, of course, I never ceased to murmur it; but I needed also to hear its exquisite sound, and to make myself play that chord, the voiceless rendering of which did not suffice me. Moreover, that name of Swann, with which I had for so long been familiar, was to me now (as happens at times to people suffering from aphasia, in the case of the most ordinary words) the name of something new. It was for ever present in my mind, which could not, however, grow accustomed to it. I analysed it, I spelt it; its orthography came to me as a surprise. And with its familiarity it had simultaneously lost its innocence. The pleasure that I derived from the sound of it I felt to be so guilty, that it seemed to me as though the others must read my thoughts, and would change the conversation if I endeavoured to guide it in that direction. I fell back upon subjects which still brought me into touch with Gilberte, I eternally repeated the same words, and it was no use my knowing that they were but words--words uttered in her absence, which she could not hear, words without virtue in themselves, repeating what were, indeed, facts, but powerless to modify them--for still it seemed to me that by dint of handling, of stirring in this way everything that had reference to Gilberte, I might perhaps make emerge from it something that would bring me happiness. I told my parents again that Gilberte was very fond of her governess, as if the statement, when repeated for the hundredth time, would at last have the effect of making Gilberte suddenly burst into the room, come to live with us for ever. I had already sung the praises of the old lady who read the _Debats_ (I had hinted to my parents that she must at least be an Ambassador's widow, if not actually a Highness) and I continued to descant on her beauty, her splendour, her nobility, until the day on which I mentioned that, by what I had heard Gilberte call her, she appeared to be a Mme. Blatin. ""Oh, now I know whom you mean,"" cried my mother, while I felt myself grow red all over with shame. ""On guard! on guard!--as your grandfather says. And so it's she that you think so wonderful? Why, she's perfectly horrible, and always has been. She's the widow of a bailiff. You can't remember, when you were little, all the trouble I used to have to avoid her at your gymnastic lessons, where she was always trying to get hold of me--I didn't know the woman, of course--to tell me that you were 'much too nice-looking for a boy.' She has always had an insane desire to get to know people, and she must be quite insane, as I have always thought, if she really does know Mme. Swann. For even if she does come of very common people, I have never heard anything said against her character. But she must always be forcing herself upon strangers. She is, really, a horrible woman, frightfully vulgar, and besides, she is always creating awkward situations."" As for Swann, in my attempts to resemble him, I spent the whole time, when I was at table, in drawing my finger along my nose and in rubbing my eyes. My father would exclaim: ""The child's a perfect idiot, he's becoming quite impossible."" More than all else I should have liked to be as bald as Swann. He appeared to me to be a creature so extraordinary that I found it impossible to believe that people whom I knew and often saw knew him also, and that in the course of the day anyone might run against him. And once my mother, while she was telling us, as she did every evening at dinner, where she had been and what she had done that afternoon, merely by the words: ""By the way, guess whom I saw at the Trois Quartiers--at the umbrella counter--Swann!"" caused",3.397067507664225,1.3937259984736767,0.41716036485915,0.09584255060840623,4.155102040816327,4.0,2.2710297245953948,38.431372549019606,30.0,38.02643812080385,1.2505102040816327,1.0,0.5569594431594173,1960,629,0.3209183673469388,8490,51,75.47126697455096,5.980738161613145e+32,2.6231307726373443e+29,0.7567230811342597,0.7404893119724429,62.03399359743899,14.154255702280913,10.884849518146861,17.290916366546618,17.3562168867547,7.861795918367346,54.75790316126451,6.2745098039215685,True,1327.0,0.8675438596491228,3.723684210526316,2280.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02806513409961686,0.0053639846743295016,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003735632183908046,0.0030651340996168583,0.006896551724137931,0.0017543859649122807,96,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"own house, and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the gentlemen in carriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were raising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never anyone so well turned out as she. But instead of simplicity it was to ostentation that I must assign the first place if, after I had compelled Francoise, who could hold out no longer, and complained that her legs were 'giving' beneath her, to stroll up and down with me for another hour, I saw at length, emerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for me a royal dignity, the passage of a sovereign, an impression such as no real Queen has ever since been able to give me, because my notion of their power has been less vague, and more founded upon experience--borne along by the flight of a pair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as one sees them in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an enormous coachman, furred like a cossack, and by his side a diminutive groom, like Toby, ""the late Beaudenord's tiger,"" I saw--or rather I felt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab--a matchless victoria, built rather high, and hinting, through the extreme modernity of its appointments, at the forms of an earlier day, deep down in which lay negligently back Mme. Swann, her hair, now quite pale with one grey lock, girt with a narrow band of flowers, usually violets, from which floated down long veils, a lilac parasol in her hand, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I read only the benign condescension of Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the enticing smile of the courtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her. That smile was, in reality, saying to one: ""Oh yes, I do remember, quite well; it was wonderful!"" to another: ""How I should have loved to! We were unfortunate!"", to a third: ""Yes, if you like! I must just keep in the line for a minute, then as soon as I can I will break away."" When strangers passed she still allowed to linger about her lips a lazy smile, as though she expected or remembered some friend, which made them say: ""What a lovely woman!"". And for certain men only she had a sour, strained, shy, cold smile which meant: ""Yes, you old goat, I know that you've got a tongue like a viper, that you can't keep quiet for a moment. But do you suppose that I care what you say?"" Coquelin passed, talking, in a group of listening friends, and with a sweeping wave of his hand bade a theatrical good day to the people in the carriages. But I thought only of Mme. Swann, and pretended to have not yet seen her, for I knew that, when she reached the pigeon-shooting ground, she would tell her coachman to 'break away' and to stop the carriage, so that she might come back on foot. And on days when I felt that I had the courage to pass close by her I would drag Francoise off in that direction; until the moment came when I saw Mme. Swann, letting trail behind her the long train of her lilac skirt, dressed, as the populace imagine queens to be dressed, in rich attire such as no other woman might wear, lowering her eyes now and then to study the handle of her parasol, paying scant attention to the passers-by, as though the important thing for her, her one object in being there, was to take exercise, without thinking that she was seen, and that every head was turned towards her. Sometimes, however, when she had looked back to call her dog to her, she would cast, almost imperceptibly, a sweeping glance round about. Those even who did not know her were warned by something exceptional, something beyond the normal in her--or perhaps by a telepathic suggestion such as would move an ignorant audience to a frenzy of applause when Berma was 'sublime'--that she must be some one well-known. They would ask one another, ""Who is she?"", or sometimes would interrogate a passing stranger, or would make a mental note of how she was dressed so as to fix her identity, later, in the mind of a friend better informed than themselves, who would at once enlighten them. Another pair, half-stopping in their walk, would exchange: ""You know who that is? Mme. Swann! That conveys nothing to you? Odette de Crecy, then?"" ""Odette de Crecy! Why, I thought as much. Those great, sad eyes... But I say, you know, she can't be as young as she was once, eh? I remember, I had her on the day that MacMahon went."" ""I shouldn't remind her of it, if I were you. She is now Mme. Swann, the wife of a gentleman in the Jockey Club, a friend of the Prince of Wales. Apart from that, though, she is wonderful still."" ""Oh, but you ought to have known her then; Gad, she was lovely! She lived in a very odd little house with a lot of Chinese stuff. I remember, we were bothered all the time by the newsboys, shouting outside; in the end she made me get up and go."" Without listening to these memories, I could feel all about her the indistinct murmur of fame. My heart leaped with impatience when I thought that a few seconds must still elapse before all these people, among whom I was dismayed not to find a certain mulatto banker who (or so I felt) had a contempt for me, were to see the unknown youth, to whom they had not, so far, been paying the slightest attention, salute (without knowing her, it was true, but I thought that I had sufficient authority since my parents knew her husband and I was her daughter's playmate) this woman whose reputation for beauty, for misconduct, and for elegance was universal. But I was now close to Mme. Swann; I pulled off my hat with so lavish, so prolonged a gesture that she could not repress a smile. People laughed. As for her, she had never seen me with Gilberte, she did not know my name, but I was for her--like one of the keepers in the Bois, like the boatman, or the ducks on the lake, to which she threw scraps of bread--one of the minor personages, familiar, nameless, as devoid of individual character as a stage-hand in a theatre, of her daily walks abroad. On certain days when I had missed her in the Allee des Acacias I would be so fortunate as to meet her in the Allee de la Reine Marguerite, where women went who wished to be alone, or to appear to be wishing to be alone; she would not be alone for long, being soon overtaken by some man or other, often in a grey 'tile' hat, whom I did not know, and who would talk to her for some time, while their two carriages crawled behind. * * * That sense of the complexity of the Bois de Boulogne which made it an artificial place and, in the zoological or mythological sense of the word, a Garden, I captured again, this year, as I crossed it on my way to Trianon, on one of those mornings, early in November, when in Paris, if we stay indoors, being so near and yet prevented from witnessing the transformation scene of autumn, which is drawing so rapidly to a close without our assistance, we feel a regret for the fallen leaves that becomes a fever, and may even keep us awake at night. Into my closed room they had been drifting already for a month, summoned there by my desire to see them, slipping between my thoughts and the object, whatever it might be, upon which I was trying to concentrate them, whirling in front of me like those brown spots that sometimes, whatever we may be looking at, will seem to be dancing or swimming before our eyes. And on that morning, not hearing the splash of the rain as on the previous days, seeing the smile of fine weather at the corners of my drawn curtains, as from the corners of closed lips may escape the secret of their happiness, I had felt that I could actually see those yellow leaves, with the light shining through them, in their supreme beauty; and being no more able to restrain myself from going to look at the trees than, in my childhood's days, when the wind howled in the chimney, I had been able to resist the longing to visit the sea, I had risen and left the house to go to Trianon, passing through the Bois de Boulogne. It was the hour and the season in which the Bois seems, perhaps, most multiform, not only because it is then most divided, but because it is divided in a different way. Even in the unwooded parts, where the horizon is large, here and there against the background of a dark and distant mass of trees, now leafless or still keeping their summer foliage unchanged, a double row of orange-red chestnuts seemed, as in a picture just begun, to be the only thing painted, so far, by an artist who had not yet laid any colour on the rest, and to be offering their cloister, in full daylight, for the casual exercise of the human figures that would be added to the picture later on. Farther off, at a place where the trees were still all green, one alone, small, stunted, lopped, but stubborn in its resistance, was tossing in the breeze an ugly mane of red. Elsewhere, again, might be seen the first awakening of this Maytime of the leaves, and those of an ampelopsis, a smiling miracle, like a red hawthorn flowering in winter, had that very morning all 'come out,' so to speak, in blossom. And the Bois had the temporary, unfinished, artificial look of a nursery garden or a park in which, either for some botanic purpose or in preparation for a festival, there have been embedded among the trees of commoner growth, which have not yet been uprooted and transplanted elsewhere, a few rare specimens, with fantastic foliage, which seem to be clearing all round themselves an empty space, making room, giving air, diffusing light. Thus it was the time of year at which the Bois de Boulogne displays more separate characteristics, assembles more distinct elements in a composite whole than at any other. It was also the time of day. In places where the trees still kept their leaves, they seemed to have undergone an alteration of their substance from the point at which they were touched by the sun's light, still, at this hour in the morning, almost horizontal, as it would be again, a few hours later, at the moment when, just as dusk began, it would flame up like a lamp, project afar over the leaves a warm and artificial glow, and set ablaze the few topmost boughs of a tree that would itself remain unchanged, a sombre incombustible candelabrum beneath its flaming crest. At one spot the light grew solid as a brick wall, and like a piece of yellow Persian masonry, patterned in blue, daubed coarsely upon the sky the leaves of the chestnuts; at another, it cut them off from the sky towards which they stretched out their curling, golden fingers. Half-way up the trunk of a tree draped with wild vine, the light had grafted and brought to blossom, too dazzling to",3.2757378427612425,1.4308035146311815,0.3948351369170415,0.1181671934488334,4.2289648138704745,4.0,2.2714998963187547,38.450980392156865,23.0,45.209019456468,1.2514023457419683,1.0,0.5919133116086901,1961,753,0.3839877613462519,8679,51,77.37620320357252,4.018445493830967e+33,1.7365797293997263e+30,0.733421309441328,0.6517535097783014,61.938616452190274,14.172430032696408,11.326091736570909,17.522156562778097,17.713914469408373,8.296501784803674,55.687084420713724,6.627450980392157,True,1205.0,0.8513396715643907,3.7506482281763183,2314.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007056167090036692,0.005644933672029354,0.004139618026154859,0.00216076058772688,98,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"be clearly distinguished, an enormous posy, of red flowers apparently, perhaps of a new variety of carnation. The different parts of the Bois, so easily confounded in summer in the density and monotony of their universal green, were now clearly divided. A patch of brightness indicated the approach to almost every one of them, or else a splendid mass of foliage stood out before it like an oriflamme. I could make out, as on a coloured map, Armenonville, the Pre Catalan, Madrid, the Race Course and the shore of the lake. Here and there would appear some meaningless erection, a sham grotto, a mill, for which the trees made room by drawing away from it, or which was borne upon the soft green platform of a grassy lawn. I could feel that the Bois was not really a wood, that it existed for a purpose alien to the life of its trees; my sense of exaltation was due not only to admiration of the autumn tints but to a bodily desire. Ample source of a joy which the heart feels at first without being conscious of its cause, without understanding that it results from no external impulse! Thus I gazed at the trees with an unsatisfied longing which went beyond them and, without my knowledge, directed itself towards that masterpiece of beautiful strolling women which the trees enframed for a few hours every day. I walked towards the Allee des Acacias. I passed through forest groves in which the morning light, breaking them into new sections, lopped and trimmed the trees, united different trunks in marriage, made nosegays of their branches. It would skilfully draw towards it a pair of trees; making deft use of the sharp chisel of light and shade, it would cut away from each of them half of its trunk and branches, and, weaving together the two halves that remained, would make of them either a single pillar of shade, defined by the surrounding light, or a single luminous phantom whose artificial, quivering contour was encompassed in a network of inky shadows. When a ray of sunshine gilded the highest branches, they seemed, soaked and still dripping with a sparkling moisture, to have emerged alone from the liquid, emerald-green atmosphere in which the whole grove was plunged as though beneath the sea. For the trees continued to live by their own vitality, and when they had no longer any leaves, that vitality gleamed more brightly still from the nap of green velvet that carpeted their trunks, or in the white enamel of the globes of mistletoe that were scattered all the way up to the topmost branches of the poplars, rounded as are the sun and moon in Michelangelo's 'Creation.' But, forced for so many years now, by a sort of grafting process, to share the life of feminine humanity, they called to my mind the figure of the dryad, the fair worldling, swiftly walking, brightly coloured, whom they sheltered with their branches as she passed beneath them, and obliged to acknowledge, as they themselves acknowledged, the power of the season; they recalled to me the happy days when I was young and had faith, when I would hasten eagerly to the spots where masterpieces of female elegance would be incarnate for a few moments beneath the unconscious, accommodating boughs. But the beauty for which the firs and acacias of the Bois de Boulogne made me long, more disquieting in that respect than the chestnuts and lilacs of Trianon which I was going to see, was not fixed somewhere outside myself in the relics of an historical period, in works of art, in a little temple of love at whose door was piled an oblation of autumn leaves ribbed with gold. I reached the shore of the lake; I walked on as far as the pigeon-shooting ground. The idea of perfection which I had within me I had bestowed, in that other time, upon the height of a victoria, upon the raking thinness of those horses, frenzied and light as wasps upon the wing, with bloodshot eyes like the cruel steeds of Diomed, which now, smitten by a desire to see again what I had once loved, as ardent as the desire that had driven me, many years before, along the same paths, I wished to see renewed before my eyes at the moment when Mme. Swann's enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist, and as infantile as Saint George in the picture, endeavoured to curb the ardour of the flying, steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered along the ground. Alas! there was nothing now but motor-cars driven each by a moustached mechanic, with a tall footman towering by his side. I wished to hold before my bodily eyes, that I might know whether they were indeed as charming as they appeared to the eyes of memory, little hats, so low-crowned as to seem no more than garlands about the brows of women. All the hats now were immense; covered with fruits and flowers and all manner of birds. In place of the lovely gowns in which Mme. Swann walked like a Queen, appeared Greco-Saxon tunics, with Tanagra folds, or sometimes, in the Directoire style, 'Liberty chiffons' sprinkled with flowers like sheets of wallpaper. On the heads of the gentlemen who might have been eligible to stroll with Mme. Swann in the Allee de la Reine Marguerite, I found not the grey 'tile' hats of old, nor any other kind. They walked the Bois bare-headed. And seeing all these new elements of the spectacle, I had no longer the faith which, applied to them, would have given them consistency, unity, life; they passed in a scattered sequence before me, at random, without reality, containing in themselves no beauty that my eyes might have endeavoured as in the old days, to extract from them and to compose in a picture. They were just women, in whose elegance I had no belief, and whose clothes seemed to me unimportant. But when a belief vanishes, there survives it--more and more ardently, so as to cloak the absence of the power, now lost to us, of imparting reality to new phenomena--an idolatrous attachment to the old things which our belief in them did once animate, as if it was in that belief and not in ourselves that the divine spark resided, and as if our present incredulity had a contingent cause--the death of the gods. ""Oh, horrible!"" I exclaimed to myself: ""Does anyone really imagine that these motor-cars are as smart as the old carriage-and-pair? I dare say. I am too old now--but I was not intended for a world in which women shackle themselves in garments that are not even made of cloth. To what purpose shall I walk among these trees if there is nothing left now of the assembly that used to meet beneath the delicate tracery of reddening leaves, if vulgarity and fatuity have supplanted the exquisite thing that once their branches framed? Oh, horrible! My consolation is to think of the women whom I have known, in the past, now that there is no standard left of elegance. But how can the people who watch these dreadful creatures hobble by, beneath hats on which have been heaped the spoils of aviary or garden-bed,--how can they imagine the charm that there was in the sight of Mme. Swann, crowned with a close-fitting lilac bonnet, or with a tiny hat from which rose stiffly above her head a single iris?"" Could I ever have made them understand the emotion that I used to feel on winter mornings, when I met Mme. Swann on foot, in an otter-skin coat, with a woollen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge-feathers, but enveloped also in the deliberate, artificial warmth of her own house, which was suggested by nothing more than the bunch of violets crushed into her bosom, whose flowering, vivid and blue against the grey sky, the freezing air, the naked boughs, had the same charming effect of using the season and the weather merely as a setting, and of living actually in a human atmosphere, in the atmosphere of this woman, as had in the vases and beaupots of her drawing-room, beside the blazing fire, in front of the silk-covered sofa, the flowers that looked out through closed windows at the falling snow? But it would not have sufficed me that the costumes alone should still have been the same as in those distant years. Because of the solidarity that binds together the different parts of a general impression, parts that our memory keeps in a balanced whole, of which we are not permitted to subtract or to decline any fraction, I should have liked to be able to pass the rest of the day with one of those women, over a cup of tea, in a little house with dark-painted walls (as Mme. Swann's were still in the year after that in which the first part of this story ends) against which would glow the orange flame, the red combustion, the pink and white flickering of her chrysanthemums in the twilight of a November evening, in moments similar to those in which (as we shall see) I had not managed to discover the pleasures for which I longed. But now, albeit they had led to nothing, those moments struck me as having been charming enough in themselves. I sought to find them again as I remembered them. Alas! there was nothing now but flats decorated in the Louis XVI style, all white paint, with hortensias in blue enamel. Moreover, people did not return to Paris, now, until much later. Swann would have written to me, from a country house, that she would not be in town before February, had I asked her to reconstruct for me the elements of that memory which I felt to belong to a distant era, to a date in time towards which it was forbidden me to ascend again the fatal slope, the elements of that longing which had become, itself, as inaccessible as the pleasure that it had once vainly pursued. And I should have required also that they be the same women, those whose costume interested me because, at a time when I still had faith, my imagination had individualised them and had provided each of them with a legend. Alas! in the acacia-avenue--the myrtle-alley--I did see some of them again, grown old, no more now than grim spectres of what once they had been, wandering to and fro, in desperate search of heaven knew what, through the Virgilian groves. They had long fled, and still I stood vainly questioning the deserted paths. The sun's face was hidden. Nature began again to reign over the Bois, from which had vanished all trace of the idea that it was the Elysian Garden of Woman; above the gimcrack windmill the real sky was grey; the wind wrinkled the surface of the Grand Lac in little wavelets, like a real lake; large birds passed swiftly over the Bois, as over a real wood, and with shrill cries perched, one after another, on the great oaks which, beneath their Druidical crown, and with Dodonaic majesty, seemed to proclaim the unpeopled vacancy of this estranged forest, and helped me to understand how paradoxical it is to seek in reality for the pictures that are stored in one's memory, which must inevitably lose the charm that comes to them from memory itself and from their not being apprehended by the senses. The reality that I had known no longer existed. It sufficed that Mme. Swann did not appear, in the same attire and at the same moment, for the whole avenue to be altered. The places that we have known belong now only to the little world of space on which we map them for our own convenience. None of them was ever more than a thin slice, held between the contiguous impressions that composed our life at that time; remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.",3.2763703532944928,1.3912008553288706,0.440657150596508,0.05800622804256914,4.415451895043732,4.0,2.306220580781344,38.111111111111114,25.0,35.97255469601826,1.2745383867832847,1.0,0.6044400871742451,2058,792,0.3848396501457726,9388,54,77.70122730259295,5.561785744638624e+33,2.3687332813622758e+30,0.7109602475011686,0.7015899505752784,60.326274700356365,14.312886297376096,11.680569301951696,17.596242306446392,18.42233398121153,9.386180758017492,56.28409459021704,6.925925925925926,True,1208.0,0.8786201022146508,3.9982964224872233,2348.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009457921008844907,0.005779840616516332,0.005779840616516332,0.005779840616516332,0.0,0.0,0.012085121289079605,0.006130133987214292,0.0,0.00596252129471891,99,book_proust_en_swans-way_moncrieff_original_segments.csv_metrics
"s'arrangerait,--de son petit pas enthousiaste et saccade, regle sur les mouvements divers qu'excitaient dans son ame l'ivresse de l'orage, la puissance de l'hygiene, la stupidite de mon education et la symetrie des jardins, plutot que sur le desir inconnu d'elle d'eviter a sa jupe prune les taches de boue sous lesquelles elle disparaissait jusqu'a une hauteur qui etait toujours pour sa femme de chambre un desespoir et un probleme. Quand ces tours de jardin de ma grand'mere avaient lieu apres diner, une chose avait le pouvoir de la faire rentrer: c'etait, a un des moments ou la revolution de sa promenade la ramenait periodiquement, comme un insecte, en face des lumieres du petit salon ou les liqueurs etaient servies sur la table a jeu,--si ma grand'tante lui criait: Bathilde! viens donc empecher ton mari de boire du cognac! Pour la taquiner, en effet (elle avait apporte dans la famille de mon pere un esprit si different que tout le monde la plaisantait et la tourmentait), comme les liqueurs etaient defendues a mon grand-pere, ma grand'tante lui en faisait boire quelques gouttes. Ma pauvre grand'mere entrait, priait ardemment son mari de ne pas gouter au cognac; il se fachait, buvait tout de meme sa gorgee, et ma grand'mere repartait, triste, decouragee, souriante pourtant, car elle etait si humble de cur et si douce que sa tendresse pour les autres et le peu de cas qu'elle faisait de sa propre personne et de ses souffrances, se conciliaient dans son regard en un sourire ou, contrairement a ce qu'on voit dans le visage de beaucoup d'humains, il n'y avait d'ironie que pour elle-meme, et pour nous tous comme un baiser de ses yeux qui ne pouvaient voir ceux qu'elle cherissait sans les caresser passionnement du regard. Ce supplice que lui infligeait ma grand'tante, le spectacle des vaines prieres de ma grand'mere et de sa faiblesse, vaincue d'avance, essayant inutilement d'oter a mon grand-pere le verre a liqueur, c'etait de ces choses a la vue desquelles on s'habitue plus tard jusqu'a les considerer en riant et a prendre le parti du persecuteur assez resolument et gaiement pour se persuader a soi-meme qu'il ne s'agit pas de persecution; elles me causaient alors une telle horreur, que j'aurais aime battre ma grand'tante. Mais des que j'entendais: Bathilde, viens donc empecher ton mari de boire du cognac! deja homme par la lachete, je faisais ce que nous faisons tous, une fois que nous sommes grands, quand il y a devant nous des souffrances et des injustices: je ne voulais pas les voir; je montais sangloter tout en haut de la maison a cote de la salle d'etudes, sous les toits, dans une petite piece sentant l'iris, et que parfumait aussi un cassis sauvage pousse au dehors entre les pierres de la muraille et qui passait une branche de fleurs par la fenetre entr'ouverte. Destinee a un usage plus special et plus vulgaire, cette piece, d'ou l'on voyait pendant le jour jusqu'au donjon de Roussainville-le-Pin, servit longtemps de refuge pour moi, sans doute parce qu'elle etait la seule qu'il me fut permis de fermer a clef, a toutes celles de mes occupations qui reclamaient une inviolable solitude: la lecture, la reverie, les larmes et la volupte. Helas! je ne savais pas que, bien plus tristement que les petits ecarts de regime de son mari, mon manque de volonte, ma sante delicate, l'incertitude qu'ils projetaient sur mon avenir, preoccupaient ma grand'mere, au cours de ces deambulations incessantes, de l'apres-midi et du soir, ou on voyait passer et repasser, obliquement leve vers le ciel, son beau visage aux joues brunes et sillonnees, devenues au retour de l'age presque mauves comme les labours a l'automne, barrees, si elle sortait, par une voilette a demi relevee, et sur lesquelles, amene la par le froid ou quelque triste pensee, etait toujours en train de secher un pleur involontaire. Ma seule consolation, quand je montais me coucher, etait que maman viendrait m'embrasser quand je serais dans mon lit. Mais ce bonsoir durait si peu de temps, elle redescendait si vite, que le moment ou je l'entendais monter, puis ou passait dans le couloir a double porte le bruit leger de sa robe de jardin en mousseline bleue, a laquelle pendaient de petits cordons de paille tressee, etait pour moi un moment douloureux. Il annoncait celui qui allait le suivre, ou elle m'aurait quitte, ou elle serait redescendue. De sorte que ce bonsoir que j'aimais tant, j'en arrivais a souhaiter qu'il vint le plus tard possible, a ce que se prolongeat le temps de repit ou maman n'etait pas encore venue. Quelquefois quand, apres m'avoir embrasse, elle ouvrait la porte pour partir, je voulais la rappeler, lui dire embrasse-moi une fois encore, mais je savais qu'aussitot elle aurait son visage fache, car la concession qu'elle faisait a ma tristesse et a mon agitation en montant m'embrasser, en m'apportant ce baiser de paix, agacait mon pere qui trouvait ces rites absurdes, et elle eut voulu tacher de m'en faire perdre le besoin, l'habitude, bien loin de me laisser prendre celle de lui demander, quand elle etait deja sur le pas de la porte, un baiser de plus. Or la voir fachee detruisait tout le calme qu'elle m'avait apporte un instant avant, quand elle avait penche vers mon lit sa figure aimante, et me l'avait tendue comme une hostie pour une communion de paix ou mes levres puiseraient sa presence reelle et le pouvoir de m'endormir. Mais ces soirs-la, ou maman en somme restait si peu de temps dans ma chambre, etaient doux encore en comparaison de ceux ou il y avait du monde a diner et ou, a cause de cela, elle ne montait pas me dire bonsoir. Le monde se bornait habituellement a M. Swann, qui, en dehors de quelques etrangers de passage, etait a peu pres la seule personne qui vint chez nous a Combray, quelquefois pour diner en voisin (plus rarement depuis qu'il avait fait ce mauvais mariage, parce que mes parents ne voulaient pas recevoir sa femme), quelquefois apres le diner, a l'improviste. Les soirs ou, assis devant la maison sous le grand marronnier, autour de la table de fer, nous entendions au bout du jardin, non pas le grelot profus et criard qui arrosait, qui etourdissait au passage de son bruit ferrugineux, intarissable et glace, toute personne de la maison qui le declenchait en entrant sans sonner, mais le double tintement timide, ovale et dore de la clochette pour les etrangers, tout le monde aussitot se demandait: Une visite, qui cela peut-il etre? mais on savait bien que cela ne pouvait etre que M. Swann; ma grand'tante parlant a haute voix, pour precher d'exemple, sur un ton qu'elle s'efforcait de rendre naturel, disait de ne pas chuchoter ainsi; que rien n'est plus desobligeant pour une personne qui arrive et a qui cela fait croire qu'on est en train de dire des choses qu'elle ne doit pas entendre; et on envoyait en eclaireur ma grand'mere, toujours heureuse d'avoir un pretexte pour faire un tour de jardin de plus, et qui en profitait pour arracher subrepticement au passage quelques tuteurs de rosiers afin de rendre aux roses un peu de naturel, comme une mere qui, pour les faire bouffer, passe la main dans les cheveux de son fils que le coiffeur a trop aplatis. Nous restions tous suspendus aux nouvelles que ma grand'mere allait nous apporter de l'ennemi, comme si on eut pu hesiter entre un grand nombre possible d'assaillants, et bientot apres mon grand-pere disait: Je reconnais la voix de Swann. On ne le reconnaissait en effet qu'a la voix, on distinguait mal son visage au nez busque, aux yeux verts, sous un haut front entoure de cheveux blonds presque roux, coiffes a la Bressant, parce que nous gardions le moins de lumiere possible au jardin pour ne pas attirer les moustiques et j'allais, sans en avoir l'air, dire qu'on apportat les sirops; ma grand'mere attachait beaucoup d'importance, trouvant cela plus aimable, a ce qu'ils n'eussent pas l'air de figurer d'une facon exceptionnelle, et pour les visites seulement. M. Swann, quoique beaucoup plus jeune que lui, etait tres lie avec mon grand-pere qui avait ete un des meilleurs amis de son pere, homme excellent mais singulier, chez qui, parait-il, un rien suffisait parfois pour interrompre les elans du cur, changer le cours de la pensee. J'entendais plusieurs fois par an mon grand-pere raconter a table des anecdotes toujours les memes sur l'attitude qu'avait eue M. Swann le pere, a la mort de sa femme qu'il avait veillee jour et nuit. Mon grand-pere qui ne l'avait pas vu depuis longtemps etait accouru aupres de lui dans la propriete que les Swann possedaient aux environs de Combray, et avait reussi, pour qu'il n'assistat pas a la mise en biere, a lui faire quitter un moment, tout en pleurs, la chambre mortuaire. Ils firent quelques pas dans le parc ou il y avait un peu de soleil. Tout d'un coup, M. Swann prenant mon grand-pere par le bras, s'etait ecrie: Ah! mon vieil ami, quel bonheur de se promener ensemble par ce beau temps. Vous ne trouvez pas ca joli tous ces arbres, ces aubepines et mon etang dont vous ne m'avez jamais felicite? Vous avez l'air comme un bonnet de nuit. Sentez-vous ce petit vent? Ah! on a beau dire, la vie a du bon tout de meme, mon cher Amedee! Brusquement le souvenir de sa femme morte lui revint, et trouvant sans doute trop complique de chercher comment il avait pu a un pareil moment se laisser aller a un mouvement de joie, il se contenta, par un geste qui lui etait familier chaque fois qu'une question ardue se presentait a son esprit, de passer la main sur son front, d'essuyer ses yeux et les verres de son lorgnon. Il ne put pourtant pas se consoler de la mort de sa femme, mais pendant les deux annees qu'il lui survecut, il disait a mon",4.319882975607546,1.8995424378750931,0.33010042393781897,0.08971441416560479,4.416613823715917,4.0,2.517571062940505,40.43589743589744,32.0,30.74777029380769,1.2701331642358908,1.0,0.5899836482131116,1577,625,0.39632213062777427,7999,39,25.16546290393279,84961402658.08273,44669507.18090575,0.7152348392103848,0.7319336073674463,58.33929840820775,15.167571337983514,11.61234203265564,18.355715981334246,19.590199827650686,9.437666455294863,60.60076744223859,8.153846153846153,True,65.0,0.8827549947423764,4.205573080967403,1902.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017186044103944507,0.009938917072160679,0.009938917072160679,0.009938917072160679,0.009938917072160679,0.009938917072160679,0.004555336991406978,0.007247127031783829,0.008696552438140595,0.14458464773922186,2,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"incertitude du lieu ou je me trouvais ne distinguait pas mieux les unes des autres les diverses suppositions dont elle etait faite, que nous n'isolons, en voyant un cheval courir, les positions successives que nous montre le kinetoscope. Mais j'avais revu tantot l'une, tantot l'autre, des chambres que j'avais habitees dans ma vie, et je finissais par me les rappeler toutes dans les longues reveries qui suivaient mon reveil; chambres d'hiver ou quand on est couche, on se blottit la tete dans un nid qu'on se tresse avec les choses les plus disparates: un coin de l'oreiller, le haut des couvertures, un bout de chale, le bord du lit, et un numero des Debats roses, qu'on finit par cimenter ensemble selon la technique des oiseaux en s'y appuyant indefiniment; ou, par un temps glacial le plaisir qu'on goute est de se sentir separe du dehors (comme l'hirondelle de mer qui a son nid au fond d'un souterrain dans la chaleur de la terre), et ou, le feu etant entretenu toute la nuit dans la cheminee, on dort dans un grand manteau d'air chaud et fumeux, traverse des lueurs des tisons qui se rallument, sorte d'impalpable alcove, de chaude caverne creusee au sein de la chambre meme, zone ardente et mobile en ses contours thermiques, aeree de souffles qui nous rafraichissent la figure et viennent des angles, des parties voisines de la fenetre ou eloignees du foyer et qui se sont refroidies;--chambres d'ete ou l'on aime etre uni a la nuit tiede, ou le clair de lune appuye aux volets entr'ouverts, jette jusqu'au pied du lit son echelle enchantee, ou on dort presque en plein air, comme la mesange balancee par la brise a la pointe d'un rayon--; parfois la chambre Louis XVI, si gaie que meme le premier soir je n'y avais pas ete trop malheureux et ou les colonnettes qui soutenaient legerement le plafond s'ecartaient avec tant de grace pour montrer et reserver la place du lit; parfois au contraire celle, petite et si elevee de plafond, creusee en forme de pyramide dans la hauteur de deux etages et partiellement revetue d'acajou, ou des la premiere seconde j'avais ete intoxique moralement par l'odeur inconnue du vetiver, convaincu de l'hostilite des rideaux violets et de l'insolente indifference de la pendule qui jacassait tout haut comme si je n'eusse pas ete la;--ou une etrange et impitoyable glace a pieds quadrangulaires, barrant obliquement un des angles de la piece, se creusait a vif dans la douce plenitude de mon champ visuel accoutume un emplacement qui n'y etait pas prevu;--ou ma pensee, s'efforcant pendant des heures de se disloquer, de s'etirer en hauteur pour prendre exactement la forme de la chambre et arriver a remplir jusqu'en haut son gigantesque entonnoir, avait souffert bien de dures nuits, tandis que j'etais etendu dans mon lit, les yeux leves, l'oreille anxieuse, la narine retive, le cur battant: jusqu'a ce que l'habitude eut change la couleur des rideaux, fait taire la pendule, enseigne la pitie a la glace oblique et cruelle, dissimule, sinon chasse completement, l'odeur du vetiver et notablement diminue la hauteur apparente du plafond. L'habitude! amenageuse habile mais bien lente et qui commence par laisser souffrir notre esprit pendant des semaines dans une installation provisoire; mais que malgre tout il est bien heureux de trouver, car sans l'habitude et reduit a ses seuls moyens il serait impuissant a nous rendre un logis habitable. Certes, j'etais bien eveille maintenant, mon corps avait vire une derniere fois et le bon ange de la certitude avait tout arrete autour de moi, m'avait couche sous mes couvertures, dans ma chambre, et avait mis approximativement a leur place dans l'obscurite ma commode, mon bureau, ma cheminee, la fenetre sur la rue et les deux portes. Mais j'avais beau savoir que je n'etais pas dans les demeures dont l'ignorance du reveil m'avait en un instant sinon presente l'image distincte, du moins fait croire la presence possible, le branle etait donne a ma memoire; generalement je ne cherchais pas a me rendormir tout de suite; je passais la plus grande partie de la nuit a me rappeler notre vie d'autrefois, a Combray chez ma grand'tante, a Balbec, a Paris, a Doncieres, a Venise, ailleurs encore, a me rappeler les lieux, les personnes que j'y avais connues, ce que j'avais vu d'elles, ce qu'on m'en avait raconte. A Combray, tous les jours des la fin de l'apres-midi, longtemps avant le moment ou il faudrait me mettre au lit et rester, sans dormir, loin de ma mere et de ma grand'mere, ma chambre a coucher redevenait le point fixe et douloureux de mes preoccupations. On avait bien invente, pour me distraire les soirs ou on me trouvait l'air trop malheureux, de me donner une lanterne magique, dont, en attendant l'heure du diner, on coiffait ma lampe; et, a l'instar des premiers architectes et maitres verriers de l'age gothique, elle substituait a l'opacite des murs d'impalpables irisations, de surnaturelles apparitions multicolores, ou des legendes etaient depeintes comme dans un vitrail vacillant et momentane. Mais ma tristesse n'en etait qu'accrue, parce que rien que le changement d'eclairage detruisait l'habitude que j'avais de ma chambre et grace a quoi, sauf le supplice du coucher, elle m'etait devenue supportable. Maintenant je ne la reconnaissais plus et j'y etais inquiet, comme dans une chambre d'hotel ou de chalet, ou je fusse arrive pour la premiere fois en descendant de chemin de fer. Au pas saccade de son cheval, Golo, plein d'un affreux dessein, sortait de la petite foret triangulaire qui veloutait d'un vert sombre la pente d'une colline, et s'avancait en tressautant vers le chateau de la pauvre Genevieve de Brabant. Ce chateau etait coupe selon une ligne courbe qui n'etait autre que la limite d'un des ovales de verre menages dans le chassis qu'on glissait entre les coulisses de la lanterne. Ce n'etait qu'un pan de chateau et il avait devant lui une lande ou revait Genevieve qui portait une ceinture bleue. Le chateau et la lande etaient jaunes et je n'avais pas attendu de les voir pour connaitre leur couleur car, avant les verres du chassis, la sonorite mordoree du nom de Brabant me l'avait montree avec evidence. Golo s'arretait un instant pour ecouter avec tristesse le boniment lu a haute voix par ma grand'tante et qu'il avait l'air de comprendre parfaitement, conformant son attitude avec une docilite qui n'excluait pas une certaine majeste, aux indications du texte; puis il s'eloignait du meme pas saccade. Et rien ne pouvait arreter sa lente chevauchee. Si on bougeait la lanterne, je distinguais le cheval de Golo qui continuait a s'avancer sur les rideaux de la fenetre, se bombant de leurs plis, descendant dans leurs fentes. Le corps de Golo lui-meme, d'une essence aussi surnaturelle que celui de sa monture, s'arrangeait de tout obstacle materiel, de tout objet genant qu'il rencontrait en le prenant comme ossature et en se le rendant interieur, fut-ce le bouton de la porte sur lequel s'adaptait aussitot et surnageait invinciblement sa robe rouge ou sa figure pale toujours aussi noble et aussi melancolique, mais qui ne laissait paraitre aucun trouble de cette transvertebration. Certes je leur trouvais du charme a ces brillantes projections qui semblaient emaner d'un passe merovingien et promenaient autour de moi des reflets d'histoire si anciens. Mais je ne peux dire quel malaise me causait pourtant cette intrusion du mystere et de la beaute dans une chambre que j'avais fini par remplir de mon moi au point de ne pas faire plus attention a elle qu'a lui-meme. L'influence anesthesiante de l'habitude ayant cesse, je me mettais a penser, a sentir, choses si tristes. Ce bouton de la porte de ma chambre, qui differait pour moi de tous les autres boutons de porte du monde en ceci qu'il semblait ouvrir tout seul, sans que j'eusse besoin de le tourner, tant le maniement m'en etait devenu inconscient, le voila qui servait maintenant de corps astral a Golo. Et des qu'on sonnait le diner, j'avais hate de courir a la salle a manger, ou la grosse lampe de la suspension, ignorante de Golo et de Barbe-Bleue, et qui connaissait mes parents et le buf a la casserole, donnait sa lumiere de tous les soirs; et de tomber dans les bras de maman que les malheurs de Genevieve de Brabant me rendaient plus chere, tandis que les crimes de Golo me faisaient examiner ma propre conscience avec plus de scrupules. Apres le diner, helas, j'etais bientot oblige de quitter maman qui restait a causer avec les autres, au jardin s'il faisait beau, dans le petit salon ou tout le monde se retirait s'il faisait mauvais. Tout le monde, sauf ma grand'mere qui trouvait que c'est une pitie de rester enferme a la campagne et qui avait d'incessantes discussions avec mon pere, les jours de trop grande pluie, parce qu'il m'envoyait lire dans ma chambre au lieu de rester dehors. Ce n'est pas comme cela que vous le rendrez robuste et energique, disait-elle tristement, surtout ce petit qui a tant besoin de prendre des forces et de la volonte. Mon pere haussait les epaules et il examinait le barometre, car il aimait la meteorologie, pendant que ma mere, evitant de faire du bruit pour ne pas le troubler, le regardait avec un respect attendri, mais pas trop fixement pour ne pas chercher a percer le mystere de ses superiorites. Mais ma grand'mere, elle, par tous les temps, meme quand la pluie faisait rage et que Francoise avait precipitamment rentre les precieux fauteuils d'osier de peur qu'ils ne fussent mouilles, on la voyait dans le jardin vide et fouette par l'averse, relevant ses meches desordonnees et grises pour que son front s'imbibat mieux de la salubrite du vent et de la pluie. Elle disait: Enfin, on respire! et parcourait les allees detrempees,--trop symetriquement alignees a son gre par le nouveau jardinier depourvu du sentiment de la nature et auquel mon pere avait demande depuis le matin si le temps",4.321834090115382,1.7980770930265124,0.3316509699461683,0.07992627665254744,4.613650998068255,4.0,2.7504247285240973,45.6764705882353,33.5,72.7112421877417,1.3361236316806182,1.0,0.687738000371977,1553,675,0.4346426271732131,8211,34,22.792559262423268,7919225617.492449,4269124.322098355,0.7238081752350836,0.7122704542707652,47.43732311276091,17.990082383243067,13.451173962259375,21.129570849589033,23.13853149501913,10.68023180940116,70.33841521154503,11.264705882352942,True,67.0,0.9002695417789758,4.426415094339623,1855.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010130685847431872,0.002431364603383649,0.0,0.1606469002695418,1,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"A la RECHERCHE DU TEMPS PERDU Du Cote de Chez Swann A Monsieur Gaston Calmette _Comme un temoignage de profonde et affectueuse reconnaissance_, Marcel Proust. Longtemps, je me suis couche de bonne heure. Parfois, a peine ma bougie eteinte, mes yeux se fermaient si vite que je n'avais pas le temps de me dire: Je m'endors. Et, une demi-heure apres, la pensee qu'il etait temps de chercher le sommeil m'eveillait; je voulais poser le volume que je croyais avoir encore dans les mains et souffler ma lumiere; je n'avais pas cesse en dormant de faire des reflexions sur ce que je venais de lire, mais ces reflexions avaient pris un tour un peu particulier; il me semblait que j'etais moi-meme ce dont parlait l'ouvrage: une eglise, un quatuor, la rivalite de Francois Ier et de Charles Quint. Cette croyance survivait pendant quelques secondes a mon reveil; elle ne choquait pas ma raison mais pesait comme des ecailles sur mes yeux et les empechait de se rendre compte que le bougeoir n'etait plus allume. Puis elle commencait a me devenir inintelligible, comme apres la metempsycose les pensees d'une existence anterieure; le sujet du livre se detachait de moi, j'etais libre de m'y appliquer ou non; aussitot je recouvrais la vue et j'etais bien etonne de trouver autour de moi une obscurite, douce et reposante pour mes yeux, mais peut-etre plus encore pour mon esprit, a qui elle apparaissait comme une chose sans cause, incomprehensible, comme une chose vraiment obscure. Je me demandais quelle heure il pouvait etre; j'entendais le sifflement des trains qui, plus ou moins eloigne, comme le chant d'un oiseau dans une foret, relevant les distances, me decrivait l'etendue de la campagne deserte ou le voyageur se hate vers la station prochaine; et le petit chemin qu'il suit va etre grave dans son souvenir par l'excitation qu'il doit a des lieux nouveaux, a des actes inaccoutumes, a la causerie recente et aux adieux sous la lampe etrangere qui le suivent encore dans le silence de la nuit, a la douceur prochaine du retour. J'appuyais tendrement mes joues contre les belles joues de l'oreiller qui, pleines et fraiches, sont comme les joues de notre enfance. Je frottais une allumette pour regarder ma montre. Bientot minuit. C'est l'instant ou le malade, qui a ete oblige de partir en voyage et a du coucher dans un hotel inconnu, reveille par une crise, se rejouit en apercevant sous la porte une raie de jour. Quel bonheur, c'est deja le matin! Dans un moment les domestiques seront leves, il pourra sonner, on viendra lui porter secours. L'esperance d'etre soulage lui donne du courage pour souffrir. Justement il a cru entendre des pas; les pas se rapprochent, puis s'eloignent. Et la raie de jour qui etait sous sa porte a disparu. C'est minuit; on vient d'eteindre le gaz; le dernier domestique est parti et il faudra rester toute la nuit a souffrir sans remede. Je me rendormais, et parfois je n'avais plus que de courts reveils d'un instant, le temps d'entendre les craquements organiques des boiseries, d'ouvrir les yeux pour fixer le kaleidoscope de l'obscurite, de gouter grace a une lueur momentanee de conscience le sommeil ou etaient plonges les meubles, la chambre, le tout dont je n'etais qu'une petite partie et a l'insensibilite duquel je retournais vite m'unir. Ou bien en dormant j'avais rejoint sans effort un age a jamais revolu de ma vie primitive, retrouve telle de mes terreurs enfantines comme celle que mon grand-oncle me tirat par mes boucles et qu'avait dissipee le jour,--date pour moi d'une ere nouvelle,--ou on les avait coupees. J'avais oublie cet evenement pendant mon sommeil, j'en retrouvais le souvenir aussitot que j'avais reussi a m'eveiller pour echapper aux mains de mon grand-oncle, mais par mesure de precaution j'entourais completement ma tete de mon oreiller avant de retourner dans le monde des reves. Quelquefois, comme Eve naquit d'une cote d'Adam, une femme naissait pendant mon sommeil d'une fausse position de ma cuisse. Formee du plaisir que j'etais sur le point de gouter, je m'imaginais que c'etait elle qui me l'offrait. Mon corps qui sentait dans le sien ma propre chaleur voulait s'y rejoindre, je m'eveillais. Le reste des humains m'apparaissait comme bien lointain aupres de cette femme que j'avais quittee il y avait quelques moments a peine; ma joue etait chaude encore de son baiser, mon corps courbature par le poids de sa taille. Si, comme il arrivait quelquefois, elle avait les traits d'une femme que j'avais connue dans la vie, j'allais me donner tout entier a ce but: la retrouver, comme ceux qui partent en voyage pour voir de leurs yeux une cite desiree et s'imaginent qu'on peut gouter dans une realite le charme du songe. Peu a peu son souvenir s'evanouissait, j'avais oublie la fille de mon reve. Un homme qui dort, tient en cercle autour de lui le fil des heures, l'ordre des annees et des mondes. Il les consulte d'instinct en s'eveillant et y lit en une seconde le point de la terre qu'il occupe, le temps qui s'est ecoule jusqu'a son reveil; mais leurs rangs peuvent se meler, se rompre. Que vers le matin apres quelque insomnie, le sommeil le prenne en train de lire, dans une posture trop differente de celle ou il dort habituellement, il suffit de son bras souleve pour arreter et faire reculer le soleil, et a la premiere minute de son reveil, il ne saura plus l'heure, il estimera qu'il vient a peine de se coucher. Que s'il s'assoupit dans une position encore plus deplacee et divergente, par exemple apres diner assis dans un fauteuil, alors le bouleversement sera complet dans les mondes desorbites, le fauteuil magique le fera voyager a toute vitesse dans le temps et dans l'espace, et au moment d'ouvrir les paupieres, il se croira couche quelques mois plus tot dans une autre contree. Mais il suffisait que, dans mon lit meme, mon sommeil fut profond et detendit entierement mon esprit; alors celui-ci lachait le plan du lieu ou je m'etais endormi, et quand je m'eveillais au milieu de la nuit, comme j'ignorais ou je me trouvais, je ne savais meme pas au premier instant qui j'etais; j'avais seulement dans sa simplicite premiere, le sentiment de l'existence comme il peut fremir au fond d'un animal: j'etais plus denue que l'homme des cavernes; mais alors le souvenir--non encore du lieu ou j'etais, mais de quelques-uns de ceux que j'avais habites et ou j'aurais pu etre--venait a moi comme un secours d'en haut pour me tirer du neant d'ou je n'aurais pu sortir tout seul; je passais en une seconde par-dessus des siecles de civilisation, et l'image confusement entrevue de lampes a petrole, puis de chemises a col rabattu, recomposaient peu a peu les traits originaux de mon moi. Peut-etre l'immobilite des choses autour de nous leur est-elle imposee par notre certitude que ce sont elles et non pas d'autres, par l'immobilite de notre pensee en face d'elles. Toujours est-il que, quand je me reveillais ainsi, mon esprit s'agitant pour chercher, sans y reussir, a savoir ou j'etais, tout tournait autour de moi dans l'obscurite, les choses, les pays, les annees. Mon corps, trop engourdi pour remuer, cherchait, d'apres la forme de sa fatigue, a reperer la position de ses membres pour en induire la direction du mur, la place des meubles, pour reconstruire et pour nommer la demeure ou il se trouvait. Sa memoire, la memoire de ses cotes, de ses genoux, de ses epaules, lui presentait successivement plusieurs des chambres ou il avait dormi, tandis qu'autour de lui les murs invisibles, changeant de place selon la forme de la piece imaginee, tourbillonnaient dans les tenebres. Et avant meme que ma pensee, qui hesitait au seuil des temps et des formes, eut identifie le logis en rapprochant les circonstances, lui,--mon corps,--se rappelait pour chacun le genre du lit, la place des portes, la prise de jour des fenetres, l'existence d'un couloir, avec la pensee que j'avais en m'y endormant et que je retrouvais au reveil. Mon cote ankylose, cherchant a deviner son orientation, s'imaginait, par exemple, allonge face au mur dans un grand lit a baldaquin et aussitot je me disais: Tiens, j'ai fini par m'endormir quoique maman ne soit pas venue me dire bonsoir, j'etais a la campagne chez mon grand-pere, mort depuis bien des annees; et mon corps, le cote sur lequel je reposais, gardiens fideles d'un passe que mon esprit n'aurait jamais du oublier, me rappelaient la flamme de la veilleuse de verre de Boheme, en forme d'urne, suspendue au plafond par des chainettes, la cheminee en marbre de Sienne, dans ma chambre a coucher de Combray, chez mes grands-parents, en des jours lointains qu'en ce moment je me figurais actuels sans me les representer exactement et que je reverrais mieux tout a l'heure quand je serais tout a fait eveille. Puis renaissait le souvenir d'une nouvelle attitude; le mur filait dans une autre direction: j'etais dans ma chambre chez Mme de Saint-Loup, a la campagne; mon Dieu! Il est au moins dix heures, on doit avoir fini de diner! J'aurai trop prolonge la sieste que je fais tous les soirs en rentrant de ma promenade avec Mme de Saint-Loup, avant d'endosser mon habit. Car bien des annees ont passe depuis Combray, ou, dans nos retours les plus tardifs, c'etait les reflets rouges du couchant que je voyais sur le vitrage de ma fenetre. C'est un autre genre de vie qu'on mene a Tansonville, chez Mme de Saint-Loup, un autre genre de plaisir que je trouve a ne sortir qu'a la nuit, a suivre au clair de lune ces chemins ou je jouais jadis au soleil; et la chambre ou je me serai endormi au lieu de m'habiller pour le diner, de loin je l'apercois, quand nous rentrons, traversee par les feux de la lampe, seul phare dans la nuit. Ces evocations tournoyantes et confuses ne duraient jamais que quelques secondes; souvent, ma breve",3.741362736646207,1.946037313520723,0.32797203574156986,0.12821109586262475,4.461489088575096,4.0,2.5242329183854877,29.96153846153846,20.0,30.700138773465817,1.2862644415917843,1.0,0.6060912770400352,1558,637,0.4088575096277279,8106,52,24.8655479017431,62946305214.51865,33025343.764175575,0.7079973185763639,0.705127899646759,67.60606670287353,11.272920410783055,10.302915286807346,14.089878542510121,14.564382837957929,9.44562259306803,51.14253974523551,6.346153846153846,True,67.0,0.8819517313746065,4.252885624344176,1906.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006553348351423305,0.006553348351423305,0.004710219127585501,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.002764693835756707,0.0018431292238378046,0.003993446651648577,0.14795383001049317,0,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"grand-pere: C'est drole, je pense tres souvent a ma pauvre femme, mais je ne peux y penser beaucoup a la fois. Souvent, mais peu a la fois, comme le pauvre pere Swann, etait devenu une des phrases favorites de mon grand-pere qui la prononcait a propos des choses les plus differentes. Il m'aurait paru que ce pere de Swann etait un monstre, si mon grand-pere que je considerais comme meilleur juge et dont la sentence faisant jurisprudence pour moi, m'a souvent servi dans la suite a absoudre des fautes que j'aurais ete enclin a condamner, ne s'etait recrie: Mais comment? c'etait un cur d'or! Pendant bien des annees, ou pourtant, surtout avant son mariage, M. Swann, le fils, vint souvent les voir a Combray, ma grand'tante et mes grands-parents ne soupconnerent pas qu'il ne vivait plus du tout dans la societe qu'avait frequentee sa famille et que sous l'espece d'incognito que lui faisait chez nous ce nom de Swann, ils hebergeaient,--avec la parfaite innocence d'honnetes hoteliers qui ont chez eux, sans le savoir, un celebre brigand,--un des membres les plus elegants du Jockey-Club, ami prefere du comte de Paris et du prince de Galles, un des hommes les plus choyes de la haute societe du faubourg Saint-Germain. L'ignorance ou nous etions de cette brillante vie mondaine que menait Swann tenait evidemment en partie a la reserve et a la discretion de son caractere, mais aussi a ce que les bourgeois d'alors se faisaient de la societe une idee un peu hindoue et la consideraient comme composee de castes fermees ou chacun, des sa naissance, se trouvait place dans le rang qu'occupaient ses parents, et d'ou rien, a moins des hasards d'une carriere exceptionnelle ou d'un mariage inespere, ne pouvait vous tirer pour vous faire penetrer dans une caste superieure. M. Swann, le pere, etait agent de change; le fils Swann se trouvait faire partie pour toute sa vie d'une caste ou les fortunes, comme dans une categorie de contribuables, variaient entre tel et tel revenu. On savait quelles avaient ete les frequentations de son pere, on savait donc quelles etaient les siennes, avec quelles personnes il etait en situation de frayer. S'il en connaissait d'autres, c'etaient relations de jeune homme sur lesquelles des amis anciens de sa famille, comme etaient mes parents, fermaient d'autant plus bienveillamment les yeux qu'il continuait, depuis qu'il etait orphelin, a venir tres fidelement nous voir; mais il y avait fort a parier que ces gens inconnus de nous qu'il voyait, etaient de ceux qu'il n'aurait pas ose saluer si, etant avec nous, il les avait rencontres. Si l'on avait voulu a toute force appliquer a Swann un coefficient social qui lui fut personnel, entre les autres fils d'agents de situation egale a celle de ses parents, ce coefficient eut ete pour lui un peu inferieur parce que, tres simple de facon et ayant toujours eu une toquade d'objets anciens et de peinture, il demeurait maintenant dans un vieil hotel ou il entassait ses collections et que ma grand'mere revait de visiter, mais qui etait situe quai d'Orleans, quartier que ma grand'tante trouvait infamant d'habiter. Etes-vous seulement connaisseur? je vous demande cela dans votre interet, parce que vous devez vous faire repasser des croutes par les marchands, lui disait ma grand'tante; elle ne lui supposait en effet aucune competence et n'avait pas haute idee meme au point de vue intellectuel d'un homme qui dans la conversation evitait les sujets serieux et montrait une precision fort prosaique non seulement quand il nous donnait, en entrant dans les moindres details, des recettes de cuisine, mais meme quand les surs de ma grand'mere parlaient de sujets artistiques. Provoque par elles a donner son avis, a exprimer son admiration pour un tableau, il gardait un silence presque desobligeant et se rattrapait en revanche s'il pouvait fournir sur le musee ou il se trouvait, sur la date ou il avait ete peint, un renseignement materiel. Mais d'habitude il se contentait de chercher a nous amuser en racontant chaque fois une histoire nouvelle qui venait de lui arriver avec des gens choisis parmi ceux que nous connaissions, avec le pharmacien de Combray, avec notre cuisiniere, avec notre cocher. Certes ces recits faisaient rire ma grand'tante, mais sans qu'elle distinguat bien si c'etait a cause du role ridicule que s'y donnait toujours Swann ou de l'esprit qu'il mettait a les conter: On peut dire que vous etes un vrai type, monsieur Swann! Comme elle etait la seule personne un peu vulgaire de notre famille, elle avait soin de faire remarquer aux etrangers, quand on parlait de Swann, qu'il aurait pu, s'il avait voulu, habiter boulevard Haussmann ou avenue de l'Opera, qu'il etait le fils de M. Swann qui avait du lui laisser quatre ou cinq millions, mais que c'etait sa fantaisie. Fantaisie qu'elle jugeait du reste devoir etre si divertissante pour les autres, qu'a Paris, quand M. Swann venait le 1er janvier lui apporter son sac de marrons glaces, elle ne manquait pas, s'il y avait du monde, de lui dire: Eh bien! M. Swann, vous habitez toujours pres de l'Entrepot des vins, pour etre sur de ne pas manquer le train quand vous prenez le chemin de Lyon? Et elle regardait du coin de l'il, par-dessus son lorgnon, les autres visiteurs. Mais si l'on avait dit a ma grand'mere que ce Swann qui, en tant que fils Swann etait parfaitement qualifie pour etre recu par toute la belle bourgeoisie, par les notaires ou les avoues les plus estimes de Paris (privilege qu'il semblait laisser tomber un peu en quenouille), avait, comme en cachette, une vie toute differente; qu'en sortant de chez nous, a Paris, apres nous avoir dit qu'il rentrait se coucher, il rebroussait chemin a peine la rue tournee et se rendait dans tel salon que jamais l'il d'aucun agent ou associe d'agent ne contempla, cela eut paru aussi extraordinaire a ma tante qu'aurait pu l'etre pour une dame plus lettree la pensee d'etre personnellement liee avec Aristee dont elle aurait compris qu'il allait, apres avoir cause avec elle, plonger au sein des royaumes de Thetis, dans un empire soustrait aux yeux des mortels et ou Virgile nous le montre recu a bras ouverts; ou, pour s'en tenir a une image qui avait plus de chance de lui venir a l'esprit, car elle l'avait vue peinte sur nos assiettes a petits fours de Combray--d'avoir eu a diner Ali-Baba, lequel quand il se saura seul, penetrera dans la caverne, eblouissante de tresors insoupconnes. Un jour qu'il etait venu nous voir a Paris apres diner en s'excusant d'etre en habit, Francoise ayant, apres son depart, dit tenir du cocher qu'il avait dine chez une princesse,--Oui, chez une princesse du demi-monde! avait repondu ma tante en haussant les epaules sans lever les yeux de sur son tricot, avec une ironie sereine. Aussi, ma grand'tante en usait-elle cavalierement avec lui. Comme elle croyait qu'il devait etre flatte par nos invitations, elle trouvait tout naturel qu'il ne vint pas nous voir l'ete sans avoir a la main un panier de peches ou de framboises de son jardin et que de chacun de ses voyages d'Italie il m'eut rapporte des photographies de chefs-d'uvre. On ne se genait guere pour l'envoyer querir des qu'on avait besoin d'une recette de sauce gribiche ou de salade a l'ananas pour des grands diners ou on ne l'invitait pas, ne lui trouvant pas un prestige suffisant pour qu'on put le servir a des etrangers qui venaient pour la premiere fois. Si la conversation tombait sur les princes de la Maison de France: des gens que nous ne connaitrons jamais ni vous ni moi et nous nous en passons, n'est-ce pas, disait ma grand'tante a Swann qui avait peut-etre dans sa poche une lettre de Twickenham; elle lui faisait pousser le piano et tourner les pages les soirs ou la sur de ma grand'mere chantait, ayant pour manier cet etre ailleurs si recherche, la naive brusquerie d'un enfant qui joue avec un bibelot de collection sans plus de precautions qu'avec un objet bon marche. Sans doute le Swann que connurent a la meme epoque tant de clubmen etait bien different de celui que creait ma grand'tante, quand le soir, dans le petit jardin de Combray, apres qu'avaient retenti les deux coups hesitants de la clochette, elle injectait et vivifiait de tout ce qu'elle savait sur la famille Swann, l'obscur et incertain personnage qui se detachait, suivi de ma grand'mere, sur un fond de tenebres, et qu'on reconnaissait a la voix. Mais meme au point de vue des plus insignifiantes choses de la vie, nous ne sommes pas un tout materiellement constitue, identique pour tout le monde et dont chacun n'a qu'a aller prendre connaissance comme d'un cahier des charges ou d'un testament; notre personnalite sociale est une creation de la pensee des autres. Meme l'acte si simple que nous appelons voir une personne que nous connaissons est en partie un acte intellectuel. Nous remplissons l'apparence physique de l'etre que nous voyons, de toutes les notions que nous avons sur lui et dans l'aspect total que nous nous representons, ces notions ont certainement la plus grande part. Elles finissent par gonfler si parfaitement les joues, par suivre en une adherence si exacte la ligne du nez, elles se melent si bien de nuancer la sonorite de la voix comme si celle-ci n'etait qu'une transparente enveloppe, que chaque fois que nous voyons ce visage et que nous entendons cette voix, ce sont ces notions que nous retrouvons, que nous ecoutons. Sans doute, dans le Swann qu'ils s'etaient constitue, mes parents avaient omis par ignorance de faire entrer une foule de particularites de sa vie mondaine qui etaient cause que d'autres personnes, quand elles etaient en sa presence, voyaient les elegances regner dans son visage et s'arreter a son nez busque comme a leur frontiere naturelle; mais aussi ils avaient pu entasser dans ce visage desaffecte de son prestige, vacant et spacieux, au fond de ces yeux",4.225510418411479,1.7888886798958163,0.33490945107366016,0.09374731470013674,4.601023017902813,4.0,2.628906588027623,39.1,32.0,27.992677613976124,1.3075447570332481,1.0,0.6704728700552947,1564,624,0.3989769820971867,8181,40,21.51981343196931,2217870707.8866067,1186661.6949634065,0.7576049986558083,0.767023766511365,56.53021355498723,15.088028132992331,12.730933301510706,18.53002557544757,19.790818414322253,10.496982097186699,60.83913043478261,8.5,True,50.0,0.898876404494382,4.377207062600321,1869.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00406462757849812,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008942180672695864,0.00304847068387359,0.0,0.14178705189941146,3,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"comme cela, ces manifestations sont ridicules. Allons, monte! Et il me fallut partir sans viatique; il me fallut monter chaque marche de l'escalier, comme dit l'expression populaire, a contre-cur, montant contre mon cur qui voulait retourner pres de ma mere parce qu'elle ne lui avait pas, en m'embrassant, donne licence de me suivre. Cet escalier deteste ou je m'engageais toujours si tristement, exhalait une odeur de vernis qui avait en quelque sorte absorbe, fixe, cette sorte particuliere de chagrin que je ressentais chaque soir et la rendait peut-etre plus cruelle encore pour ma sensibilite parce que sous cette forme olfactive mon intelligence n'en pouvait plus prendre sa part. Quand nous dormons et qu'une rage de dents n'est encore percue par nous que comme une jeune fille que nous nous efforcons deux cents fois de suite de tirer de l'eau ou que comme un vers de Moliere que nous nous repetons sans arreter, c'est un grand soulagement de nous reveiller et que notre intelligence puisse debarrasser l'idee de rage de dents, de tout deguisement heroique ou cadence. C'est l'inverse de ce soulagement que j'eprouvais quand mon chagrin de monter dans ma chambre entrait en moi d'une facon infiniment plus rapide, presque instantanee, a la fois insidieuse et brusque, par l'inhalation,--beaucoup plus toxique que la penetration morale,--de l'odeur de vernis particuliere a cet escalier. Une fois dans ma chambre, il fallut boucher toutes les issues, fermer les volets, creuser mon propre tombeau, en defaisant mes couvertures, revetir le suaire de ma chemise de nuit. Mais avant de m'ensevelir dans le lit de fer qu'on avait ajoute dans la chambre parce que j'avais trop chaud l'ete sous les courtines de reps du grand lit, j'eus un mouvement de revolte, je voulus essayer d'une ruse de condamne. J'ecrivis a ma mere en la suppliant de monter pour une chose grave que je ne pouvais lui dire dans ma lettre. Mon effroi etait que Francoise, la cuisiniere de ma tante qui etait chargee de s'occuper de moi quand j'etais a Combray, refusat de porter mon mot. Je me doutais que pour elle, faire une commission a ma mere quand il y avait du monde lui paraitrait aussi impossible que pour le portier d'un theatre de remettre une lettre a un acteur pendant qu'il est en scene. Elle possedait a l'egard des choses qui peuvent ou ne peuvent pas se faire un code imperieux, abondant, subtil et intransigeant sur des distinctions insaisissables ou oiseuses (ce qui lui donnait l'apparence de ces lois antiques qui, a cote de prescriptions feroces comme de massacrer les enfants a la mamelle, defendent avec une delicatesse exageree de faire bouillir le chevreau dans le lait de sa mere, ou de manger dans un animal le nerf de la cuisse). Ce code, si l'on en jugeait par l'entetement soudain qu'elle mettait a ne pas vouloir faire certaines commissions que nous lui donnions, semblait avoir prevu des complexites sociales et des raffinements mondains tels que rien dans l'entourage de Francoise et dans sa vie de domestique de village n'avait pu les lui suggerer; et l'on etait oblige de se dire qu'il y avait en elle un passe francais tres ancien, noble et mal compris, comme dans ces cites manufacturieres ou de vieux hotels temoignent qu'il y eut jadis une vie de cour, et ou les ouvriers d'une usine de produits chimiques travaillent au milieu de delicates sculptures qui representent le miracle de saint Theophile ou les quatre fils Aymon. Dans le cas particulier, l'article du code a cause duquel il etait peu probable que sauf le cas d'incendie Francoise allat deranger maman en presence de M. Swann pour un aussi petit personnage que moi, exprimait simplement le respect qu'elle professait non seulement pour les parents,--comme pour les morts, les pretres et les rois,--mais encore pour l'etranger a qui on donne l'hospitalite, respect qui m'aurait peut-etre touche dans un livre mais qui m'irritait toujours dans sa bouche, a cause du ton grave et attendri qu'elle prenait pour en parler, et davantage ce soir ou le caractere sacre qu'elle conferait au diner avait pour effet qu'elle refuserait d'en troubler la ceremonie. Mais pour mettre une chance de mon cote, je n'hesitai pas a mentir et a lui dire que ce n'etait pas du tout moi qui avais voulu ecrire a maman, mais que c'etait maman qui, en me quittant, m'avait recommande de ne pas oublier de lui envoyer une reponse relativement a un objet qu'elle m'avait prie de chercher; et elle serait certainement tres fachee si on ne lui remettait pas ce mot. Je pense que Francoise ne me crut pas, car, comme les hommes primitifs dont les sens etaient plus puissants que les notres, elle discernait immediatement, a des signes insaisissables pour nous, toute verite que nous voulions lui cacher; elle regarda pendant cinq minutes l'enveloppe comme si l'examen du papier et l'aspect de l'ecriture allaient la renseigner sur la nature du contenu ou lui apprendre a quel article de son code elle devait se referer. Puis elle sortit d'un air resigne qui semblait signifier: C'est-il pas malheureux pour des parents d'avoir un enfant pareil! Elle revint au bout d'un moment me dire qu'on n'en etait encore qu'a la glace, qu'il etait impossible au maitre d'hotel de remettre la lettre en ce moment devant tout le monde, mais que, quand on serait aux rince-bouche, on trouverait le moyen de la faire passer a maman. Aussitot mon anxiete tomba; maintenant ce n'etait plus comme tout a l'heure pour jusqu'a demain que j'avais quitte ma mere, puisque mon petit mot allait, la fachant sans doute (et doublement parce que ce manege me rendrait ridicule aux yeux de Swann), me faire du moins entrer invisible et ravi dans la meme piece qu'elle, allait lui parler de moi a l'oreille; puisque cette salle a manger interdite, hostile, ou, il y avait un instant encore, la glace elle-meme--le granite--et les rince-bouche me semblaient receler des plaisirs malfaisants et mortellement tristes parce que maman les goutait loin de moi, s'ouvrait a moi et, comme un fruit devenu doux qui brise son enveloppe, allait faire jaillir, projeter jusqu'a mon cur enivre l'attention de maman tandis qu'elle lirait mes lignes. Maintenant je n'etais plus separe d'elle; les barrieres etaient tombees, un fil delicieux nous reunissait. Et puis, ce n'etait pas tout: maman allait sans doute venir! L'angoisse que je venais d'eprouver, je pensais que Swann s'en serait bien moque s'il avait lu ma lettre et en avait devine le but; or, au contraire, comme je l'ai appris plus tard, une angoisse semblable fut le tourment de longues annees de sa vie et personne, aussi bien que lui peut-etre, n'aurait pu me comprendre; lui, cette angoisse qu'il y a a sentir l'etre qu'on aime dans un lieu de plaisir ou l'on n'est pas, ou l'on ne peut pas le rejoindre, c'est l'amour qui la lui a fait connaitre, l'amour auquel elle est en quelque sorte predestinee, par lequel elle sera accaparee, specialisee; mais quand, comme pour moi, elle est entree en nous avant qu'il ait encore fait son apparition dans notre vie, elle flotte en l'attendant, vague et libre, sans affectation determinee, au service un jour d'un sentiment, le lendemain d'un autre, tantot de la tendresse filiale ou de l'amitie pour un camarade. Et la joie avec laquelle je fis mon premier apprentissage quand Francoise revint me dire que ma lettre serait remise, Swann l'avait bien connue aussi cette joie trompeuse que nous donne quelque ami, quelque parent de la femme que nous aimons, quand arrivant a l'hotel ou au theatre ou elle se trouve, pour quelque bal, redoute, ou premiere ou il va la retrouver, cet ami nous apercoit errant dehors, attendant desesperement quelque occasion de communiquer avec elle. Il nous reconnait, nous aborde familierement, nous demande ce que nous faisons la. Et comme nous inventons que nous avons quelque chose d'urgent a dire a sa parente ou amie, il nous assure que rien n'est plus simple, nous fait entrer dans le vestibule et nous promet de nous l'envoyer avant cinq minutes. Que nous l'aimons--comme en ce moment j'aimais Francoise--, l'intermediaire bien intentionne qui d'un mot vient de nous rendre supportable, humaine et presque propice la fete inconcevable, infernale, au sein de laquelle nous croyions que des tourbillons ennemis, pervers et delicieux entrainaient loin de nous, la faisant rire de nous, celle que nous aimons. Si nous en jugeons par lui, le parent qui nous a accoste et qui est lui aussi un des inities des cruels mysteres, les autres invites de la fete ne doivent rien avoir de bien demoniaque. Ces heures inaccessibles et suppliciantes ou elle allait gouter des plaisirs inconnus, voici que par une breche inesperee nous y penetrons; voici qu'un des moments dont la succession les aurait composees, un moment aussi reel que les autres, meme peut-etre plus important pour nous, parce que notre maitresse y est plus melee, nous nous le representons, nous le possedons, nous y intervenons, nous l'avons cree presque: le moment ou on va lui dire que nous sommes la, en bas. Et sans doute les autres moments de la fete ne devaient pas etre d'une essence bien differente de celui-la, ne devaient rien avoir de plus delicieux et qui dut tant nous faire souffrir puisque l'ami bienveillant nous a dit: Mais elle sera ravie de descendre! Cela lui fera beaucoup plus de plaisir de causer avec vous que de s'ennuyer la-haut. Helas! Swann en avait fait l'experience, les bonnes intentions d'un tiers sont sans pouvoir sur une femme qui s'irrite de se sentir poursuivie jusque dans une fete par quelqu'un qu'elle n'aime pas. Souvent, l'ami redescend seul. Ma mere ne vint pas, et sans menagements pour mon amour-propre (engage a ce que la fable de la recherche dont elle etait censee m'avoir prie de lui dire le resultat ne fut pas dementie) me fit dire par Francoise ces mots: Il n'y a pas de reponse que depuis j'ai si souvent entendu des concierges de",4.490428509209344,1.611559537075412,0.3133946682748951,0.06676130723603732,4.595621377978107,4.0,2.6145427927361324,37.8780487804878,30.0,29.780657597246737,1.3277527366387636,1.0,0.6752805131520747,1553,620,0.3992273019961365,8228,41,21.525299394042673,2230071297.86179,1191914.1089587335,0.7798171052709222,0.7925501102820421,56.0608989681655,14.849921316727656,12.44374389955997,17.95868892623247,19.154401080520785,10.440798454603993,59.44920138834357,8.170731707317072,True,59.0,0.897381079636558,4.397648316408338,1871.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008090614886731391,0.0036407766990291263,0.0,0.14056654195617316,6,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"deprecies, le vague et doux residu,--mi-memoire, mi-oubli,--des heures oisives passees ensemble apres nos diners hebdomadaires, autour de la table de jeu ou au jardin, durant notre vie de bon voisinage campagnard. L'enveloppe corporelle de notre ami en avait ete si bien bourree, ainsi que de quelques souvenirs relatifs a ses parents, que ce Swann-la etait devenu un etre complet et vivant, et que j'ai l'impression de quitter une personne pour aller vers une autre qui en est distincte, quand, dans ma memoire, du Swann que j'ai connu plus tard avec exactitude je passe a ce premier Swann,--a ce premier Swann dans lequel je retrouve les erreurs charmantes de ma jeunesse, et qui d'ailleurs ressemble moins a l'autre qu'aux personnes que j'ai connues a la meme epoque, comme s'il en etait de notre vie ainsi que d'un musee ou tous les portraits d'un meme temps ont un air de famille, une meme tonalite--a ce premier Swann rempli de loisir, parfume par l'odeur du grand marronnier, des paniers de framboises et d'un brin d'estragon. Pourtant un jour que ma grand'mere etait allee demander un service a une dame qu'elle avait connue au Sacre-Cur (et avec laquelle, a cause de notre conception des castes elle n'avait pas voulu rester en relations malgre une sympathie reciproque), la marquise de Villeparisis, de la celebre famille de Bouillon, celle-ci lui avait dit: Je crois que vous connaissez beaucoup M. Swann qui est un grand ami de mes neveux des Laumes. Ma grand'mere etait revenue de sa visite enthousiasmee par la maison qui donnait sur des jardins et ou Mme de Villeparisis lui conseillait de louer, et aussi par un giletier et sa fille, qui avaient leur boutique dans la cour et chez qui elle etait entree demander qu'on fit un point a sa jupe qu'elle avait dechiree dans l'escalier. Ma grand'mere avait trouve ces gens parfaits, elle declarait que la petite etait une perle et que le giletier etait l'homme le plus distingue, le mieux qu'elle eut jamais vu. Car pour elle, la distinction etait quelque chose d'absolument independant du rang social. Elle s'extasiait sur une reponse que le giletier lui avait faite, disant a maman: Sevigne n'aurait pas mieux dit! et en revanche, d'un neveu de Mme de Villeparisis qu'elle avait rencontre chez elle: Ah! ma fille, comme il est commun! Or le propos relatif a Swann avait eu pour effet non pas de relever celui-ci dans l'esprit de ma grand'tante, mais d'y abaisser Mme de Villeparisis. Il semblait que la consideration que, sur la foi de ma grand'mere, nous accordions a Mme de Villeparisis, lui creat un devoir de ne rien faire qui l'en rendit moins digne et auquel elle avait manque en apprenant l'existence de Swann, en permettant a des parents a elle de le frequenter. Comment elle connait Swann? Pour une personne que tu pretendais parente du marechal de Mac-Mahon! Cette opinion de mes parents sur les relations de Swann leur parut ensuite confirmee par son mariage avec une femme de la pire societe, presque une cocotte que, d'ailleurs, il ne chercha jamais a presenter, continuant a venir seul chez nous, quoique de moins en moins, mais d'apres laquelle ils crurent pouvoir juger--supposant que c'etait la qu'il l'avait prise--le milieu, inconnu d'eux, qu'il frequentait habituellement. Mais une fois, mon grand-pere lut dans un journal que M. Swann etait un des plus fideles habitues des dejeuners du dimanche chez le duc de X..., dont le pere et l'oncle avaient ete les hommes d'Etat les plus en vue du regne de Louis-Philippe. Or mon grand-pere etait curieux de tous les petits faits qui pouvaient l'aider a entrer par la pensee dans la vie privee d'hommes comme Mole, comme le duc Pasquier, comme le duc de Broglie. Il fut enchante d'apprendre que Swann frequentait des gens qui les avaient connus. Ma grand'tante au contraire interpreta cette nouvelle dans un sens defavorable a Swann: quelqu'un qui choisissait ses frequentations en dehors de la caste ou il etait ne, en dehors de sa classe sociale, subissait a ses yeux un facheux declassement. Il lui semblait qu'on renoncat d'un coup au fruit de toutes les belles relations avec des gens bien poses, qu'avaient honorablement entretenues et engrangees pour leurs enfants les familles prevoyantes; (ma grand'tante avait meme cesse de voir le fils d'un notaire de nos amis parce qu'il avait epouse une altesse et etait par la descendu pour elle du rang respecte de fils de notaire a celui d'un de ces aventuriers, anciens valets de chambre ou garcons d'ecurie, pour qui on raconte que les reines eurent parfois des bontes). Elle blama le projet qu'avait mon grand-pere d'interroger Swann, le soir prochain ou il devait venir diner, sur ces amis que nous lui decouvrions. D'autre part les deux surs de ma grand'mere, vieilles filles qui avaient sa noble nature mais non son esprit, declarerent ne pas comprendre le plaisir que leur beau-frere pouvait trouver a parler de niaiseries pareilles. C'etaient des personnes d'aspirations elevees et qui a cause de cela meme etaient incapables de s'interesser a ce qu'on appelle un potin, eut-il meme un interet historique, et d'une facon generale a tout ce qui ne se rattachait pas directement a un objet esthetique ou vertueux. Le desinteressement de leur pensee etait tel, a l'egard de tout ce qui, de pres ou de loin semblait se rattacher a la vie mondaine, que leur sens auditif,--ayant fini par comprendre son inutilite momentanee des qu'a diner la conversation prenait un ton frivole ou seulement terre a terre sans que ces deux vieilles demoiselles aient pu la ramener aux sujets qui leur etaient chers,--mettait alors au repos ses organes recepteurs et leur laissait subir un veritable commencement d'atrophie. Si alors mon grand-pere avait besoin d'attirer l'attention des deux surs, il fallait qu'il eut recours a ces avertissements physiques dont usent les medecins alienistes a l'egard de certains maniaques de la distraction: coups frappes a plusieurs reprises sur un verre avec la lame d'un couteau, coincidant avec une brusque interpellation de la voix et du regard, moyens violents que ces psychiatres transportent souvent dans les rapports courants avec des gens bien portants, soit par habitude professionnelle, soit qu'ils croient tout le monde un peu fou. Elles furent plus interessees quand la veille du jour ou Swann devait venir diner, et leur avait personnellement envoye une caisse de vin d'Asti, ma tante, tenant un numero du Figaro ou a cote du nom d'un tableau qui etait a une Exposition de Corot, il y avait ces mots: de la collection de M. Charles Swann, nous dit: Vous avez vu que Swann a les honneurs du Figaro? --Mais je vous ai toujours dit qu'il avait beaucoup de gout, dit ma grand'mere. Naturellement toi, du moment qu'il s'agit d'etre d'un autre avis que nous, repondit ma grand'tante qui, sachant que ma grand'mere n'etait jamais du meme avis qu'elle, et n'etant bien sure que ce fut a elle-meme que nous donnions toujours raison, voulait nous arracher une condamnation en bloc des opinions de ma grand'mere contre lesquelles elle tachait de nous solidariser de force avec les siennes. Mais nous restames silencieux. Les surs de ma grand'mere ayant manifeste l'intention de parler a Swann de ce mot du Figaro, ma grand'tante le leur deconseilla. Chaque fois qu'elle voyait aux autres un avantage si petit fut-il qu'elle n'avait pas, elle se persuadait que c'etait non un avantage mais un mal et elle les plaignait pour ne pas avoir a les envier. Je crois que vous ne lui feriez pas plaisir; moi je sais bien que cela me serait tres desagreable de voir mon nom imprime tout vif comme cela dans le journal, et je ne serais pas flattee du tout qu'on m'en parlat. Elle ne s'enteta pas d'ailleurs a persuader les surs de ma grand'mere; car celles-ci par horreur de la vulgarite poussaient si loin l'art de dissimuler sous des periphrases ingenieuses une allusion personnelle qu'elle passait souvent inapercue de celui meme a qui elle s'adressait. Quant a ma mere elle ne pensait qu'a tacher d'obtenir de mon pere qu'il consentit a parler a Swann non de sa femme mais de sa fille qu'il adorait et a cause de laquelle disait-on il avait fini par faire ce mariage. Tu pourrais ne lui dire qu'un mot, lui demander comment elle va. Cela doit etre si cruel pour lui. Mais mon pere se fachait: Mais non! tu as des idees absurdes. Ce serait ridicule. Mais le seul d'entre nous pour qui la venue de Swann devint l'objet d'une preoccupation douloureuse, ce fut moi. C'est que les soirs ou des etrangers, ou seulement M. Swann, etaient la, maman ne montait pas dans ma chambre. Je ne dinais pas a table, je venais apres diner au jardin, et a neuf heures je disais bonsoir et allais me coucher. Je dinais avant tout le monde et je venais ensuite m'asseoir a table, jusqu'a huit heures ou il etait convenu que je devais monter; ce baiser precieux et fragile que maman me confiait d'habitude dans mon lit au moment de m'endormir il me fallait le transporter de la salle a manger dans ma chambre et le garder pendant tout le temps que je me deshabillais, sans que se brisat sa douceur, sans que se repandit et s'evaporat sa vertu volatile et, justement ces soirs-la ou j'aurais eu besoin de le recevoir avec plus de precaution, il fallait que je le prisse, que je le derobasse brusquement, publiquement, sans meme avoir le temps et la liberte d'esprit necessaires pour porter a ce que je faisais cette attention des maniaques qui s'efforcent de ne pas penser a autre chose pendant qu'ils ferment une porte, pour pouvoir, quand l'incertitude maladive leur revient, lui opposer victorieusement le souvenir du moment ou ils l'ont fermee. Nous etions tous au jardin quand retentirent les deux coups hesitants de la clochette. On savait que c'etait Swann; neanmoins tout le monde se regarda d'un air interrogateur et on envoya ma grand'mere en reconnaissance.

"palaces ou des valets de pied de tripots, rapporter a quelque pauvre fille qui s'etonne: Comment, il n'a rien dit, mais c'est impossible! Vous avez pourtant bien remis ma lettre. C'est bien, je vais attendre encore. Et--de meme qu'elle assure invariablement n'avoir pas besoin du bec supplementaire que le concierge veut allumer pour elle, et reste la, n'entendant plus que les rares propos sur le temps qu'il fait echanges entre le concierge et un chasseur qu'il envoie tout d'un coup en s'apercevant de l'heure, faire rafraichir dans la glace la boisson d'un client,--ayant decline l'offre de Francoise de me faire de la tisane ou de rester aupres de moi, je la laissai retourner a l'office, je me couchai et je fermai les yeux en tachant de ne pas entendre la voix de mes parents qui prenaient le cafe au jardin. Mais au bout de quelques secondes, je sentis qu'en ecrivant ce mot a maman, en m'approchant, au risque de la facher, si pres d'elle que j'avais cru toucher le moment de la revoir, je m'etais barre la possibilite de m'endormir sans l'avoir revue, et les battements de mon cur, de minute en minute devenaient plus douloureux parce que j'augmentais mon agitation en me prechant un calme qui etait l'acceptation de mon infortune. Tout a coup mon anxiete tomba, une felicite m'envahit comme quand un medicament puissant commence a agir et nous enleve une douleur: je venais de prendre la resolution de ne plus essayer de m'endormir sans avoir revu maman, de l'embrasser coute que coute, bien que ce fut avec la certitude d'etre ensuite fache pour longtemps avec elle, quand elle remonterait se coucher. Le calme qui resultait de mes angoisses finies me mettait dans un allegresse extraordinaire, non moins que l'attente, la soif et la peur du danger. J'ouvris la fenetre sans bruit et m'assis au pied de mon lit; je ne faisais presque aucun mouvement afin qu'on ne m'entendit pas d'en bas. Dehors, les choses semblaient, elles aussi, figees en une muette attention a ne pas troubler le clair de lune, qui doublant et reculant chaque chose par l'extension devant elle de son reflet, plus dense et concret qu'elle-meme, avait a la fois aminci et agrandi le paysage comme un plan replie jusque-la, qu'on developpe. Ce qui avait besoin de bouger, quelque feuillage de marronnier, bougeait. Mais son frissonnement minutieux, total, execute jusque dans ses moindres nuances et ses dernieres delicatesses, ne bavait pas sur le reste, ne se fondait pas avec lui, restait circonscrit. Exposes sur ce silence qui n'en absorbait rien, les bruits les plus eloignes, ceux qui devaient venir de jardins situes a l'autre bout de la ville, se percevaient detailles avec un tel fini qu'ils semblaient ne devoir cet effet de lointain qu'a leur pianissimo, comme ces motifs en sourdine si bien executes par l'orchestre du Conservatoire que quoiqu'on n'en perde pas une note on croit les entendre cependant loin de la salle du concert et que tous les vieux abonnes,--les surs de ma grand'mere aussi quand Swann leur avait donne ses places,--tendaient l'oreille comme s'ils avaient ecoute les progres lointains d'une armee en marche qui n'aurait pas encore tourne la rue de Trevise. Je savais que le cas dans lequel je me mettais etait de tous celui qui pouvait avoir pour moi, de la part de mes parents, les consequences les plus graves, bien plus graves en verite qu'un etranger n'aurait pu le supposer, de celles qu'il aurait cru que pouvaient produire seules des fautes vraiment honteuses. Mais dans l'education qu'on me donnait, l'ordre des fautes n'etait pas le meme que dans l'education des autres enfants et on m'avait habitue a placer avant toutes les autres (parce que sans doute il n'y en avait pas contre lesquelles j'eusse besoin d'etre plus soigneusement garde) celles dont je comprends maintenant que leur caractere commun est qu'on y tombe en cedant a une impulsion nerveuse. Mais alors on ne prononcait pas ce mot, on ne declarait pas cette origine qui aurait pu me faire croire que j'etais excusable d'y succomber ou meme peut-etre incapable d'y resister. Mais je les reconnaissais bien a l'angoisse qui les precedait comme a la rigueur du chatiment qui les suivait; et je savais que celle que je venais de commettre etait de la meme famille que d'autres pour lesquelles j'avais ete severement puni, quoique infiniment plus grave. Quand j'irais me mettre sur le chemin de ma mere au moment ou elle monterait se coucher, et qu'elle verrait que j'etais reste leve pour lui redire bonsoir dans le couloir, on ne me laisserait plus rester a la maison, on me mettrait au college le lendemain, c'etait certain. Eh bien! dusse-je me jeter par la fenetre cinq minutes apres, j'aimais encore mieux cela. Ce que je voulais maintenant c'etait maman, c'etait lui dire bonsoir, j'etais alle trop loin dans la voie qui menait a la realisation de ce desir pour pouvoir rebrousser chemin. J'entendis les pas de mes parents qui accompagnaient Swann; et quand le grelot de la porte m'eut averti qu'il venait de partir, j'allai a la fenetre. Maman demandait a mon pere s'il avait trouve la langouste bonne et si M. Swann avait repris de la glace au cafe et a la pistache. Je l'ai trouvee bien quelconque, dit ma mere; je crois que la prochaine fois il faudra essayer d'un autre parfum. Je ne peux pas dire comme je trouve que Swann change, dit ma grand'tante, il est d'un vieux! Ma grand'tante avait tellement l'habitude de voir toujours en Swann un meme adolescent, qu'elle s'etonnait de le trouver tout a coup moins jeune que l'age qu'elle continuait a lui donner. Et mes parents du reste commencaient a lui trouver cette vieillesse anormale, excessive, honteuse et meritee des celibataires, de tous ceux pour qui il semble que le grand jour qui n'a pas de lendemain soit plus long que pour les autres, parce que pour eux il est vide et que les moments s'y additionnent depuis le matin sans se diviser ensuite entre des enfants. Je crois qu'il a beaucoup de soucis avec sa coquine de femme qui vit au su de tout Combray avec un certain monsieur de Charlus. C'est la fable de la ville. Ma mere fit remarquer qu'il avait pourtant l'air bien moins triste depuis quelque temps. Il fait aussi moins souvent ce geste qu'il a tout a fait comme son pere de s'essuyer les yeux et de se passer la main sur le front. Moi je crois qu'au fond il n'aime plus cette femme. Mais naturellement il ne l'aime plus, repondit mon grand-pere. J'ai recu de lui il y a deja longtemps une lettre a ce sujet, a laquelle je me suis empresse de ne pas me conformer, et qui ne laisse aucun doute sur ses sentiments au moins d'amour, pour sa femme. He bien! vous voyez, vous ne l'avez pas remercie pour l'Asti, ajouta mon grand-pere en se tournant vers ses deux belles-surs. Comment, nous ne l'avons pas remercie? je crois, entre nous, que je lui ai meme tourne cela assez delicatement, repondit ma tante Flora. Oui, tu as tres bien arrange cela: je t'ai admiree, dit ma tante Celine. Mais toi tu as ete tres bien aussi. Oui j'etais assez fiere de ma phrase sur les voisins aimables. Comment, c'est cela que vous appelez remercier! s'ecria mon grand-pere. J'ai bien entendu cela, mais du diable si j'ai cru que c'etait pour Swann. Vous pouvez etre sures qu'il n'a rien compris. Mais voyons, Swann n'est pas bete, je suis certaine qu'il a apprecie. Je ne pouvais cependant pas lui dire le nombre de bouteilles et le prix du vin! Mon pere et ma mere resterent seuls, et s'assirent un instant; puis mon pere dit: He bien! si tu veux, nous allons monter nous coucher. Si tu veux, mon ami, bien que je n'aie pas l'ombre de sommeil; ce n'est pas cette glace au cafe si anodine qui a pu pourtant me tenir si eveillee; mais j'apercois de la lumiere dans l'office et puisque la pauvre Francoise m'a attendue, je vais lui demander de degrafer mon corsage pendant que tu vas te deshabiller. Et ma mere ouvrit la porte treillagee du vestibule qui donnait sur l'escalier. Bientot, je l'entendis qui montait fermer sa fenetre. J'allai sans bruit dans le couloir; mon cur battait si fort que j'avais de la peine a avancer, mais du moins il ne battait plus d'anxiete, mais d'epouvante et de joie. Je vis dans la cage de l'escalier la lumiere projetee par la bougie de maman. Puis je la vis elle-meme; je m'elancai. A la premiere seconde, elle me regarda avec etonnement, ne comprenant pas ce qui etait arrive. Puis sa figure prit une expression de colere, elle ne me disait meme pas un mot, et en effet pour bien moins que cela on ne m'adressait plus la parole pendant plusieurs jours. Si maman m'avait dit un mot, c'aurait ete admettre qu'on pouvait me reparler et d'ailleurs cela peut-etre m'eut paru plus terrible encore, comme un signe que devant la gravite du chatiment qui allait se preparer, le silence, la brouille, eussent ete puerils. Une parole c'eut ete le calme avec lequel on repond a un domestique quand on vient de decider de le renvoyer; le baiser qu'on donne a un fils qu'on envoie s'engager alors qu'on le lui aurait refuse si on devait se contenter d'etre fache deux jours avec lui. Mais elle entendit mon pere qui montait du cabinet de toilette ou il etait alle se deshabiller et pour eviter la scene qu'il me ferait, elle me dit d'une voix entrecoupee par la colere: Sauve-toi, sauve-toi, qu'au moins ton pere ne t'ait vu ainsi attendant comme un fou! Mais je lui repetais: Viens me dire bonsoir, terrifie en voyant que le reflet de la bougie de mon pere s'elevait deja sur le mur, mais aussi usant de son approche comme d'un moyen de chantage et esperant que maman, pour eviter que mon",3.792155707984047,1.5084963862831533,0.335614984969035,0.0938788297863994,4.3799212598425195,4.0,2.4651142864466866,24.19047619047619,20.0,19.236916512687262,1.2670603674540681,1.0,0.5729616560886919,1524,591,0.38779527559055116,7893,63,22.40132143516289,5355133310.725628,2868309.218385446,0.7495216313869723,0.7481376096361974,75.08835958005251,8.795598050243719,9.236282656511921,11.565954255718035,11.294667229096362,8.730314960629919,43.48181477315335,4.666666666666667,True,69.0,0.8971612212104981,4.227637921799679,1867.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0041871663351826655,0.0041871663351826655,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0068041452946718305,0.004396524651941798,0.004396524651941798,0.13444027852169255,7,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"a le remercier intelligiblement de son vin, vous savez qu'il est delicieux et la caisse est enorme, recommanda mon grand-pere a ses deux belles-surs. Ne commencez pas a chuchoter, dit ma grand'tante. Comme c'est confortable d'arriver dans une maison ou tout le monde parle bas. Ah! voila M. Swann. Nous allons lui demander s'il croit qu'il fera beau demain, dit mon pere. Ma mere pensait qu'un mot d'elle effacerait toute la peine que dans notre famille on avait pu faire a Swann depuis son mariage. Elle trouva le moyen de l'emmener un peu a l'ecart. Mais je la suivis; je ne pouvais me decider a la quitter d'un pas en pensant que tout a l'heure il faudrait que je la laisse dans la salle a manger et que je remonte dans ma chambre sans avoir comme les autres soirs la consolation qu'elle vint m'embrasser. Voyons, monsieur Swann, lui dit-elle, parlez-moi un peu de votre fille; je suis sure qu'elle a deja le gout des belles uvres comme son papa. Mais venez donc vous asseoir avec nous tous sous la veranda, dit mon grand-pere en s'approchant. Ma mere fut obligee de s'interrompre, mais elle tira de cette contrainte meme une pensee delicate de plus, comme les bons poetes que la tyrannie de la rime force a trouver leurs plus grandes beautes: Nous reparlerons d'elle quand nous serons tous les deux, dit-elle a mi-voix a Swann. Il n'y a qu'une maman qui soit digne de vous comprendre. Je suis sure que la sienne serait de mon avis. Nous nous assimes tous autour de la table de fer. J'aurais voulu ne pas penser aux heures d'angoisse que je passerais ce soir seul dans ma chambre sans pouvoir m'endormir; je tachais de me persuader qu'elles n'avaient aucune importance, puisque je les aurais oubliees demain matin, de m'attacher a des idees d'avenir qui auraient du me conduire comme sur un pont au dela de l'abime prochain qui m'effrayait. Mais mon esprit tendu par ma preoccupation, rendu convexe comme le regard que je dardais sur ma mere, ne se laissait penetrer par aucune impression etrangere. Les pensees entraient bien en lui, mais a condition de laisser dehors tout element de beaute ou simplement de drolerie qui m'eut touche ou distrait. Comme un malade, grace a un anesthesique, assiste avec une pleine lucidite a l'operation qu'on pratique sur lui, mais sans rien sentir, je pouvais me reciter des vers que j'aimais ou observer les efforts que mon grand-pere faisait pour parler a Swann du duc d'Audiffret-Pasquier, sans que les premiers me fissent eprouver aucune emotion, les seconds aucune gaite. Ces efforts furent infructueux. A peine mon grand-pere eut-il pose a Swann une question relative a cet orateur qu'une des surs de ma grand'mere aux oreilles de qui cette question resonna comme un silence profond mais intempestif et qu'il etait poli de rompre, interpella l'autre: Imagine-toi, Celine, que j'ai fait la connaissance d'une jeune institutrice suedoise qui m'a donne sur les cooperatives dans les pays scandinaves des details tout ce qu'il y a de plus interessants. Il faudra qu'elle vienne diner ici un soir. Je crois bien! repondit sa sur Flora, mais je n'ai pas perdu mon temps non plus. J'ai rencontre chez M. Vinteuil un vieux savant qui connait beaucoup Maubant, et a qui Maubant a explique dans le plus grand detail comment il s'y prend pour composer un role. C'est tout ce qu'il y a de plus interessant. C'est un voisin de M. Vinteuil, je n'en savais rien; et il est tres aimable. Il n'y a pas que M. Vinteuil qui ait des voisins aimables, s'ecria ma tante Celine d'une voix que la timidite rendait forte et la premeditation, factice, tout en jetant sur Swann ce qu'elle appelait un regard significatif. En meme temps ma tante Flora qui avait compris que cette phrase etait le remerciement de Celine pour le vin d'Asti, regardait egalement Swann avec un air mele de congratulation et d'ironie, soit simplement pour souligner le trait d'esprit de sa sur, soit qu'elle enviat Swann de l'avoir inspire, soit qu'elle ne put s'empecher de se moquer de lui parce qu'elle le croyait sur la sellette. Je crois qu'on pourra reussir a avoir ce monsieur a diner, continua Flora; quand on le met sur Maubant ou sur Mme Materna, il parle des heures sans s'arreter. Ce doit etre delicieux, soupira mon grand-pere dans l'esprit de qui la nature avait malheureusement aussi completement omis d'inclure la possibilite de s'interesser passionnement aux cooperatives suedoises ou a la composition des roles de Maubant, qu'elle avait oublie de fournir celui des surs de ma grand'mere du petit grain de sel qu'il faut ajouter soi-meme pour y trouver quelque saveur, a un recit sur la vie intime de Mole ou du comte de Paris. Tenez, dit Swann a mon grand-pere, ce que je vais vous dire a plus de rapports que cela n'en a l'air avec ce que vous me demandiez, car sur certains points les choses n'ont pas enormement change. Je relisais ce matin dans Saint-Simon quelque chose qui vous aurait amuse. C'est dans le volume sur son ambassade d'Espagne; ce n'est pas un des meilleurs, ce n'est guere qu'un journal, mais du moins un journal merveilleusement ecrit, ce qui fait deja une premiere difference avec les assommants journaux que nous nous croyons obliges de lire matin et soir. Je ne suis pas de votre avis, il y a des jours ou la lecture des journaux me semble fort agreable..., interrompit ma tante Flora, pour montrer qu'elle avait lu la phrase sur le Corot de Swann dans le Figaro. Quand ils parlent de choses ou de gens qui nous interessent! encherit ma tante Celine. Je ne dis pas non, repondit Swann etonne. Ce que je reproche aux journaux c'est de nous faire faire attention tous les jours a des choses insignifiantes tandis que nous lisons trois ou quatre fois dans notre vie les livres ou il y a des choses essentielles. Du moment que nous dechirons fievreusement chaque matin la bande du journal, alors on devrait changer les choses et mettre dans le journal, moi je ne sais pas, les... Pensees de Pascal! (il detacha ce mot d'un ton d'emphase ironique pour ne pas avoir l'air pedant). Et c'est dans le volume dore sur tranches que nous n'ouvrons qu'une fois tous les dix ans, ajouta-t-il en temoignant pour les choses mondaines ce dedain qu'affectent certains hommes du monde, que nous lirions que la reine de Grece est allee a Cannes ou que la princesse de Leon a donne un bal costume. Comme cela la juste proportion serait retablie. Mais regrettant de s'etre laisse aller a parler meme legerement de choses serieuses: Nous avons une bien belle conversation, dit-il ironiquement, je ne sais pas pourquoi nous abordons ces sommets, et se tournant vers mon grand-pere: Donc Saint-Simon raconte que Maulevrier avait eu l'audace de tendre la main a ses fils. Vous savez, c'est ce Maulevrier dont il dit: Jamais je ne vis dans cette epaisse bouteille que de l'humeur, de la grossierete et des sottises. Epaisses ou non, je connais des bouteilles ou il y a tout autre chose, dit vivement Flora, qui tenait a avoir remercie Swann elle aussi, car le present de vin d'Asti s'adressait aux deux. Celine se mit a rire. Swann interloque reprit: Je ne sais si ce fut ignorance ou panneau, ecrit Saint-Simon, il voulut donner la main a mes enfants. Je m'en apercus assez tot pour l'en empecher. Mon grand-pere s'extasiait deja sur ignorance ou panneau, mais Mlle Celine, chez qui le nom de Saint-Simon,--un litterateur,--avait empeche l'anesthesie complete des facultes auditives, s'indignait deja: Comment? vous admirez cela? Eh bien! c'est du joli! Mais qu'est-ce que cela peut vouloir dire; est-ce qu'un homme n'est pas autant qu'un autre? Qu'est-ce que cela peut faire qu'il soit duc ou cocher s'il a de l'intelligence et du cur? Il avait une belle maniere d'elever ses enfants, votre Saint-Simon, s'il ne leur disait pas de donner la main a tous les honnetes gens. Mais c'est abominable, tout simplement. Et vous osez citer cela? Et mon grand-pere navre, sentant l'impossibilite, devant cette obstruction, de chercher a faire raconter a Swann, les histoires qui l'eussent amuse disait a voix basse a maman: Rappelle-moi donc le vers que tu m'as appris et qui me soulage tant dans ces moments-la. Ah! oui: Seigneur, que de vertus vous nous faites hair! Ah! comme c'est bien! Je ne quittais pas ma mere des yeux, je savais que quand on serait a table, on ne me permettrait pas de rester pendant toute la duree du diner et que pour ne pas contrarier mon pere, maman ne me laisserait pas l'embrasser a plusieurs reprises devant le monde, comme si c'avait ete dans ma chambre. Aussi je me promettais, dans la salle a manger, pendant qu'on commencerait a diner et que je sentirais approcher l'heure, de faire d'avance de ce baiser qui serait si court et furtif, tout ce que j'en pouvais faire seul, de choisir avec mon regard la place de la joue que j'embrasserais, de preparer ma pensee pour pouvoir grace a ce commencement mental de baiser consacrer toute la minute que m'accorderait maman a sentir sa joue contre mes levres, comme un peintre qui ne peut obtenir que de courtes seances de pose, prepare sa palette, et a fait d'avance de souvenir, d'apres ses notes, tout ce pour quoi il pouvait a la rigueur se passer de la presence du modele. Mais voici qu'avant que le diner fut sonne mon grand-pere eut la ferocite inconsciente de dire: Le petit a l'air fatigue, il devrait monter se coucher. On dine tard du reste ce soir. Et mon pere, qui ne gardait pas aussi scrupuleusement que ma grand'mere et que ma mere la foi des traites, dit: Oui, allons, vas te coucher. Je voulus embrasser maman, a cet instant on entendit la cloche du diner. Mais non, voyons, laisse ta mere, vous vous etes assez dit bonsoir",3.5364846981229734,1.7395300174285906,0.34021857811629147,0.10537854957924363,4.365028717294193,4.0,2.4983981560863144,22.070422535211268,14.0,19.54577433072584,1.2552648372686663,1.0,0.6072808956413284,1567,607,0.387364390555201,7963,71,25.404476707566772,107900647224.58289,56256854.6530672,0.6482113398079361,0.656541112864363,78.23811589383142,7.829589868502659,9.039577352567324,10.76818177732637,10.164496526061278,8.52520740268028,40.5133070278724,4.070422535211268,True,80.0,0.8832116788321168,4.151720542231491,1918.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022238387197339705,0.0051958848591915205,0.0051958848591915205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006235061831029824,0.010391769718383041,0.013093629845162632,0.11366006256517205,5,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"profit intellectuel, et surtout celui que nous procurent les belles choses en nous apprenant a chercher notre plaisir ailleurs que dans les satisfactions du bien-etre et de la vanite. Meme quand elle avait a faire a quelqu'un un cadeau dit utile, quand elle avait a donner un fauteuil, des couverts, une canne, elle les cherchait anciens, comme si leur longue desuetude ayant efface leur caractere d'utilite, ils paraissaient plutot disposes pour nous raconter la vie des hommes d'autrefois que pour servir aux besoins de la notre. Elle eut aime que j'eusse dans ma chambre des photographies des monuments ou des paysages les plus beaux. Mais au moment d'en faire l'emplette, et bien que la chose representee eut une valeur esthetique, elle trouvait que la vulgarite, l'utilite reprenaient trop vite leur place dans le mode mecanique de representation, la photographie. Elle essayait de ruser et sinon d'eliminer entierement la banalite commerciale, du moins de la reduire, d'y substituer pour la plus grande partie de l'art encore, d'y introduire comme plusieurs epaisseurs d'art: au lieu de photographies de la Cathedrale de Chartres, des Grandes Eaux de Saint-Cloud, du Vesuve, elle se renseignait aupres de Swann si quelque grand peintre ne les avait pas representes, et preferait me donner des photographies de la Cathedrale de Chartres par Corot, des Grandes Eaux de Saint-Cloud par Hubert Robert, du Vesuve par Turner, ce qui faisait un degre d'art de plus. Mais si le photographe avait ete ecarte de la representation du chef-d'uvre ou de la nature et remplace par un grand artiste, il reprenait ses droits pour reproduire cette interpretation meme. Arrivee a l'echeance de la vulgarite, ma grand'mere tachait de la reculer encore. Elle demandait a Swann si l'uvre n'avait pas ete gravee, preferant, quand c'etait possible, des gravures anciennes et ayant encore un interet au dela d'elles-memes, par exemple celles qui representent un chef-d'uvre dans un etat ou nous ne pouvons plus le voir aujourd'hui (comme la gravure de la Cene de Leonard avant sa degradation, par Morgan). Il faut dire que les resultats de cette maniere de comprendre l'art de faire un cadeau ne furent pas toujours tres brillants. L'idee que je pris de Venise d'apres un dessin du Titien qui est cense avoir pour fond la lagune, etait certainement beaucoup moins exacte que celle que m'eussent donnee de simples photographies. On ne pouvait plus faire le compte a la maison, quand ma grand'tante voulait dresser un requisitoire contre ma grand'mere, des fauteuils offerts par elle a de jeunes fiances ou a de vieux epoux, qui, a la premiere tentative qu'on avait faite pour s'en servir, s'etaient immediatement effondres sous le poids d'un des destinataires. Mais ma grand'mere aurait cru mesquin de trop s'occuper de la solidite d'une boiserie ou se distinguaient encore une fleurette, un sourire, quelquefois une belle imagination du passe. Meme ce qui dans ces meubles repondait a un besoin, comme c'etait d'une facon a laquelle nous ne sommes plus habitues, la charmait comme les vieilles manieres de dire ou nous voyons une metaphore, effacee, dans notre moderne langage, par l'usure de l'habitude. Or, justement, les romans champetres de George Sand qu'elle me donnait pour ma fete, etaient pleins ainsi qu'un mobilier ancien, d'expressions tombees en desuetude et redevenues imagees, comme on n'en trouve plus qu'a la campagne. Et ma grand'mere les avait achetes de preference a d'autres comme elle eut loue plus volontiers une propriete ou il y aurait eu un pigeonnier gothique ou quelqu'une de ces vieilles choses qui exercent sur l'esprit une heureuse influence en lui donnant la nostalgie d'impossibles voyages dans le temps. Maman s'assit a cote de mon lit; elle avait pris Francois le Champi a qui sa couverture rougeatre et son titre incomprehensible, donnaient pour moi une personnalite distincte et un attrait mysterieux. Je n'avais jamais lu encore de vrais romans. J'avais entendu dire que George Sand etait le type du romancier. Cela me disposait deja a imaginer dans Francois le Champi quelque chose d'indefinissable et de delicieux. Les procedes de narration destines a exciter la curiosite ou l'attendrissement, certaines facons de dire qui eveillent l'inquietude et la melancolie, et qu'un lecteur un peu instruit reconnait pour communs a beaucoup de romans, me paraissaient simples--a moi qui considerais un livre nouveau non comme une chose ayant beaucoup de semblables, mais comme une personne unique, n'ayant de raison d'exister qu'en soi,--une emanation troublante de l'essence particuliere a Francois le Champi. Sous ces evenements si journaliers, ces choses si communes, ces mots si courants, je sentais comme une intonation, une accentuation etrange. L'action s'engagea; elle me parut d'autant plus obscure que dans ce temps-la, quand je lisais, je revassais souvent, pendant des pages entieres, a tout autre chose. Et aux lacunes que cette distraction laissait dans le recit, s'ajoutait, quand c'etait maman qui me lisait a haute voix, qu'elle passait toutes les scenes d'amour. Aussi tous les changements bizarres qui se produisent dans l'attitude respective de la meuniere et de l'enfant et qui ne trouvent leur explication que dans les progres d'un amour naissant me paraissaient empreints d'un profond mystere dont je me figurais volontiers que la source devait etre dans ce nom inconnu et si doux de Champi qui mettait sur l'enfant, qui le portait sans que je susse pourquoi, sa couleur vive, empourpree et charmante. Si ma mere etait une lectrice infidele c'etait aussi, pour les ouvrages ou elle trouvait l'accent d'un sentiment vrai, une lectrice admirable par le respect et la simplicite de l'interpretation, par la beaute et la douceur du son. Meme dans la vie, quand c'etaient des etres et non des uvres d'art qui excitaient ainsi son attendrissement ou son admiration, c'etait touchant de voir avec quelle deference elle ecartait de sa voix, de son geste, de ses propos, tel eclat de gaite qui eut pu faire mal a cette mere qui avait autrefois perdu un enfant, tel rappel de fete, d'anniversaire, qui aurait pu faire penser ce vieillard a son grand age, tel propos de menage qui aurait paru fastidieux a ce jeune savant. De meme, quand elle lisait la prose de George Sand, qui respire toujours cette bonte, cette distinction morale que maman avait appris de ma grand'mere a tenir pour superieures a tout dans la vie, et que je ne devais lui apprendre que bien plus tard a ne pas tenir egalement pour superieures a tout dans les livres, attentive a bannir de sa voix toute petitesse, toute affectation qui eut pu empecher le flot puissant d'y etre recu, elle fournissait toute la tendresse naturelle, toute l'ample douceur qu'elles reclamaient a ces phrases qui semblaient ecrites pour sa voix et qui pour ainsi dire tenaient tout entieres dans le registre de sa sensibilite. Elle retrouvait pour les attaquer dans le ton qu'il faut, l'accent cordial qui leur preexiste et les dicta, mais que les mots n'indiquent pas; grace a lui elle amortissait au passage toute crudite dans les temps des verbes, donnait a l'imparfait et au passe defini la douceur qu'il y a dans la bonte, la melancolie qu'il y a dans la tendresse, dirigeait la phrase qui finissait vers celle qui allait commencer, tantot pressant, tantot ralentissant la marche des syllabes pour les faire entrer, quoique leurs quantites fussent differentes, dans un rythme uniforme, elle insufflait a cette prose si commune une sorte de vie sentimentale et continue. Mes remords etaient calmes, je me laissais aller a la douceur de cette nuit ou j'avais ma mere aupres de moi. Je savais qu'une telle nuit ne pourrait se renouveler; que le plus grand desir que j'eusse au monde, garder ma mere dans ma chambre pendant ces tristes heures nocturnes, etait trop en opposition avec les necessites de la vie et le vu de tous, pour que l'accomplissement qu'on lui avait accorde ce soir put etre autre chose que factice et exceptionnel. Demain mes angoisses reprendraient et maman ne resterait pas la. Mais quand mes angoisses etaient calmees, je ne les comprenais plus; puis demain soir etait encore lointain; je me disais que j'aurais le temps d'aviser, bien que ce temps-la ne put m'apporter aucun pouvoir de plus, qu'il s'agissait de choses qui ne dependaient pas de ma volonte et que seul me faisait paraitre plus evitables l'intervalle qui les separait encore de moi. C'est ainsi que, pendant longtemps, quand, reveille la nuit, je me ressouvenais de Combray, je n'en revis jamais que cette sorte de pan lumineux, decoupe au milieu d'indistinctes tenebres, pareil a ceux que l'embrasement d'un feu de Bengale ou quelque projection electrique eclairent et sectionnent dans un edifice dont les autres parties restent plongees dans la nuit: a la base assez large, le petit salon, la salle a manger, l'amorce de l'allee obscure par ou arriverait M. Swann, l'auteur inconscient de mes tristesses, le vestibule ou je m'acheminais vers la premiere marche de l'escalier, si cruel a monter, qui constituait a lui seul le tronc fort etroit de cette pyramide irreguliere; et, au faite, ma chambre a coucher avec le petit couloir a porte vitree pour l'entree de maman; en un mot, toujours vu a la meme heure, isole de tout ce qu'il pouvait y avoir autour, se detachant seul sur l'obscurite, le decor strictement necessaire (comme celui qu'on voit indique en tete des vieilles pieces pour les representations en province), au drame de mon deshabillage; comme si Combray n'avait consiste qu'en deux etages relies par un mince escalier, et comme s'il n'y avait jamais ete que sept heures du soir. A vrai dire, j'aurais pu repondre a qui m'eut interroge que Combray comprenait encore autre chose et existait a d'autres heures. Mais comme ce que je m'en serais rappele m'eut ete fourni seulement par la memoire volontaire, la memoire de l'intelligence, et comme les renseignements qu'elle donne sur le passe ne conservent rien de lui, je n'aurais jamais eu envie de songer a ce reste de Combray. Tout cela etait en realite mort pour moi. Mort a jamais? C'etait possible. Il y a beaucoup",4.340195477125627,2.51727228514201,0.35019486198153243,0.10449069730480944,4.731217616580311,4.0,2.778462610142358,35.09090909090909,30.0,27.611606734239153,1.3626943005181347,1.0,0.7202165727954155,1544,638,0.41321243523316065,8490,44,24.224451979325345,33154754904.494816,17796433.12103855,0.78390916090372,0.7806038487525213,55.933789448893094,14.175247291568539,12.834656854896906,17.326519076778148,18.399489519547814,11.176036269430053,59.50800753650495,8.568181818181818,True,70.0,0.8974771873322598,4.557165861513687,1863.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023645320197044337,0.014778325123152709,0.006502463054187192,0.006502463054187192,0.0,0.0,0.0064039408866995075,0.005320197044334975,0.0,0.166935050993022,9,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"Saint-Esprit sur laquelle s'ouvrait la petite porte laterale de son jardin; et ces rues de Combray existent dans une partie de ma memoire si reculee, peinte de couleurs si differentes de celles qui maintenant revetent pour moi le monde, qu'en verite elles me paraissent toutes, et l'eglise qui les dominait sur la Place, plus irreelles encore que les projections de la lanterne magique; et qu'a certains moments, il me semble que pouvoir encore traverser la rue Saint-Hilaire, pouvoir louer une chambre rue de l'Oiseau--a la vieille hotellerie de l'Oiseau flesche, des soupiraux de laquelle montait une odeur de cuisine qui s'eleve encore par moments en moi aussi intermittente et aussi chaude,--serait une entree en contact avec l'Au-dela plus merveilleusement surnaturelle que de faire la connaissance de Golo et de causer avec Genevieve de Brabant. La cousine de mon grand-pere,--ma grand'tante,--chez qui nous habitions, etait la mere de cette tante Leonie qui, depuis la mort de son mari, mon oncle Octave, n'avait plus voulu quitter, d'abord Combray, puis a Combray sa maison, puis sa chambre, puis son lit et ne descendait plus, toujours couchee dans un etat incertain de chagrin, de debilite physique, de maladie, d'idee fixe et de devotion. Son appartement particulier donnait sur la rue Saint-Jacques qui aboutissait beaucoup plus loin au Grand-Pre (par opposition au Petit-Pre, verdoyant au milieu de la ville, entre trois rues), et qui, unie, grisatre, avec les trois hautes marches de gres presque devant chaque porte, semblait comme un defile pratique par un tailleur d'images gothiques a meme la pierre ou il eut sculpte une creche ou un calvaire. Ma tante n'habitait plus effectivement que deux chambres contigues, restant l'apres-midi dans l'une pendant qu'on aerait l'autre. C'etaient de ces chambres de province qui,--de meme qu'en certains pays des parties entieres de l'air ou de la mer sont illuminees ou parfumees par des myriades de protozoaires que nous ne voyons pas,--nous enchantent des mille odeurs qu'y degagent les vertus, la sagesse, les habitudes, toute une vie secrete, invisible, surabondante et morale que l'atmosphere y tient en suspens; odeurs naturelles encore, certes, et couleur du temps comme celles de la campagne voisine, mais deja casanieres, humaines et renfermees, gelee exquise industrieuse et limpide de tous les fruits de l'annee qui ont quitte le verger pour l'armoire; saisonnieres, mais mobilieres et domestiques, corrigeant le piquant de la gelee blanche par la douceur du pain chaud, oisives et ponctuelles comme une horloge de village, flaneuses et rangees, insoucieuses et prevoyantes, lingeres, matinales, devotes, heureuses d'une paix qui n'apporte qu'un surcroit d'anxiete et d'un prosaisme qui sert de grand reservoir de poesie a celui qui la traverse sans y avoir vecu. L'air y etait sature de la fine fleur d'un silence si nourricier, si succulent que je ne m'y avancais qu'avec une sorte de gourmandise, surtout par ces premiers matins encore froids de la semaine de Paques ou je le goutais mieux parce que je venais seulement d'arriver a Combray: avant que j'entrasse souhaiter le bonjour a ma tante on me faisait attendre un instant, dans la premiere piece ou le soleil, d'hiver encore, etait venu se mettre au chaud devant le feu, deja allume entre les deux briques et qui badigeonnait toute la chambre d'une odeur de suie, en faisait comme un de ces grands devants de four de campagne, ou de ces manteaux de cheminee de chateaux, sous lesquels on souhaite que se declarent dehors la pluie, la neige, meme quelque catastrophe diluvienne pour ajouter au confort de la reclusion la poesie de l'hivernage; je faisais quelques pas du prie-Dieu aux fauteuils en velours frappe, toujours revetus d'un appui-tete au crochet; et le feu cuisant comme une pate les appetissantes odeurs dont l'air de la chambre etait tout grumeleux et qu'avait deja fait travailler et lever la fraicheur humide et ensoleillee du matin, il les feuilletait, les dorait, les godait, les boursouflait, en faisant un invisible et palpable gateau provincial, un immense chausson ou, a peine goutes les aromes plus croustillants, plus fins, plus reputes, mais plus secs aussi du placard, de la commode, du papier a ramages, je revenais toujours avec une convoitise inavouee m'engluer dans l'odeur mediane, poisseuse, fade, indigeste et fruitee de couvre-lit a fleurs. Dans la chambre voisine, j'entendais ma tante qui causait toute seule a mi-voix. Elle ne parlait jamais qu'assez bas parce qu'elle croyait avoir dans la tete quelque chose de casse et de flottant qu'elle eut deplace en parlant trop fort, mais elle ne restait jamais longtemps, meme seule, sans dire quelque chose, parce qu'elle croyait que c'etait salutaire pour sa gorge et qu'en empechant le sang de s'y arreter, cela rendrait moins frequents les etouffements et les angoisses dont elle souffrait; puis, dans l'inertie absolu ou elle vivait, elle pretait a ses moindres sensations une importance extraordinaire; elle les douait d'une motilite qui lui rendait difficile de les garder pour elle, et a defaut de confident a qui les communiquer, elle se les annoncait a elle-meme, en un perpetuel monologue qui etait sa seule forme d'activite. Malheureusement, ayant pris l'habitude de penser tout haut, elle ne faisait pas toujours attention a ce qu'il n'y eut personne dans la chambre voisine, et je l'entendais souvent se dire a elle-meme: Il faut que je me rappelle bien que je n'ai pas dormi (car ne jamais dormir etait sa grande pretention dont notre langage a tous gardait le respect et la trace: le matin Francoise ne venait pas l'eveiller, mais entrait chez elle; quand ma tante voulait faire un somme dans la journee, on disait qu'elle voulait reflechir ou reposer; et quand il lui arrivait de s'oublier en causant jusqu'a dire: Ce qui m'a reveillee ou j'ai reve que, elle rougissait et se reprenait au plus vite). Au bout d'un moment, j'entrais l'embrasser; Francoise faisait infuser son the; ou, si ma tante se sentait agitee, elle demandait a la place sa tisane et c'etait moi qui etais charge de faire tomber du sac de pharmacie dans une assiette la quantite de tilleul qu'il fallait mettre ensuite dans l'eau bouillante. Le dessechement des tiges les avait incurvees en un capricieux treillage dans les entrelacs duquel s'ouvraient les fleurs pales, comme si un peintre les eut arrangees, les eut fait poser de la facon la plus ornementale. Les feuilles, ayant perdu ou change leur aspect, avaient l'air des choses les plus disparates, d'une aile transparente de mouche, de l'envers blanc d'une etiquette, d'un petale de rose, mais qui eussent ete empilees, concassees ou tressees comme dans la confection d'un nid. Mille petits details inutiles,--charmante prodigalite du pharmacien,--qu'on eut supprimes dans une preparation factice, me donnaient, comme un livre ou on s'emerveille de rencontrer le nom d'une personne de connaissance, le plaisir de comprendre que c'etait bien des tiges de vrais tilleuls, comme ceux que je voyais avenue de la Gare, modifiees, justement parce que c'etaient non des doubles, mais elles-meme et qu'elles avaient vieilli. Et chaque caractere nouveau n'y etant que la metamorphose d'un caractere ancien, dans de petites boules grises je reconnaissais les boutons verts qui ne sont pas venus a terme; mais surtout l'eclat rose, lunaire et doux qui faisait se detacher les fleurs dans la foret fragile des tiges ou elles etaient suspendues comme de petites roses d'or,--signe, comme la lueur qui revele encore sur une muraille la place d'une fresque effacee, de la difference entre les parties de l'arbre qui avaient ete en couleur et celles qui ne l'avaient pas ete--me montrait que ces petales etaient bien ceux qui avant de fleurir le sac de pharmacie avaient embaume les soirs de printemps. Cette flamme rose de cierge, c'etait leur couleur encore, mais a demi eteinte et assoupie dans cette vie diminuee qu'etait la leur maintenant et qui est comme le crepuscule des fleurs. Bientot ma tante pouvait tremper dans l'infusion bouillante dont elle savourait le gout de feuille morte ou de fleur fanee une petite madeleine dont elle me tendait un morceau quand il etait suffisamment amolli. D'un cote de son lit etait une grande commode jaune en bois de citronnier et une table qui tenait a la fois de l'officine et du maitre-autel, ou, au-dessus d'une statuette de la Vierge et d'une bouteille de Vichy-Celestins, on trouvait des livres de messe et des ordonnances de medicaments, tous ce qu'il fallait pour suivre de son lit les offices et son regime, pour ne manquer l'heure ni de la pepsine, ni des vepres. De l'autre cote, son lit longeait la fenetre, elle avait la rue sous les yeux et y lisait du matin au soir, pour se desennuyer, a la facon des princes persans, la chronique quotidienne mais immemoriale de Combray, qu'elle commentait ensuite avec Francoise. Je n'etais pas avec ma tante depuis cinq minutes, qu'elle me renvoyait par peur que je la fatigue. Elle tendait a mes levres son triste front pale et fade sur lequel, a cette heure matinale, elle n'avait pas encore arrange ses faux cheveux, et ou les vertebres transparaissaient comme les pointes d'une couronne d'epines ou les grains d'un rosaire, et elle me disait: Allons, mon pauvre enfant, va-t'en, va te preparer pour la messe; et si en bas tu rencontres Francoise, dis-lui de ne pas s'amuser trop longtemps avec vous, qu'elle monte bientot voir si je n'ai besoin de rien. Francoise, en effet, qui etait depuis des annees a son service et ne se doutait pas alors qu'elle entrerait un jour tout a fait au notre delaissait un peu ma tante pendant les mois ou nous etions la. Il y avait eu dans mon enfance, avant que nous allions a Combray, quand ma tante Leonie passait encore l'hiver a Paris chez sa mere, un temps ou je connaissais si peu Francoise que, le 1er janvier, avant d'entrer chez ma grand'tante, ma mere me mettait dans la main une piece de cinq francs et me disait: Surtout ne te trompe pas de personne. Attends pour donner que tu m'entendes dire: Bonjour Francoise; en meme temps je te",5.176264110014127,1.8757597207090453,0.3425092280931646,0.06710058042161486,4.719108280254777,4.0,2.6978555711051144,60.38461538461539,42.0,46.3789382927182,1.3159235668789808,1.0,0.6351196842062591,1570,688,0.43821656050955415,8457,26,22.910069015153603,8906694439.539036,4677885.735052015,0.8814379239082336,0.8857651154200236,34.21748162665361,23.487898089171974,14.499529614371863,26.778049975502206,30.989307692307698,11.458165605095541,86.62665360117589,15.846153846153847,True,52.0,0.8865546218487395,4.441701680672269,1904.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007413264801818721,0.0026687753286547397,0.0,0.15966386554621848,11,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"de hasard en tout ceci, et un second hasard, celui de notre mort, souvent ne nous permet pas d'attendre longtemps les faveurs du premier. Je trouve tres raisonnable la croyance celtique que les ames de ceux que nous avons perdus sont captives dans quelque etre inferieur, dans une bete, un vegetal, une chose inanimee, perdues en effet pour nous jusqu'au jour, qui pour beaucoup ne vient jamais, ou nous nous trouvons passer pres de l'arbre, entrer en possession de l'objet qui est leur prison. Alors elles tressaillent, nous appellent, et sitot que nous les avons reconnues, l'enchantement est brise. Delivrees par nous, elles ont vaincu la mort et reviennent vivre avec nous. Il en est ainsi de notre passe. C'est peine perdue que nous cherchions a l'evoquer, tous les efforts de notre intelligence sont inutiles. Il est cache hors de son domaine et de sa portee, en quelque objet materiel (en la sensation que nous donnerait cet objet materiel), que nous ne soupconnons pas. Cet objet, il depend du hasard que nous le rencontrions avant de mourir, ou que nous ne le rencontrions pas. Il y avait deja bien des annees que, de Combray, tout ce qui n'etait pas le theatre et le drame de mon coucher, n'existait plus pour moi, quand un jour d'hiver, comme je rentrais a la maison, ma mere, voyant que j'avais froid, me proposa de me faire prendre, contre mon habitude, un peu de the. Je refusai d'abord et, je ne sais pourquoi, me ravisai. Elle envoya chercher un de ces gateaux courts et dodus appeles Petites Madeleines qui semblent avoir ete moules dans la valve rainuree d'une coquille de Saint-Jacques. Et bientot, machinalement, accable par la morne journee et la perspective d'un triste lendemain, je portai a mes levres une cuilleree du the ou j'avais laisse s'amollir un morceau de madeleine. Mais a l'instant meme ou la gorgee melee des miettes du gateau toucha mon palais, je tressaillis, attentif a ce qui se passait d'extraordinaire en moi. Un plaisir delicieux m'avait envahi, isole, sans la notion de sa cause. Il m'avait aussitot rendu les vicissitudes de la vie indifferentes, ses desastres inoffensifs, sa brievete illusoire, de la meme facon qu'opere l'amour, en me remplissant d'une essence precieuse: ou plutot cette essence n'etait pas en moi, elle etait moi. J'avais cesse de me sentir mediocre, contingent, mortel. D'ou avait pu me venir cette puissante joie? Je sentais qu'elle etait liee au gout du the et du gateau, mais qu'elle le depassait infiniment, ne devait pas etre de meme nature. D'ou venait-elle? Que signifiait-elle? Ou l'apprehender? Je bois une seconde gorgee ou je ne trouve rien de plus que dans la premiere, une troisieme qui m'apporte un peu moins que la seconde. Il est temps que je m'arrete, la vertu du breuvage semble diminuer. Il est clair que la verite que je cherche n'est pas en lui, mais en moi. Il l'y a eveillee, mais ne la connait pas, et ne peut que repeter indefiniment, avec de moins en moins de force, ce meme temoignage que je ne sais pas interpreter et que je veux au moins pouvoir lui redemander et retrouver intact, a ma disposition, tout a l'heure, pour un eclaircissement decisif. Je pose la tasse et me tourne vers mon esprit. C'est a lui de trouver la verite. Mais comment? Grave incertitude, toutes les fois que l'esprit se sent depasse par lui-meme; quand lui, le chercheur, est tout ensemble le pays obscur ou il doit chercher et ou tout son bagage ne lui sera de rien. Chercher? pas seulement: creer. Il est en face de quelque chose qui n'est pas encore et que seul il peut realiser, puis faire entrer dans sa lumiere. Et je recommence a me demander quel pouvait etre cet etat inconnu, qui n'apportait aucune preuve logique, mais l'evidence de sa felicite, de sa realite devant laquelle les autres s'evanouissaient. Je veux essayer de le faire reapparaitre. Je retrograde par la pensee au moment ou je pris la premiere cuilleree de the. Je retrouve le meme etat, sans une clarte nouvelle. Je demande a mon esprit un effort de plus, de ramener encore une fois la sensation qui s'enfuit. Et pour que rien ne brise l'elan dont il va tacher de la ressaisir, j'ecarte tout obstacle, toute idee etrangere, j'abrite mes oreilles et mon attention contre les bruits de la chambre voisine. Mais sentant mon esprit qui se fatigue sans reussir, je le force au contraire a prendre cette distraction que je lui refusais, a penser a autre chose, a se refaire avant une tentative supreme. Puis une deuxieme fois, je fais le vide devant lui, je remets en face de lui la saveur encore recente de cette premiere gorgee et je sens tressaillir en moi quelque chose qui se deplace, voudrait s'elever, quelque chose qu'on aurait desancre, a une grande profondeur; je ne sais ce que c'est, mais cela monte lentement; j'eprouve la resistance et j'entends la rumeur des distances traversees. Certes, ce qui palpite ainsi au fond de moi, ce doit etre l'image, le souvenir visuel, qui, lie a cette saveur, tente de la suivre jusqu'a moi. Mais il se debat trop loin, trop confusement; a peine si je percois le reflet neutre ou se confond l'insaisissable tourbillon des couleurs remuees; mais je ne puis distinguer la forme, lui demander comme au seul interprete possible, de me traduire le temoignage de sa contemporaine, de son inseparable compagne, la saveur, lui demander de m'apprendre de quelle circonstance particuliere, de quelle epoque du passe il s'agit. Arrivera-t-il jusqu'a la surface de ma claire conscience, ce souvenir, l'instant ancien que l'attraction d'un instant identique est venue de si loin solliciter, emouvoir, soulever tout au fond de moi? Je ne sais. Maintenant je ne sens plus rien, il est arrete, redescendu peut-etre; qui sait s'il remontera jamais de sa nuit? Dix fois il me faut recommencer, me pencher vers lui. Et chaque fois la lachete qui nous detourne de toute tache difficile, de toute uvre important, m'a conseille de laisser cela, de boire mon the en pensant simplement a mes ennuis d'aujourd'hui, a mes desirs de demain qui se laissent remacher sans peine. Et tout d'un coup le souvenir m'est apparu. Ce gout c'etait celui du petit morceau de madeleine que le dimanche matin a Combray (parce que ce jour-la je ne sortais pas avant l'heure de la messe), quand j'allais lui dire bonjour dans sa chambre, ma tante Leonie m'offrait apres l'avoir trempe dans son infusion de the ou de tilleul. La vue de la petite madeleine ne m'avait rien rappele avant que je n'y eusse goute; peut-etre parce que, en ayant souvent apercu depuis, sans en manger, sur les tablettes des patissiers, leur image avait quitte ces jours de Combray pour se lier a d'autres plus recents; peut-etre parce que de ces souvenirs abandonnes si longtemps hors de la memoire, rien ne survivait, tout s'etait desagrege; les formes,--et celle aussi du petit coquillage de patisserie, si grassement sensuel, sous son plissage severe et devot--s'etaient abolies, ou, ensommeillees, avaient perdu la force d'expansion qui leur eut permis de rejoindre la conscience. Mais, quand d'un passe ancien rien ne subsiste, apres la mort des etres, apres la destruction des choses, seules, plus freles mais plus vivaces, plus immaterielles, plus persistantes, plus fideles, l'odeur et la saveur restent encore longtemps, comme des ames, a se rappeler, a attendre, a esperer, sur la ruine de tout le reste, a porter sans flechir, sur leur gouttelette presque impalpable, l'edifice immense du souvenir. Et des que j'eus reconnu le gout du morceau de madeleine trempe dans le tilleul que me donnait ma tante (quoique je ne susse pas encore et dusse remettre a bien plus tard de decouvrir pourquoi ce souvenir me rendait si heureux), aussitot la vieille maison grise sur la rue, ou etait sa chambre, vint comme un decor de theatre s'appliquer au petit pavillon, donnant sur le jardin, qu'on avait construit pour mes parents sur ses derrieres (ce pan tronque que seul j'avais revu jusque-la); et avec la maison, la ville, la Place ou on m'envoyait avant dejeuner, les rues ou j'allais faire des courses depuis le matin jusqu'au soir et par tous les temps, les chemins qu'on prenait si le temps etait beau. Et comme dans ce jeu ou les Japonais s'amusent a tremper dans un bol de porcelaine rempli d'eau, de petits morceaux de papier jusque-la indistincts qui, a peine y sont-ils plonges s'etirent, se contournent, se colorent, se differencient, deviennent des fleurs, des maisons, des personnages consistants et reconnaissables, de meme maintenant toutes les fleurs de notre jardin et celles du parc de M. Swann, et les nympheas de la Vivonne, et les bonnes gens du village et leurs petits logis et l'eglise et tout Combray et ses environs, tout cela que prend forme et solidite, est sorti, ville et jardins, de ma tasse de the. Combray de loin, a dix lieues a la ronde, vu du chemin de fer quand nous y arrivions la derniere semaine avant Paques, ce n'etait qu'une eglise resumant la ville, la representant, parlant d'elle et pour elle aux lointains, et, quand on approchait, tenant serres autour de sa haute mante sombre, en plein champ, contre le vent, comme une pastoure ses brebis, les dos laineux et gris des maisons rassemblees qu'un reste de remparts du moyen age cernait ca et la d'un trait aussi parfaitement circulaire qu'une petite ville dans un tableau de primitif. A l'habiter, Combray etait un peu triste, comme ses rues dont les maisons construites en pierres noiratres du pays, precedees de degres exterieurs, coiffees de pignons qui rabattaient l'ombre devant elles, etaient assez obscures pour qu'il fallut des que le jour commencait a tomber relever les rideaux dans les salles; des rues aux graves noms de saints (desquels plusieurs seigneurs de Combray): rue Saint-Hilaire, rue Saint-Jacques ou etait la maison de ma tante, rue Sainte-Hildegarde, ou donnait la grille, et rue du",3.7266974575220533,1.5490572754132808,0.34508971362256,0.09287878066096587,4.523719165085389,4.0,2.581298053363237,28.232142857142858,21.0,26.380452091482823,1.3137254901960784,1.0,0.629444177600531,1581,647,0.4092346616065781,8164,56,30.68005116448974,21094873493345.58,10812339053.483126,0.7191294094716961,0.7274389761603541,67.0381985294118,10.92249649859944,10.608840637214634,13.721699647600978,13.992788696123611,9.751018342820998,50.43328137706696,6.267857142857143,True,58.0,0.8610968733982574,4.184520758585341,1951.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004275244299674267,0.004275244299674267,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004885993485342019,0.003257328990228013,0.0,0.14146591491542798,10,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pere me trouvat encore la si elle continuait a refuser, allait me dire: Rentre dans ta chambre, je vais venir. Il etait trop tard, mon pere etait devant nous. Sans le vouloir, je murmurai ces mots que personne n'entendit: Je suis perdu! Il n'en fut pas ainsi. Mon pere me refusait constamment des permissions qui m'avaient ete consenties dans les pactes plus larges octroyes par ma mere et ma grand'mere parce qu'il ne se souciait pas des principes et qu'il n'y avait pas avec lui de Droit des gens. Pour une raison toute contingente, ou meme sans raison, il me supprimait au dernier moment telle promenade si habituelle, si consacree, qu'on ne pouvait m'en priver sans parjure, ou bien, comme il avait encore fait ce soir, longtemps avant l'heure rituelle, il me disait: Allons, monte te coucher, pas d'explication! Mais aussi, parce qu'il n'avait pas de principes (dans le sens de ma grand'mere), il n'avait pas a proprement parler d'intransigeance. Il me regarda un instant d'un air etonne et fache, puis des que maman lui eut explique en quelques mots embarrasses ce qui etait arrive, il lui dit: Mais va donc avec lui, puisque tu disais justement que tu n'as pas envie de dormir, reste un peu dans sa chambre, moi je n'ai besoin de rien. Mais, mon ami, repondit timidement ma mere, que j'aie envie ou non de dormir, ne change rien a la chose, on ne peut pas habituer cet enfant... Mais il ne s'agit pas d'habituer, dit mon pere en haussant les epaules, tu vois bien que ce petit a du chagrin, il a l'air desole, cet enfant; voyons, nous ne sommes pas des bourreaux! Quand tu l'auras rendu malade, tu seras bien avancee! Puisqu'il y a deux lits dans sa chambre, dis donc a Francoise de te preparer le grand lit et couche pour cette nuit aupres de lui. Allons, bonsoir, moi qui ne suis pas si nerveux que vous, je vais me coucher. On ne pouvait pas remercier mon pere; on l'eut agace par ce qu'il appelait des sensibleries. Je restai sans oser faire un mouvement; il etait encore devant nous, grand, dans sa robe de nuit blanche sous le cachemire de l'Inde violet et rose qu'il nouait autour de sa tete depuis qu'il avait des nevralgies, avec le geste d'Abraham dans la gravure d'apres Benozzo Gozzoli que m'avait donnee M. Swann, disant a Sarah qu'elle a a se departir du cote d'Isaac. Il y a bien des annees de cela. La muraille de l'escalier, ou je vis monter le reflet de sa bougie n'existe plus depuis longtemps. En moi aussi bien des choses ont ete detruites que je croyais devoir durer toujours et de nouvelles se sont edifiees donnant naissance a des peines et a des joies nouvelles que je n'aurais pu prevoir alors, de meme que les anciennes me sont devenues difficiles a comprendre. Il y a bien longtemps aussi que mon pere a cesse de pouvoir dire a maman: Va avec le petit. La possibilite de telles heures ne renaitra jamais pour moi. Mais depuis peu de temps, je recommence a tres bien percevoir si je prete l'oreille, les sanglots que j'eus la force de contenir devant mon pere et qui n'eclaterent que quand je me retrouvai seul avec maman. En realite ils n'ont jamais cesse; et c'est seulement parce que la vie se tait maintenant davantage autour de moi que je les entends de nouveau, comme ces cloches de couvents que couvrent si bien les bruits de la ville pendant le jour qu'on les croirait arretees mais qui se remettent a sonner dans le silence du soir. Maman passa cette nuit-la dans ma chambre; au moment ou je venais de commettre une faute telle que je m'attendais a etre oblige de quitter la maison, mes parents m'accordaient plus que je n'eusse jamais obtenu d'eux comme recompense d'une belle action. Meme a l'heure ou elle se manifestait par cette grace, la conduite de mon pere a mon egard gardait ce quelque chose d'arbitraire et d'immerite qui la caracterisait et qui tenait a ce que generalement elle resultait plutot de convenances fortuites que d'un plan premedite. Peut-etre meme que ce que j'appelais sa severite, quand il m'envoyait me coucher, meritait moins ce nom que celle de ma mere ou ma grand'mere, car sa nature, plus differente en certains points de la mienne que n'etait la leur, n'avait probablement pas devine jusqu'ici combien j'etais malheureux tous les soirs, ce que ma mere et ma grand'mere savaient bien; mais elles m'aimaient assez pour ne pas consentir a m'epargner de la souffrance, elles voulaient m'apprendre a la dominer afin de diminuer ma sensibilite nerveuse et fortifier ma volonte. Pour mon pere, dont l'affection pour moi etait d'une autre sorte, je ne sais pas s'il aurait eu ce courage: pour une fois ou il venait de comprendre que j'avais du chagrin, il avait dit a ma mere: Va donc le consoler. Maman resta cette nuit-la dans ma chambre et, comme pour ne gater d'aucun remords ces heures si differentes de ce que j'avais eu le droit d'esperer, quand Francoise, comprenant qu'il se passait quelque chose d'extraordinaire en voyant maman assise pres de moi, qui me tenait la main et me laissait pleurer sans me gronder, lui demanda: Mais Madame, qu'a donc Monsieur a pleurer ainsi? maman lui repondit: Mais il ne sait pas lui-meme, Francoise, il est enerve; preparez-moi vite le grand lit et montez vous coucher. Ainsi, pour la premiere fois, ma tristesse n'etait plus consideree comme une faute punissable mais comme un mal involontaire qu'on venait de reconnaitre officiellement, comme un etat nerveux dont je n'etais pas responsable; j'avais le soulagement de n'avoir plus a meler de scrupules a l'amertume de mes larmes, je pouvais pleurer sans peche. Je n'etais pas non plus mediocrement fier vis-a-vis de Francoise de ce retour des choses humaines, qui, une heure apres que maman avait refuse de monter dans ma chambre et m'avait fait dedaigneusement repondre que je devrais dormir, m'elevait a la dignite de grande personne et m'avait fait atteindre tout d'un coup a une sorte de puberte du chagrin, d'emancipation des larmes. J'aurais du etre heureux: je ne l'etais pas. Il me semblait que ma mere venait de me faire une premiere concession qui devait lui etre douloureuse, que c'etait une premiere abdication de sa part devant l'ideal qu'elle avait concu pour moi, et que pour la premiere fois, elle, si courageuse, s'avouait vaincue. Il me semblait que si je venais de remporter une victoire c'etait contre elle, que j'avais reussi comme auraient pu faire la maladie, des chagrins, ou l'age, a detendre sa volonte, a faire flechir sa raison et que cette soiree commencait une ere, resterait comme une triste date. Si j'avais ose maintenant, j'aurais dit a maman: Non je ne veux pas, ne couche pas ici. Mais je connaissais la sagesse pratique, realiste comme on dirait aujourd'hui, qui temperait en elle la nature ardemment idealiste de ma grand'mere, et je savais que, maintenant que le mal etait fait, elle aimerait mieux m'en laisser du moins gouter le plaisir calmant et ne pas deranger mon pere. Certes, le beau visage de ma mere brillait encore de jeunesse ce soir-la ou elle me tenait si doucement les mains et cherchait a arreter mes larmes; mais justement il me semblait que cela n'aurait pas du etre, sa colere eut ete moins triste pour moi que cette douceur nouvelle que n'avait pas connue mon enfance; il me semblait que je venais d'une main impie et secrete de tracer dans son ame une premiere ride et d'y faire apparaitre un premier cheveu blanc. Cette pensee redoubla mes sanglots et alors je vis maman, qui jamais ne se laissait aller a aucun attendrissement avec moi, etre tout d'un coup gagnee par le mien et essayer de retenir une envie de pleurer. Comme elle sentit que je m'en etais apercu, elle me dit en riant: Voila mon petit jaunet, mon petit serin, qui va rendre sa maman aussi betasse que lui, pour peu que cela continue. Voyons, puisque tu n'as pas sommeil ni ta maman non plus, ne restons pas a nous enerver, faisons quelque chose, prenons un de tes livres. Mais je n'en avais pas la. Est-ce que tu aurais moins de plaisir si je sortais deja les livres que ta grand'mere doit te donner pour ta fete? Pense bien: tu ne seras pas decu de ne rien avoir apres-demain? J'etais au contraire enchante et maman alla chercher un paquet de livres dont je ne pus deviner, a travers le papier qui les enveloppait, que la taille courte et large, mais qui, sous ce premier aspect, pourtant sommaire et voile, eclipsaient deja la boite a couleurs du Jour de l'An et les vers a soie de l'an dernier. C'etait la Mare au Diable, Francois le Champi, la Petite Fadette et les Maitres Sonneurs. Ma grand'mere, ai-je su depuis, avait d'abord choisi les poesies de Musset, un volume de Rousseau et Indiana; car si elle jugeait les lectures futiles aussi malsaines que les bonbons et les patisseries, elles ne pensait pas que les grands souffles du genie eussent sur l'esprit meme d'un enfant une influence plus dangereuse et moins vivifiante que sur son corps le grand air et le vent du large. Mais mon pere l'ayant presque traitee de folle en apprenant les livres qu'elle voulait me donner, elle etait retournee elle-meme a Jouy-le-Vicomte chez le libraire pour que je ne risquasse pas de ne pas avoir mon cadeau (c'etait un jour brulant et elle etait rentree si souffrante que le medecin avait averti ma mere de ne pas la laisser se fatiguer ainsi) et elle s'etait rabattue sur les quatre romans champetres de George Sand. Ma fille, disait-elle a maman, je ne pourrais me decider a donner a cet enfant quelque chose de mal ecrit. En realite, elle ne se resignait jamais a rien acheter dont on ne put tirer un",3.9963814031981113,1.6820093979506718,0.32275157764021495,0.10000476358965876,4.327132777421424,4.0,2.428867743233723,27.350877192982455,24.0,18.93802563679768,1.2796664528543937,1.0,0.5786812475315734,1559,586,0.3758819756254009,7834,57,23.90764902203915,24152386258.494045,12785805.32477186,0.7301336868799159,0.7283552356741645,70.81407773764113,10.176906248945006,9.638236332069999,12.83900385987419,12.626233978146132,8.561308531109685,46.52983806533653,5.245614035087719,True,79.0,0.8893594494441504,4.14716781365802,1889.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0227512112913419,0.006109121550452918,0.006109121550452918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007583737097113966,0.006319780914261639,0.0,0.13710958178930652,8,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"toucherai legerement le bras. A peine arrivions-nous dans l'obscure antichambre de ma tante que nous apercevions dans l'ombre, sous les tuyaux d'un bonnet eblouissant, raide et fragile comme s'il avait ete de sucre file, les remous concentriques d'un sourire de reconnaissance anticipe. C'etait Francoise, immobile et debout dans l'encadrement de la petite porte du corridor comme une statue de sainte dans sa niche. Quand on etait un peu habitue a ces tenebres de chapelle, on distinguait sur son visage l'amour desinteresse de l'humanite, le respect attendri pour les hautes classes qu'exaltait dans les meilleures regions de son cur l'espoir des etrennes. Maman me pincait le bras avec violence et disait d'une voix forte: Bonjour Francoise. A ce signal mes doigts s'ouvraient et je lachais la piece qui trouvait pour la recevoir une main confuse, mais tendue. Mais depuis que nous allions a Combray je ne connaissais personne mieux que Francoise; nous etions ses preferes, elle avait pour nous, au moins pendant les premieres annees, avec autant de consideration que pour ma tante, un gout plus vif, parce que nous ajoutions, au prestige de faire partie de la famille (elle avait pour les liens invisibles que noue entre les membres d'une famille la circulation d'un meme sang, autant de respect qu'un tragique grec), le charme de n'etre pas ses maitres habituels. Aussi, avec quelle joie elle nous recevait, nous plaignant de n'avoir pas encore plus beau temps, le jour de notre arrivee, la veille de Paques, ou souvent il faisait un vent glacial, quand maman lui demandait des nouvelles de sa fille et de ses neveux, si son petit-fils etait gentil, ce qu'on comptait faire de lui, s'il ressemblerait a sa grand'mere. Et quand il n'y avait plus de monde la, maman qui savait que Francoise pleurait encore ses parents morts depuis des annees, lui parlait d'eux avec douceur, lui demandait mille details sur ce qu'avait ete leur vie. Elle avait devine que Francoise n'aimait pas son gendre et qu'il lui gatait le plaisir qu'elle avait a etre avec sa fille, avec qui elle ne causait pas aussi librement quand il etait la. Aussi, quand Francoise allait les voir, a quelques lieues de Combray, maman lui disait en souriant: N'est-ce pas Francoise, si Julien a ete oblige de s'absenter et si vous avez Marguerite a vous toute seule pour toute la journee, vous serez desolee, mais vous vous ferez une raison? Et Francoise disait en riant: Madame sait tout; madame est pire que les rayons X (elle disait x avec une difficulte affectee et un sourire pour se railler elle-meme, ignorante, d'employer ce terme savant), qu'on a fait venir pour Mme Octave et qui voient ce que vous avez dans le cur, et disparaissait, confuse qu'on s'occupat d'elle, peut-etre pour qu'on ne la vit pas pleurer; maman etait la premiere personne qui lui donnat cette douce emotion de sentir que sa vie, ses bonheurs, ses chagrins de paysanne pouvaient presenter de l'interet, etre un motif de joie ou de tristesse pour une autre qu'elle-meme. Ma tante se resignait a se priver un peu d'elle pendant notre sejour, sachant combien ma mere appreciait le service de cette bonne si intelligente et active, qui etait aussi belle des cinq heures du matin dans sa cuisine, sous son bonnet dont le tuyautage eclatant et fixe avait l'air d'etre en biscuit, que pour aller a la grand'messe; qui faisait tout bien, travaillant comme un cheval, qu'elle fut bien portante ou non, mais sans bruit, sans avoir l'air de rien faire, la seule des bonnes de ma tante qui, quand maman demandait de l'eau chaude ou du cafe noir, les apportait vraiment bouillants; elle etait un de ces serviteurs qui, dans une maison, sont a la fois ceux qui deplaisent le plus au premier abord a un etranger, peut-etre parce qu'ils ne prennent pas la peine de faire sa conquete et n'ont pas pour lui de prevenance, sachant tres bien qu'ils n'ont aucun besoin de lui, qu'on cesserait de le recevoir plutot que de les renvoyer; et qui sont en revanche ceux a qui tiennent le plus les maitres qui ont eprouve leur capacites reelles, et ne se soucient pas de cet agrement superficiel, de ce bavardage servile qui fait favorablement impression a un visiteur, mais qui recouvre souvent une ineducable nullite. Quand Francoise, apres avoir veille a ce que mes parents eussent tout ce qu'il leur fallait, remontait une premiere fois chez ma tante pour lui donner sa pepsine et lui demander ce qu'elle prendrait pour dejeuner, il etait bien rare qu'il ne fallut pas donner deja son avis ou fournir des explications sur quelque evenement d'importance: --Francoise, imaginez-vous que Mme Goupil est passee plus d'un quart d'heure en retard pour aller chercher sa sur; pour peu qu'elle s'attarde sur son chemin cela ne me surprendrait point qu'elle arrive apres l'elevation. --He! il n'y aurait rien d'etonnant, repondait Francoise. --Francoise, vous seriez venue cinq minutes plus tot, vous auriez vu passer Mme Imbert qui tenait des asperges deux fois grosses comme celles de la mere Callot; tachez donc de savoir par sa bonne ou elle les a eues. Vous qui, cette annee, nous mettez des asperges a toutes les sauces, vous auriez pu en prendre de pareilles pour nos voyageurs. --Il n'y aurait rien d'etonnant qu'elles viennent de chez M. le Cure, disait Francoise. --Ah! je vous crois bien, ma pauvre Francoise, repondait ma tante en haussant les epaules, chez M. le Cure! Vous savez bien qu'il ne fait pousser que de petites mechantes asperges de rien. Je vous dis que celles-la etaient grosses comme le bras. Pas comme le votre, bien sur, mais comme mon pauvre bras qui a encore tant maigri cette annee. --Francoise, vous n'avez pas entendu ce carillon qui m'a casse la tete? --Non, madame Octave. --Ah! ma pauvre fille, il faut que vous l'ayez solide votre tete, vous pouvez remercier le Bon Dieu. C'etait la Maguelone qui etait venue chercher le docteur Piperaud. Il est ressorti tout de suite avec elle et ils ont tourne par la rue de l'Oiseau. Il faut qu'il y ait quelque enfant de malade. --Eh! la, mon Dieu, soupirait Francoise, qui ne pouvait pas entendre parler d'un malheur arrive a un inconnu, meme dans une partie du monde eloignee, sans commencer a gemir. --Francoise, mais pour qui donc a-t-on sonne la cloche des morts? Ah! mon Dieu, ce sera pour Mme Rousseau. Voila-t-il pas que j'avais oublie qu'elle a passe l'autre nuit. Ah! il est temps que le Bon Dieu me rappelle, je ne sais plus ce que j'ai fait de ma tete depuis la mort de mon pauvre Octave. Mais je vous fais perdre votre temps, ma fille. --Mais non, madame Octave, mon temps n'est pas si cher; celui qui l'a fait ne nous l'a pas vendu. Je vas seulement voir si mon feu ne s'eteint pas. Ainsi Francoise et ma tante appreciaient-elles ensemble au cours de cette seance matinale, les premiers evenements du jour. Mais quelquefois ces evenements revetaient un caractere si mysterieux et si grave que ma tante sentait qu'elle ne pourrait pas attendre le moment ou Francoise monterait, et quatre coups de sonnette formidables retentissaient dans la maison. --Mais, madame Octave, ce n'est pas encore l'heure de la pepsine, disait Francoise. Est-ce que vous vous etes senti une faiblesse? --Mais non, Francoise, disait ma tante, c'est-a-dire si, vous savez bien que maintenant les moments ou je n'ai pas de faiblesse sont bien rares; un jour je passerai comme Mme Rousseau sans avoir eu le temps de me reconnaitre; mais ce n'est pas pour cela que je sonne. Croyez-vous pas que je viens de voir comme je vous vois Mme Goupil avec une fillette que je ne connais point. Allez donc chercher deux sous de sel chez Camus. C'est bien rare si Theodore ne peut pas vous dire qui c'est. --Mais ca sera la fille a M. Pupin, disait Francoise qui preferait s'en tenir a une explication immediate, ayant ete deja deux fois depuis le matin chez Camus. --La fille a M. Pupin! Oh! je vous crois bien, ma pauvre Francoise! Avec cela que je ne l'aurais pas reconnue? --Mais je ne veux pas dire la grande, madame Octave, je veux dire la gamine, celle qui est en pension a Jouy. Il me ressemble de l'avoir deja vue ce matin. --Ah! a moins de ca, disait ma tante. Il faudrait qu'elle soit venue pour les fetes. C'est cela! Il n'y a pas besoin de chercher, elle sera venue pour les fetes. Mais alors nous pourrions bien voir tout a l'heure Mme Sazerat venir sonner chez sa sur pour le dejeuner. Ce sera ca! J'ai vu le petit de chez Galopin qui passait avec une tarte! Vous verrez que la tarte allait chez Mme Goupil. --Des l'instant que Mme Goupil a de la visite, madame Octave, vous n'allez pas tarder a voir tout son monde rentrer pour le dejeuner, car il commence a ne plus etre de bonne heure, disait Francoise qui, presse de redescendre s'occuper du dejeuner, n'etait pas fachee de laisser a ma tante cette distraction en perspective. --Oh! pas avant midi, repondait ma tante d'un ton resigne, tout en jetant sur la pendule un coup d'il inquiet, mais furtif pour ne pas laisser voir qu'elle, qui avait renonce a tout, trouvait pourtant, a apprendre que Mme Goupil avait a dejeuner, un plaisir aussi vif, et qui se ferait malheureusement attendre encore un peu plus d'une heure. Et encore cela tombera pendant mon dejeuner! ajouta-t-elle a mi-voix pour elle-meme. Son dejeuner lui etait une distraction suffisante pour qu'elle n'en souhaitat pas une autre en meme temps. Vous n'oublierez pas au moins de me donner mes ufs a la creme dans une assiette plate? C'etaient les seules qui fussent ornees de sujets, et ma tante s'amusait a chaque repas a lire la legende de celle qu'on lui servait ce jour-la.

"merveilleuse, et disait en souriant: Tres bien, tres bien. --Je serais bien allee chez Camus... disait Francoise en voyant que ma tante ne l'y enverrait plus. --Mais non, ce n'est plus la peine, c'est surement Mlle Pupin. Ma pauvre Francoise, je regrette de vous avoir fait monter pour rien. Mais ma tante savait bien que ce n'etait pas pour rien qu'elle avait sonne Francoise, car, a Combray, une personne qu'on ne connaissait point etait un etre aussi peu croyable qu'un dieu de la mythologie, et de fait on ne se souvenait pas que, chaque fois que s'etait produite, dans la rue de Saint-Esprit ou sur la place, une de ces apparitions stupefiantes, des recherches bien conduites n'eussent pas fini par reduire le personnage fabuleux aux proportions d'une personne qu'on connaissait, soit personnellement, soit abstraitement, dans son etat civil, en tant qu'ayant tel degre de parente avec des gens de Combray. C'etait le fils de Mme Sauton qui rentrait du service, la niece de l'abbe Perdreau qui sortait de couvent, le frere du cure, percepteur a Chateaudun qui venait de prendre sa retraite ou qui etait venu passer les fetes. On avait eu en les apercevant l'emotion de croire qu'il y avait a Combray des gens qu'on ne connaissait point simplement parce qu'on ne les avait pas reconnus ou identifies tout de suite. Et pourtant, longtemps a l'avance, Mme Sauton et le cure avaient prevenu qu'ils attendaient leurs voyageurs. Quand le soir, je montais, en rentrant, raconter notre promenade a ma tante, si j'avais l'imprudence de lui dire que nous avions rencontre pres du Pont-Vieux, un homme que mon grand-pere ne connaissait pas: Un homme que grand-pere ne connaissait point, s'ecriait elle. Ah! je te crois bien! Neanmoins un peu emue de cette nouvelle, elle voulait en avoir le cur net, mon grand-pere etait mande. Qui donc est-ce que vous avez rencontre pres du Pont-Vieux, mon oncle? un homme que vous ne connaissiez point? --Mais si, repondait mon grand-pere, c'etait Prosper le frere du jardinier de Mme Bouillebuf. --Ah! bien, disait ma tante, tranquillisee et un peu rouge; haussant les epaules avec un sourire ironique, elle ajoutait: Aussi il me disait que vous aviez rencontre un homme que vous ne connaissiez point! Et on me recommandait d'etre plus circonspect une autre fois et de ne plus agiter ainsi ma tante par des paroles irreflechies. On connaissait tellement bien tout le monde, a Combray, betes et gens, que si ma tante avait vu par hasard passer un chien qu'elle ne connaissait point, elle ne cessait d'y penser et de consacrer a ce fait incomprehensible ses talents d'induction et ses heures de liberte. --Ce sera le chien de Mme Sazerat, disait Francoise, sans grande conviction, mais dans un but d'apaisement et pour que ma tante ne se fende pas la tete. --Comme si je ne connaissais pas le chien de Mme Sazerat! repondait ma tante dont l'esprit critique n'admettait pas si facilement un fait. --Ah! ce sera le nouveau chien que M. Galopin a rapporte de Lisieux. --Ah! a moins de ca. --Il parait que c'est une bete bien affable, ajoutait Francoise qui tenait le renseignement de Theodore, spirituelle comme une personne, toujours de bonne humeur, toujours aimable, toujours quelque chose de gracieux. C'est rare qu'une bete qui n'a que cet age-la soit deja si galante. Madame Octave, il va falloir que je vous quitte, je n'ai pas le temps de m'amuser, voila bientot dix heures, mon fourneau n'est seulement pas eclaire, et j'ai encore a plumer mes asperges. --Comment, Francoise, encore des asperges! mais c'est une vraie maladie d'asperges que vous avez cette annee, vous allez en fatiguer nos Parisiens! --Mais non, madame Octave, ils aiment bien ca. Ils rentreront de l'eglise avec de l'appetit et vous verrez qu'ils ne les mangeront pas avec le dos de la cuiller. --Mais a l'eglise, ils doivent y etre deja; vous ferez bien de ne pas perdre de temps. Allez surveiller votre dejeuner. Pendant que ma tante devisait ainsi avec Francoise, j'accompagnais mes parents a la messe. Que je l'aimais, que je la revois bien, notre Eglise! Son vieux porche par lequel nous entrions, noir, grele comme une ecumoire, etait devie et profondement creuse aux angles (de meme que le benitier ou il nous conduisait) comme si le doux effleurement des mantes des paysannes entrant a l'eglise et de leurs doigts timides prenant de l'eau benite, pouvait, repete pendant des siecles, acquerir une force destructive, inflechir la pierre et l'entailler de sillons comme en trace la roue des carrioles dans la borne contre laquelle elle bute tous les jours. Ses pierres tombales, sous lesquelles la noble poussiere des abbes de Combray, enterres la, faisait au chur comme un pavage spirituel, n'etaient plus elles-memes de la matiere inerte et dure, car le temps les avait rendues douces et fait couler comme du miel hors des limites de leur propre equarrissure qu'ici elles avaient depassees d'un flot blond, entrainant a la derive une majuscule gothique en fleurs, noyant les violettes blanches du marbre; et en deca desquelles, ailleurs, elles s'etaient resorbees, contractant encore l'elliptique inscription latine, introduisant un caprice de plus dans la disposition de ces caracteres abreges, rapprochant deux lettres d'un mot dont les autres avaient ete demesurement distendues. Ses vitraux ne chatoyaient jamais tant que les jours ou le soleil se montrait peu, de sorte que fit-il gris dehors, on etait sur qu'il ferait beau dans l'eglise; l'un etait rempli dans toute sa grandeur par un seul personnage pareil a un Roi de jeu de cartes, qui vivait la-haut, sous un dais architectural, entre ciel et terre; (et dans le reflet oblique et bleu duquel, parfois les jours de semaine, a midi, quand il n'y a pas d'office,--a l'un de ces rares moments ou l'eglise aeree, vacante, plus humaine, luxueuse, avec du soleil sur son riche mobilier, avait l'air presque habitable comme le hall de pierre sculptee et de verre peint, d'un hotel de style moyen age,--on voyait s'agenouiller un instant Mme Sazerat, posant sur le prie-Dieu voisin un paquet tout ficele de petits fours qu'elle venait de prendre chez le patissier d'en face et qu'elle allait rapporter pour le dejeuner); dans un autre une montagne de neige rose, au pied de laquelle se livrait un combat, semblait avoir givre a meme la verriere qu'elle boursouflait de son trouble gresil comme une vitre a laquelle il serait reste des flocons, mais des flocons eclaires par quelque aurore (par la meme sans doute qui empourprait le retable de l'autel de tons si frais qu'ils semblaient plutot poses la momentanement par une lueur du dehors prete a s'evanouir que par des couleurs attachees a jamais a la pierre); et tous etaient si anciens qu'on voyait ca et la leur vieillesse argentee etinceler de la poussiere des siecles et monter brillante et usee jusqu'a la corde la trame de leur douce tapisserie de verre. Il y en avait un qui etait un haut compartiment divise en une centaine de petits vitraux rectangulaires ou dominait le bleu, comme un grand jeu de cartes pareil a ceux qui devaient distraire le roi Charles VI; mais soit qu'un rayon eut brille, soit que mon regard en bougeant eut promene a travers la verriere tour a tour eteinte et rallumee, un mouvant et precieux incendie, l'instant d'apres elle avait pris l'eclat changeant d'une traine de paon, puis elle tremblait et ondulait en une pluie flamboyante et fantastique qui degouttait du haut de la voute sombre et rocheuse, le long des parois humides, comme si c'etait dans la nef de quelque grotte irisee de sinueux stalactites que je suivais mes parents, qui portaient leur paroissien; un instant apres les petits vitraux en losange avaient pris la transparence profonde, l'infrangible durete de saphirs qui eussent ete juxtaposes sur quelque immense pectoral, mais derriere lesquels on sentait, plus aime que toutes ces richesses, un sourire momentane de soleil; il etait aussi reconnaissable dans le flot bleu et doux dont il baignait les pierreries que sur le pave de la place ou la paille du marche; et, meme a nos premiers dimanches quand nous etions arrives avant Paques, il me consolait que la terre fut encore nue et noire, en faisant epanouir, comme en un printemps historique et qui datait des successeurs de saint Louis, ce tapis eblouissant et dore de myosotis en verre. Deux tapisseries de haute lice representaient le couronnement d'Esther (le tradition voulait qu'on eut donne a Assuerus les traits d'un roi de France et a Esther ceux d'une dame de Guermantes dont il etait amoureux) auxquelles leurs couleurs, en fondant, avaient ajoute une expression, un relief, un eclairage: un peu de rose flottait aux levres d'Esther au dela du dessin de leur contour, le jaune de sa robe s'etalait si onctueusement, si grassement, qu'elle en prenait une sorte de consistance et s'enlevait vivement sur l'atmosphere refoulee; et la verdure des arbres restee vive dans les parties basses du panneau de soie et de laine, mais ayant passe dans le haut, faisait se detacher en plus pale, au-dessus des troncs fonces, les hautes branches jaunissantes, dorees et comme a demi effacees par la brusque et oblique illumination d'un soleil invisible. Tout cela et plus encore les objets precieux venus a l'eglise de personnages qui etaient pour moi presque des personnages de legende (la croix d'or travaillee disait-on par saint Eloi et donnee par Dagobert, le tombeau des fils de Louis le Germanique, en porphyre et en cuivre emaille) a cause de quoi je m'avancais dans l'eglise, quand nous gagnions nos chaises, comme dans une vallee visitee des fees, ou le paysan s'emerveille de voir dans un rocher, dans un arbre, dans une mare, la trace palpable de leur passage surnaturel, tout cela faisait d'elle pour moi quelque chose d'entierement different du reste de la ville: un edifice occupant, si l'on peut dire, un espace a quatre dimensions--la quatrieme etant celle du Temps,--deployant a travers les siecles son vaisseau qui, de travee en travee, de",3.813809319660863,1.9861175771474928,0.31901677111493987,0.10987517957116187,4.6717267552182165,4.0,2.661200856275894,29.830188679245282,15.0,34.66537386568071,1.3244781783681214,1.0,0.6713353419599057,1581,696,0.44022770398481975,8323,53,23.992410332604486,26288839503.943253,13778217.769362291,0.5948321816439812,0.6486677065053407,64.50650460062299,11.672616089649491,11.72512409190896,14.968128602627907,15.488927356700437,10.677469955724224,53.04334490947931,6.9245283018867925,True,51.0,0.8810272536687631,4.362159329140461,1908.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023039166583191426,0.013422818791946308,0.013422818791946308,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007212260843433837,0.00801362315937093,0.004207152158669738,0.16719077568134172,13,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"que composaient les tristes rues de Combray. Je n'oublierai jamais, dans une curieuse ville de Normandie voisine de Balbec, deux charmants hotels du XVIIIe siecle, qui me sont a beaucoup d'egards chers et venerables et entre lesquels, quand on la regarde du beau jardin qui descend des perrons vers la riviere, la fleche gothique d'une eglise qu'ils cachent s'elance, ayant l'air de terminer, de surmonter leurs facades, mais d'une matiere si differente, si precieuse, si annelee, si rose, si vernie, qu'on voit bien qu'elle n'en fait pas plus partie que de deux beaux galets unis, entre lesquels elle est prise sur la plage, la fleche purpurine et crenelee de quelque coquillage fusele en tourelle et glace d'email. Meme a Paris, dans un des quartiers les plus laids de la ville, je sais une fenetre ou on voit apres un premier, un second et meme un troisieme plan fait des toits amonceles de plusieurs rues, une cloche violette, parfois rougeatre, parfois aussi, dans les plus nobles epreuves qu'en tire l'atmosphere, d'un noir decante de cendres, laquelle n'est autre que le dome Saint-Augustin et qui donne a cette vue de Paris le caractere de certaines vues de Rome par Piranesi. Mais comme dans aucune de ces petites gravures, avec quelque gout que ma memoire ait pu les executer elle ne put mettre ce que j'avais perdu depuis longtemps, le sentiment qui nous fait non pas considerer une chose comme un spectacle, mais y croire comme en un etre sans equivalent, aucune d'elles ne tient sous sa dependance toute une partie profonde de ma vie, comme fait le souvenir de ces aspects du clocher de Combray dans les rues qui sont derriere l'eglise. Qu'on le vit a cinq heures, quand on allait chercher les lettres a la poste, a quelques maisons de soi, a gauche, surelevant brusquement d'une cime isolee la ligne de faite des toits; que si, au contraire, on voulait entrer demander des nouvelles de Mme Sazerat, on suivit des yeux cette ligne redevenue basse apres la descente de son autre versant en sachant qu'il faudrait tourner a la deuxieme rue apres le clocher; soit qu'encore, poussant plus loin, si on allait a la gare, on le vit obliquement, montrant de profil des aretes et des surfaces nouvelles comme un solide surpris a un moment inconnu de sa revolution; ou que, des bords de la Vivonne, l'abside musculeusement ramassee et remontee par la perspective semblat jaillir de l'effort que le clocher faisait pour lancer sa fleche au cur du ciel: c'etait toujours a lui qu'il fallait revenir, toujours lui qui dominait tout, sommant les maisons d'un pinacle inattendu, leve avant moi comme le doigt de Dieu dont le corps eut ete cache dans la foule des humains sans que je le confondisse pour cela avec elle. Et aujourd'hui encore si, dans une grande ville de province ou dans un quartier de Paris que je connais mal, un passant qui m'a mis dans mon chemin me montre au loin, comme un point de repere, tel beffroi d'hopital, tel clocher de couvent levant la pointe de son bonnet ecclesiastique au coin d'une rue que je dois prendre, pour peu que ma memoire puisse obscurement lui trouver quelque trait de ressemblance avec la figure chere et disparue, le passant, s'il se retourne pour s'assurer que je ne m'egare pas, peut, a son etonnement, m'apercevoir qui, oublieux de la promenade entreprise ou de la course obligee, reste la, devant le clocher, pendant des heures, immobile, essayant de me souvenir, sentant au fond de moi des terres reconquises sur l'oubli qui s'assechent et se rebatissent; et sans doute alors, et plus anxieusement que tout a l'heure quand je lui demandais de me renseigner, je cherche encore mon chemin, je tourne une rue...mais...c'est dans mon cur... En rentrant de la messe, nous rencontrions souvent M. Legrandin qui, retenu a Paris par sa profession d'ingenieur, ne pouvait, en dehors des grandes vacances, venir a sa propriete de Combray que du samedi soir au lundi matin. C'etait un de ces hommes qui, en dehors d'une carriere scientifique ou ils ont d'ailleurs brillamment reussi, possedent une culture toute differente, litteraire, artistique, que leur specialisation professionnelle n'utilise pas et dont profite leur conversation. Plus lettres que bien des litterateurs (nous ne savions pas a cette epoque que M. Legrandin eut une certaine reputation comme ecrivain et nous fumes tres etonnes de voir qu'un musicien celebre avait compose une melodie sur des vers de lui), doues de plus de facilite que bien des peintres, ils s'imaginent que la vie qu'ils menent n'est pas celle qui leur aurait convenu et apportent a leurs occupations positives soit une insouciance melee de fantaisie, soit une application soutenue et hautaine, meprisante, amere et consciencieuse. Grand, avec une belle tournure, un visage pensif et fin aux longues moustaches blondes, au regard bleu et desenchante, d'une politesse raffinee, causeur comme nous n'en avions jamais entendu, il etait aux yeux de ma famille qui le citait toujours en exemple, le type de l'homme d'elite, prenant la vie de la facon la plus noble et la plus delicate. Ma grand'mere lui reprochait seulement de parler un peu trop bien, un peu trop comme un livre, de ne pas avoir dans son langage le naturel qu'il y avait dans ses cravates lavalliere toujours flottantes, dans son veston droit presque d'ecolier. Elle s'etonnait aussi des tirades enflammees qu'il entamait souvent contre l'aristocratie, la vie mondaine, le snobisme, certainement le peche auquel pense saint Paul quand il parle du peche pour lequel il n'y a pas de remission. L'ambition mondaine etait un sentiment que ma grand'mere etait si incapable de ressentir et presque de comprendre qu'il lui paraissait bien inutile de mettre tant d'ardeur a la fletrir. De plus elle ne trouvait pas de tres bon gout que M. Legrandin dont la sur etait mariee pres de Balbec avec un gentilhomme bas-normand se livrat a des attaques aussi violentes encore les nobles, allant jusqu'a reprocher a la Revolution de ne les avoir pas tous guillotines. --Salut, amis! nous disait-il en venant a notre rencontre. Vous etes heureux d'habiter beaucoup ici; demain il faudra que je rentre a Paris, dans ma niche. --Oh! ajoutait-il, avec ce sourire doucement ironique et decu, un peu distrait, qui lui etait particulier, certes il y a dans ma maison toutes les choses inutiles. Il n'y manque que le necessaire, un grand morceau de ciel comme ici. Tachez de garder toujours un morceau de ciel au-dessus de votre vie, petit garcon, ajoutait-il en se tournant vers moi. Vous avez une jolie ame, d'une qualite rare, une nature d'artiste, ne la laissez pas manquer de ce qu'il lui faut. Quand, a notre retour, ma tante nous faisait demander si Mme Goupil etait arrivee en retard a la messe, nous etions incapables de la renseigner. En revanche nous ajoutions a son trouble en lui disant qu'un peintre travaillait dans l'eglise a copier le vitrail de Gilbert le Mauvais. Francoise, envoyee aussitot chez l'epicier, etait revenue bredouille par la faute de l'absence de Theodore a qui sa double profession de chantre ayant une part de l'entretien de l'eglise, et de garcon epicier donnait, avec des relations dans tous les mondes, un savoir universel. --Ah! soupirait ma tante, je voudrais que ce soit deja l'heure d'Eulalie. Il n'y a vraiment qu'elle qui pourra me dire cela. Eulalie etait une fille boiteuse, active et sourde qui s'etait retiree apres la mort de Mme de la Bretonnerie ou elle avait ete en place depuis son enfance et qui avait pris a cote de l'eglise une chambre, d'ou elle descendait tout le temps soit aux offices, soit, en dehors des offices, dire une petite priere ou donner un coup de main a Theodore; le reste du temps elle allait voir des personnes malades comme ma tante Leonie a qui elle racontait ce qui s'etait passe a la messe ou aux vepres. Elle ne dedaignait pas d'ajouter quelque casuel a la petite rente que lui servait la famille de ses anciens maitres en allant de temps en temps visiter le linge du cure ou de quelque autre personnalite marquante du monde clerical de Combray. Elle portait au-dessus d'une mante de drap noir un petit beguin blanc, presque de religieuse, et une maladie de peau donnait a une partie de ses joues et a son nez recourbe, les tons rose vif de la balsamine. Ses visites etaient la grande distraction de ma tante Leonie qui ne recevait plus guere personne d'autre, en dehors de M. le Cure. Ma tante avait peu a peu evince tous les autres visiteurs parce qu'ils avaient le tort a ses yeux de rentrer tous dans l'une ou l'autre des deux categories de gens qu'elle detestait. Les uns, les pires et dont elle s'etait debarrassee les premiers, etaient ceux qui lui conseillaient de ne pas s'ecouter et professaient, fut-ce negativement et en ne la manifestant que par certains silences de desapprobation ou par certains sourires de doute, la doctrine subversive qu'une petite promenade au soleil et un bon bifteck saignant (quand elle gardait quatorze heures sur l'estomac deux mechantes gorgees d'eau de Vichy!) lui feraient plus de bien que son lit et ses medecines. L'autre categorie se composait des personnes qui avaient l'air de croire qu'elle etait plus gravement malade qu'elle ne pensait, etait aussi gravement malade qu'elle le disait. Aussi, ceux qu'elle avait laisse monter apres quelques hesitations et sur les officieuses instances de Francoise et qui, au cours de leur visite, avaient montre combien ils etaient indignes de la faveur qu'on leur faisait en risquant timidement un: Ne croyez-vous pas que si vous vous secouiez un peu par un beau temps, ou qui, au contraire, quand elle leur avait dit: Je suis bien bas, bien bas, c'est la fin, mes pauvres amis, lui avaient repondu: Ah! quand on n'a pas la sante! Mais vous pouvez durer encore comme ca, ceux-la, les uns comme les autres, etaient surs de ne plus jamais etre recus.",4.126708115749048,1.9074158755362296,0.33869507666670096,0.09495955270295581,4.602034329307057,4.0,2.584721293313992,36.58139534883721,25.0,34.065076270409484,1.312778130959949,1.0,0.6497655499559354,1573,672,0.42720915448188174,8175,43,24.66154226804826,51330054129.0349,27216359.559403446,0.7158501297235489,0.7063619319076945,58.64385384171855,14.167526131373915,12.224545103341946,17.404331820399474,18.536279365454845,10.450807374443738,60.67548307928858,8.813953488372093,True,59.0,0.8891834570519618,4.334570519618239,1886.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005083884087442806,0.004473817996949669,0.0,0.13467656415694593,15,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"chapelle en chapelle, semblait vaincre et franchir non pas seulement quelques metres, mais des epoques successives d'ou il sortait victorieux; derobant le rude et farouche XIe siecle dans l'epaisseur de ses murs, d'ou il n'apparaissait avec ses lourds cintres bouches et aveugles de grossiers moellons que par la profonde entaille que creusait pres du porche l'escalier du clocher, et, meme la, dissimule par les gracieuses arcades gothiques qui se pressaient coquettement devant lui comme de plus grandes surs, pour le cacher aux etrangers, se placent en souriant devant un jeune frere rustre, grognon et mal vetu; elevant dans le ciel au-dessus de la Place, sa tour qui avait contemple saint Louis et semblait le voir encore; et s'enfoncant avec sa crypte dans une nuit merovingienne ou, nous guidant a tatons sous la voute obscure et puissamment nervuree comme la membrane d'une immense chauve-souris de pierre, Theodore et sa sur nous eclairaient d'une bougie le tombeau de la petite fille de Sigebert, sur lequel une profonde valve,--comme la trace d'un fossile,--avait ete creusee, disait-on, par une lampe de cristal qui, le soir du meurtre de la princesse franque, s'etait detachee d'elle-meme des chaines d'or ou elle etait suspendue a la place de l'actuelle abside, et, sans que le cristal se brisat, sans que la flamme s'eteignit, s'etait enfoncee dans la pierre et l'avait fait mollement ceder sous elle. L'abside de l'eglise de Combray, peut-on vraiment en parler? Elle etait si grossiere, si denuee de beaute artistique et meme d'elan religieux. Du dehors, comme le croisement des rues sur lequel elle donnait etait en contre-bas, sa grossiere muraille s'exhaussait d'un soubassement en moellons nullement polis, herisses de cailloux, et qui n'avait rien de particulierement ecclesiastique, les verrieres semblaient percees a une hauteur excessive, et le tout avait plus l'air d'un mur de prison que d'eglise. Et certes, plus tard, quand je me rappelais toutes les glorieuses absides que j'ai vues, il ne me serait jamais venu a la pensee de rapprocher d'elles l'abside de Combray. Seulement, un jour, au detour d'une petite rue provinciale, j'apercus, en face du croisement de trois ruelles, une muraille fruste et surelevee, avec des verrieres percees en haut et offrant le meme aspect asymetrique que l'abside de Combray. Alors je ne me suis pas demande comme a Chartres ou a Reims avec quelle puissance y etait exprime le sentiment religieux, mais je me suis involontairement ecrie: L'Eglise! L'eglise! Familiere; mitoyenne, rue Saint-Hilaire, ou etait sa porte nord, de ses deux voisines, la pharmacie de M. Rapin et la maison de Mme Loiseau, qu'elle touchait sans aucune separation; simple citoyenne de Combray qui aurait pu avoir son numero dans la rue si les rues de Combray avaient eu des numeros, et ou il semble que le facteur aurait du s'arreter le matin quand il faisait sa distribution, avant d'entrer chez Mme Loiseau et en sortant de chez M. Rapin, il y avait pourtant entre elle et tout ce qui n'etait pas elle une demarcation que mon esprit n'a jamais pu arriver a franchir. Mme Loiseau avait beau avoir a sa fenetre des fuchsias, qui prenaient la mauvaise habitude de laisser leurs branches courir toujours partout tete baissee, et dont les fleurs n'avaient rien de plus presse, quand elles etaient assez grandes, que d'aller rafraichir leurs joues violettes et congestionnees contre la sombre facade de l'eglise, les fuchsias ne devenaient pas sacres pour cela pour moi; entre les fleurs et la pierre noircie sur laquelle elles s'appuyaient, si mes yeux ne percevaient pas d'intervalle, mon esprit reservait un abime. On reconnaissait le clocher de Saint-Hilaire de bien loin, inscrivant sa figure inoubliable a l'horizon ou Combray n'apparaissait pas encore; quand du train qui, la semaine de Paques, nous amenait de Paris, mon pere l'apercevait qui filait tour a tour sur tous les sillons du ciel, faisant courir en tous sens son petit coq de fer, il nous disait: Allons, prenez les couvertures, on est arrive. Et dans une des plus grandes promenades que nous faisions de Combray, il y avait un endroit ou la route resserree debouchait tout a coup sur un immense plateau ferme a l'horizon par des forets dechiquetees que depassait seul la fine pointe du clocher de Saint-Hilaire, mais si mince, si rose, qu'elle semblait seulement rayee sur le ciel par un ongle qui aurait voulu donner a se paysage, a ce tableau rien que de nature, cette petite marque d'art, cette unique indication humaine. Quand on se rapprochait et qu'on pouvait apercevoir le reste de la tour carree et a demi detruite qui, moins haute, subsistait a cote de lui, on etait frappe surtout de ton rougeatre et sombre des pierres; et, par un matin brumeux d'automne, on aurait dit, s'elevant au-dessus du violet orageux des vignobles, une ruine de pourpre presque de la couleur de la vigne vierge. Souvent sur la place, quand nous rentrions, ma grand'mere me faisait arreter pour le regarder. Des fenetres de sa tour, placees deux par deux les unes au-dessus des autres, avec cette juste et originale proportion dans les distances qui ne donne pas de la beaute et de la dignite qu'aux visages humains, il lachait, laissait tomber a intervalles reguliers des volees de corbeaux qui, pendant un moment, tournoyaient en criant, comme si les vieilles pierres qui les laissaient s'ebattre sans paraitre les voir, devenues tout d'un coup inhabitables et degageant un principe d'agitation infinie, les avait frappes et repousses. Puis, apres avoir raye en tous sens le velours violet de l'air du soir, brusquement calmes ils revenaient s'absorber dans la tour, de nefaste redevenue propice, quelques-uns poses ca et la, ne semblant pas bouger, mais happant peut-etre quelque insecte, sur la pointe d'un clocheton, comme une mouette arretee avec l'immobilite d'un pecheur a la crete d'une vague. Sans trop savoir pourquoi, ma grand'mere trouvait au clocher de Saint-Hilaire cette absence de vulgarite, de pretention, de mesquinerie, qui lui faisait aimer et croire riches d'une influence bienfaisante, la nature, quand la main de l'homme ne l'avait pas, comme faisait le jardinier de ma grand'tante, rapetissee, et les uvres de genie. Et sans doute, toute partie de l'eglise qu'on apercevait la distinguait de tout autre edifice par une sorte de pensee qui lui etait infuse, mais c'etait dans son clocher qu'elle semblait prendre conscience d'elle-meme, affirmer une existence individuelle et responsable. C'etait lui qui parlait pour elle. Je crois surtout que, confusement, ma grand'mere trouvait au clocher de Combray ce qui pour elle avait le plus de prix au monde, l'air naturel et l'air distingue. Ignorante en architecture, elle disait: Mes enfants, moquez-vous de moi si vous voulez, il n'est peut-etre pas beau dans les regles, mais sa vieille figure bizarre me plait. Je suis sure que s'il jouait du piano, il ne jouerait pas sec. Et en le regardant, en suivant des yeux la douce tension, l'inclinaison fervente de ses pentes de pierre qui se rapprochaient en s'elevant comme des mains jointes qui prient, elle s'unissait si bien a l'effusion de la fleche, que son regard semblait s'elancer avec elle; et en meme temps elle souriait amicalement aux vieilles pierres usees dont le couchant n'eclairait plus que le faite et qui, a partir du moment ou elles entraient dans cette zone ensoleillee, adoucies par la lumiere, paraissaient tout d'un coup montees bien plus haut, lointaines, comme un chant repris en voix de tete une octave au-dessus. C'etait le clocher de Saint-Hilaire qui donnait a toutes les occupations, a toutes les heures, a tous les points de vue de la ville, leur figure, leur couronnement, leur consecration. De ma chambre, je ne pouvais apercevoir que sa base qui avait ete recouverte d'ardoises; mais quand, le dimanche, je les voyais, par une chaude matinee d'ete, flamboyer comme un soleil noir, je me disais: Mon-Dieu! neuf heures! il faut se preparer pour aller a la grand'messe si je veux avoir le temps d'aller embrasser tante Leonie avant, et je savais exactement la couleur qu'avait le soleil sur la place, la chaleur et la poussiere du marche, l'ombre que faisait le store du magasin ou maman entrerait peut-etre avant la messe dans une odeur de toile ecrue, faire emplette de quelque mouchoir que lui ferait montrer, en cambrant la taille, le patron qui, tout en se preparant a fermer, venait d'aller dans l'arriere-boutique passer sa veste du dimanche et se savonner les mains qu'il avait l'habitude, toutes les cinq minutes, meme dans les circonstances les plus melancoliques, de frotter l'une contre l'autre d'un air d'entreprise, de partie fine et de reussite. Quand apres la messe, on entrait dire a Theodore d'apporter une brioche plus grosse que d'habitude parce que nos cousins avaient profite du beau temps pour venir de Thiberzy dejeuner avec nous, on avait devant soi le clocher qui, dore et cuit lui-meme comme une plus grande brioche benie, avec des ecailles et des egouttements gommeux de soleil, piquait sa pointe aigue dans le ciel bleu. Et le soir, quand je rentrais de promenade et pensais au moment ou il faudrait tout a l'heure dire bonsoir a ma mere et ne plus la voir, il etait au contraire si doux, dans la journee finissante, qu'il avait l'air d'etre pose et enfonce comme un coussin de velours brun sur le ciel pali qui avait cede sous sa pression, s'etait creuse legerement pour lui faire sa place et refluait sur ses bords; et les cris des oiseaux qui tournaient autour de lui semblaient accroitre son silence, elancer encore sa fleche et lui donner quelque chose d'ineffable. Meme dans les courses qu'on avait a faire derriere l'eglise, la ou on ne la voyait pas, tout semblait ordonne par rapport au clocher surgi ici ou la entre les maisons, peut-etre plus emouvant encore quand il apparaissait ainsi sans l'eglise. Et certes, il y en a bien d'autres qui sont plus beaux vus de cette facon, et j'ai dans mon souvenir des vignettes de clochers depassant les toits, qui ont un autre caractere d'art que celles",4.079885457415142,1.9964763919154802,0.347078264003959,0.10729366057531672,4.652035623409669,4.0,2.607566730341507,46.23529411764706,34.0,43.448454127735836,1.2881679389312977,1.0,0.5981629657782036,1572,663,0.4217557251908397,8413,34,25.367783056794757,104013138183.32,54173509.47047917,0.6680575911745881,0.6631872029975057,50.927168837000494,17.642146385271662,11.946651130624446,20.5551863493489,23.598734845083072,10.913765903307887,70.53554857057327,11.235294117647058,True,50.0,0.8786458333333333,4.381770833333333,1920.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01667824878387769,0.012905787749429166,0.007544922068897051,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004963764519011218,0.006452893874714583,0.0067507197458552565,0.1671875,14,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"Et si Francoise s'amusait de l'air epouvante de ma tante quand de son lit elle avait apercu dans la rue du Saint-Esprit une de ces personnes qui avait l'air de venir chez elle ou quand elle avait entendu un coup de sonnette, elle riait encore bien plus, et comme d'un bon tour, des ruses toujours victorieuses de ma tante pour arriver a les faire congedier et de leur mine deconfite en s'en retournant sans l'avoir vue, et, au fond admirait sa maitresse qu'elle jugeait superieure a tous ces gens puisqu'elle ne voulait pas les recevoir. En somme, ma tante exigeait a la fois qu'on l'approuvat dans son regime, qu'on la plaignit pour ses souffrances et qu'on la rassurat sur son avenir. C'est a quoi Eulalie excellait. Ma tante pouvait lui dire vingt fois en une minute: C'est la fin, ma pauvre Eulalie, vingt fois Eulalie repondait: Connaissant votre maladie comme vous la connaissez, madame Octave, vous irez a cent ans, comme me disait hier encore Mme Sazerin. (Une des plus fermes croyances d'Eulalie et que le nombre imposant des dementis apportes par l'experience n'avait pas suffi a entamer, etait que Mme Sazerat s'appelait Mme Sazerin.) --Je ne demande pas a aller a cent ans, repondait ma tante qui preferait ne pas voir assigner a ses jours un terme precis. Et comme Eulalie savait avec cela comme personne distraire ma tante sans la fatiguer, ses visites qui avaient lieu regulierement tous les dimanches sauf empechement inopine, etaient pour ma tante un plaisir dont la perspective l'entretenait ces jours-la dans un etat agreable d'abord, mais bien vite douloureux comme une faim excessive, pour peu qu'Eulalie fut en retard. Trop prolongee, cette volupte d'attendre Eulalie tournait en supplice, ma tante ne cessait de regarder l'heure, baillait, se sentait des faiblesses. Le coup de sonnette d'Eulalie, s'il arrivait tout a la fin de la journee, quand elle ne l'esperait plus, la faisait presque se trouver mal. En realite, le dimanche, elle ne pensait qu'a cette visite et sitot le dejeuner fini, Francoise avait hate que nous quittions la salle a manger pour qu'elle put monter occuper ma tante. Mais (surtout a partir du moment ou les beaux jours s'installaient a Combray) il y avait bien longtemps que l'heure altiere de midi, descendue de la tour de Saint-Hilaire qu'elle armoriait des douze fleurons momentanes de sa couronne sonore avait retenti autour de notre table, aupres du pain benit venu lui aussi familierement en sortant de l'eglise, quand nous etions encore assis devant les assiettes des Mille et une Nuits, appesantis par la chaleur et surtout par le repas. Car, au fond permanent d'ufs, de cotelettes, de pommes de terre, de confitures, de biscuits, qu'elle ne nous annoncait meme plus, Francoise ajoutait--selon les travaux des champs et des vergers, le fruit de la maree, les hasards du commerce, les politesses des voisins et son propre genie, et si bien que notre menu, comme ces quatre-feuilles qu'on sculptait au XIIIe siecle au portail des cathedrales, refletait un peu le rythme des saisons et les episodes de la vie--: une barbue parce que la marchande lui en avait garanti la fraicheur, une dinde parce qu'elle en avait vu une belle au marche de Roussainville-le-Pin, des cardons a la moelle parce qu'elle ne nous en avait pas encore fait de cette maniere-la, un gigot roti parce que le grand air creuse et qu'il avait bien le temps de descendre d'ici sept heures, des epinards pour changer, des abricots parce que c'etait encore une rarete, des groseilles parce que dans quinze jours il n'y en aurait plus, des framboises que M. Swann avait apportees expres, des cerises, les premieres qui vinssent du cerisier du jardin apres deux ans qu'il n'en donnait plus, du fromage a la creme que j'aimais bien autrefois, un gateau aux amandes parce qu'elle l'avait commande la veille, une brioche parce que c'etait notre tour de l'offrir. Quand tout cela etait fini, composee expressement pour nous, mais dediee plus specialement a mon pere qui etait amateur, une creme au chocolat, inspiration, attention personnelle de Francoise, nous etait offerte, fugitive et legere comme une uvre de circonstance ou elle avait mis tout son talent. Celui qui eut refuse d'en gouter en disant: J'ai fini, je n'ai plus faim, se serait immediatement ravale au rang de ces goujats qui, meme dans le present qu'un artiste leur fait d'une de ses uvres, regardent au poids et a la matiere alors que n'y valent que l'intention et la signature. Meme en laisser une seule goutte dans le plat eut temoigne de la meme impolitesse que se lever avant la fin du morceau au nez du compositeur. Enfin ma mere me disait: Voyons, ne reste pas ici indefiniment, monte dans ta chambre si tu as trop chaud dehors, mais va d'abord prendre l'air un instant pour ne pas lier en sortant de table. J'allais m'asseoir pres de la pompe et de son auge, souvent ornee, comme un fond gothique, d'une salamandre, qui sculptait sur la pierre fruste le relief mobile de son corps allegorique et fusele, sur le banc sans dossier ombrage d'un lilas, dans ce petit coin du jardin qui s'ouvrait par une porte de service sur la rue du Saint-Esprit et de la terre peu soignee duquel s'elevait par deux degres, en saillie de la maison, et comme une construction independante, l'arriere-cuisine. On apercevait son dallage rouge et luisant comme du porphyre. Elle avait moins l'air de l'antre de Francoise que d'un petit temple a Venus. Elle regorgeait des offrandes du cremier, du fruitier, de la marchande de legumes, venus parfois de hameaux assez lointains pour lui dedier les premices de leurs champs. Et son faite etait toujours couronne du roucoulement d'une colombe. Autrefois, je ne m'attardais pas dans le bois consacre qui l'entourait, car, avant de monter lire, j'entrais dans le petit cabinet de repos que mon oncle Adolphe, un frere de mon grand-pere, ancien militaire qui avait pris sa retraite comme commandant, occupait au rez-de-chaussee, et qui, meme quand les fenetres ouvertes laissaient entrer la chaleur, sinon les rayons du soleil qui atteignaient rarement jusque-la, degageait inepuisablement cette odeur obscure et fraiche, a la fois forestiere et ancien regime, qui fait rever longuement les narines, quand on penetre dans certains pavillons de chasse abandonnes. Mais depuis nombre d'annees je n'entrais plus dans le cabinet de mon oncle Adolphe, ce dernier ne venant plus a Combray a cause d'une brouille qui etait survenue entre lui et ma famille, par ma faute, dans les circonstances suivantes: Une ou deux fois par mois, a Paris, on m'envoyait lui faire une visite, comme il finissait de dejeuner, en simple vareuse, servi par son domestique en veste de travail de coutil raye violet et blanc. Il se plaignait en ronchonnant que je n'etais pas venu depuis longtemps, qu'on l'abandonnait; il m'offrait un massepain ou une mandarine, nous traversions un salon dans lequel on ne s'arretait jamais, ou on ne faisait jamais de feu, dont les murs etaient ornes de moulures dorees, les plafonds peints d'un bleu qui pretendait imiter le ciel et les meubles capitonnes en satin comme chez mes grands-parents, mais jaune; puis nous passions dans ce qu'il appelait son cabinet de travail aux murs duquel etaient accrochees de ces gravures representant sur fond noir une deesse charnue et rose conduisant un char, montee sur un globe, ou une etoile au front, qu'on aimait sous le second Empire parce qu'on leur trouvait un air pompeien, puis qu'on detesta, et qu'on recommence a aimer pour une seule et meme raison, malgre les autres qu'on donne et qui est qu'elles ont l'air second Empire. Et je restais avec mon oncle jusqu'a ce que son valet de chambre vint lui demander, de la part du cocher, pour quelle heure celui-ci devait atteler. Mon oncle se plongeait alors dans une meditation qu'aurait craint de troubler d'un seul mouvement son valet de chambre emerveille, et dont il attendait avec curiosite le resultat, toujours identique. Enfin, apres une hesitation supreme, mon oncle prononcait infailliblement ces mots: Deux heures et quart, que le valet de chambre repetait avec etonnement, mais sans discuter: Deux heures et quart? bien...je vais le dire... A cette epoque j'avais l'amour du theatre, amour platonique, car mes parents ne m'avaient encore jamais permis d'y aller, et je me representais d'une facon si peu exacte les plaisirs qu'on y goutait que je n'etais pas eloigne de croire que chaque spectateur regardait comme dans un stereoscope un decor qui n'etait que pour lui, quoique semblable au millier d'autres que regardait, chacun pour soi, le reste des spectateurs. Tous les matins je courais jusqu'a la colonne Moriss pour voir les spectacles qu'elle annoncait. Rien n'etait plus desinteresse et plus heureux que les reves offerts a mon imagination par chaque piece annoncee et qui etaient conditionnes a la fois par les images inseparables des mots qui en composaient le titre et aussi de la couleur des affiches encore humides et boursouflees de colle sur lesquelles il se detachait. Si ce n'est une de ces uvres etranges comme le Testament de Cesar Girodot et dipe-Roi lesquelles s'inscrivaient, non sur l'affiche verte de l'Opera-Comique, mais sur l'affiche lie de vin de la Comedie-Francaise, rien ne me paraissait plus different de l'aigrette etincelante et blanche des Diamants de la Couronne que le satin lisse et mysterieux du Domino Noir, et, mes parents m'ayant dit que quand j'irais pour la premiere fois au theatre j'aurais a choisir entre ces deux pieces, cherchant a approfondir successivement le titre de l'une et le titre de l'autre, puisque c'etait tout ce que je connaissais d'elles, pour tacher de saisir en chacun le plaisir qu'il me promettait et de le comparer a celui que recelait l'autre, j'arrivais a me representer avec tant de force, d'une part une piece eblouissante et fiere, de l'autre une piece douce et veloutee, que j'etais aussi incapable de decider laquelle aurait ma preference, que si, pour le dessert, on m'avait donne a opter",4.120819560219606,2.168698183603956,0.32804175733626456,0.13502275619988832,4.649358974358974,4.0,2.5863546466633105,35.45454545454545,24.5,38.442078357312475,1.3153846153846154,1.0,0.6226652644544943,1560,684,0.43846153846153846,8334,44,23.749924259393083,20628186607.053234,10885586.600028092,0.6741302313153134,0.6741734954218069,59.56709790209793,13.75881118881119,11.784343379278567,16.771561771561775,18.195753496503492,10.70335897435897,58.65967365967366,8.227272727272727,True,52.0,0.8886543535620053,4.397889182058048,1895.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008805283169901942,0.004402641584950971,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0065039023414048425,0.0027016209725835502,0.0,0.16411609498680738,16,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"y enchassant un de ses regards d'une si belle eau, nuance d'humilite et de gratitude, elle le rendait change en un bijou artiste, en quelque chose de tout a fait exquis. --Allons, voyons, il est l'heure que tu t'en ailles, me dit mon oncle. Je me levai, j'avais une envie irresistible de baiser la main de la dame en rose, mais il me semblait que c'eut ete quelque chose d'audacieux comme un enlevement. Mon cur battait tandis que je me disais: Faut-il le faire, faut-il ne pas le faire, puis je cessai de me demander ce qu'il fallait faire pour pouvoir faire quelque chose. Et d'un geste aveugle et insense, depouille de toutes les raisons que je trouvais il y avait un moment en sa faveur, je portai a mes levres la main qu'elle me tendait. --Comme il est gentil! il est deja galant, il a un petit il pour les femmes: il tient de son oncle. Ce sera un parfait gentleman, ajouta-t-elle en serrant les dents pour donner a la phrase un accent legerement britannique. Est-ce qu'il ne pourrait pas venir une fois prendre a cup of tea, comme disent nos voisins les Anglais; il n'aurait qu'a m'envoyer un bleu le matin. Je ne savais pas ce que c'etait qu'un bleu. Je ne comprenais pas la moitie des mots que disait la dame, mais la crainte que n'y fut cachee quelque question a laquelle il eut ete impoli de ne pas repondre, m'empechait de cesser de les ecouter avec attention, et j'en eprouvais une grande fatigue. --Mais non, c'est impossible, dit mon oncle, en haussant les epaules, il est tres tenu, il travaille beaucoup. Il a tous les prix a son cours, ajouta-t-il, a voix basse pour que je n'entende pas ce mensonge et que je n'y contredise pas. Qui sait, ce sera peut-etre un petit Victor Hugo, une espece de Vaulabelle, vous savez. --J'adore les artistes, repondit la dame en rose, il n'y a qu'eux qui comprennent les femmes... Qu'eux et les etres d'elite comme vous. Excusez mon ignorance, ami. Qui est Vaulabelle? Est-ce les volumes dores qu'il y a dans la petite bibliotheque vitree de votre boudoir? Vous savez que vous m'avez promis de me les preter, j'en aurai grand soin. Mon oncle qui detestait preter ses livres ne repondit rien et me conduisit jusqu'a l'antichambre. Eperdu d'amour pour la dame en rose, je couvris de baisers fous les joues pleines de tabac de mon vieil oncle, et tandis qu'avec assez d'embarras il me laissait entendre sans oser me le dire ouvertement qu'il aimerait autant que je ne parlasse pas de cette visite a mes parents, je lui disais, les larmes aux yeux, que le souvenir de sa bonte etait en moi si fort que je trouverais bien un jour le moyen de lui temoigner ma reconnaissance. Il etait si fort en effet que deux heures plus tard, apres quelques phrases mysterieuses et qui ne me parurent pas donner a mes parents une idee assez nette de la nouvelle importance dont j'etais doue, je trouvai plus explicite de leur raconter dans les moindres details la visite que je venais de faire. Je ne croyais pas ainsi causer d'ennuis a mon oncle. Comment l'aurais-je cru, puisque je ne le desirais pas. Et je ne pouvais supposer que mes parents trouveraient du mal dans une visite ou je n'en trouvais pas. N'arrive-t-il pas tous les jours qu'un ami nous demande de ne pas manquer de l'excuser aupres d'une femme a qui il a ete empeche d'ecrire, et que nous negligions de le faire jugeant que cette personne ne peut pas attacher d'importance a un silence qui n'en a pas pour nous? Je m'imaginais, comme tout le monde, que le cerveau des autres etait un receptacle inerte et docile, sans pouvoir de reaction specifique sur ce qu'on y introduisait; et je ne doutais pas qu'en deposant dans celui de mes parents la nouvelle de la connaissance que mon oncle m'avait fait faire, je ne leur transmisse en meme temps comme je le souhaitais, le jugement bienveillant que je portais sur cette presentation. Mes parents malheureusement s'en remirent a des principes entierement differents de ceux que je leur suggerais d'adopter, quand ils voulurent apprecier l'action de mon oncle. Mon pere et mon grand-pere eurent avec lui des explications violentes; j'en fus indirectement informe. Quelques jours apres, croisant dehors mon oncle qui passait en voiture decouverte, je ressentis la douleur, la reconnaissance, le remords que j'aurais voulu lui exprimer. A cote de leur immensite, je trouvai qu'un coup de chapeau serait mesquin et pourrait faire supposer a mon oncle que je ne me croyais pas tenu envers lui a plus qu'a une banale politesse. Je resolus de m'abstenir de ce geste insuffisant et je detournai la tete. Mon oncle pensa que je suivais en cela les ordres de mes parents, il ne le leur pardonna pas, et il est mort bien des annees apres sans qu'aucun de nous l'ait jamais revu. Aussi je n'entrais plus dans le cabinet de repos maintenant ferme, de mon oncle Adolphe, et apres m'etre attarde aux abords de l'arriere-cuisine, quand Francoise, apparaissant sur le parvis, me disait: Je vais laisser ma fille de cuisine servir le cafe et monter l'eau chaude, il faut que je me sauve chez Mme Octave, je me decidais a rentrer et montais directement lire chez moi. La fille de cuisine etait une personne morale, une institution permanente a qui des attributions invariables assuraient une sorte de continuite et d'identite, a travers la succession des formes passageres en lesquelles elle s'incarnait: car nous n'eumes jamais la meme deux ans de suite. L'annee ou nous mangeames tant d'asperges, la fille de cuisine habituellement chargee de les plumer etait une pauvre creature maladive, dans un etat de grossesse deja assez avance quand nous arrivames a Paques, et on s'etonnait meme que Francoise lui laissat faire tant de courses et de besogne, car elle commencait a porter difficilement devant elle la mysterieuse corbeille, chaque jour plus remplie, dont on devinait sous ses amples sarraus la forme magnifique. Ceux-ci rappelaient les houppelandes qui revetent certaines des figures symboliques de Giotto dont M. Swann m'avait donne des photographies. C'est lui-meme qui nous l'avait fait remarquer et quand il nous demandait des nouvelles de la fille de cuisine, il nous disait: Comment va la Charite de Giotto? D'ailleurs elle-meme, la pauvre fille, engraissee par sa grossesse, jusqu'a la figure, jusqu'aux joues qui tombaient droites et carrees, ressemblait en effet assez a ces vierges, fortes et hommasses, matrones plutot, dans lesquelles les vertus sont personnifiees a l'Arena. Et je me rends compte maintenant que ces Vertus et ces Vices de Padoue lui ressemblaient encore d'une autre maniere. De meme que l'image de cette fille etait accrue par le symbole ajoute qu'elle portait devant son ventre, sans avoir l'air d'en comprendre le sens, sans que rien dans son visage en traduisit la beaute et l'esprit, comme un simple et pesant fardeau, de meme c'est sans paraitre s'en douter que la puissante menagere qui est representee a l'Arena au-dessous du nom Caritas et dont la reproduction etait accrochee au mur de ma salle d'etudes, a Combray, incarne cette vertu, c'est sans qu'aucune pensee de charite semble avoir jamais pu etre exprimee par son visage energique et vulgaire. Par une belle invention du peintre elle foule aux pieds les tresors de la terre, mais absolument comme si elle pietinait des raisins pour en extraire le jus ou plutot comme elle aurait monte sur des sacs pour se hausser; et elle tend a Dieu son cur enflamme, disons mieux, elle le lui passe, comme une cuisiniere passe un tire-bouchon par le soupirail de son sous-sol a quelqu'un qui le lui demande a la fenetre du rez-de-chaussee. L'Envie, elle, aurait eu davantage une certaine expression d'envie. Mais dans cette fresque-la encore, le symbole tient tant de place et est represente comme si reel, le serpent qui siffle aux levres de l'Envie est si gros, il lui remplit si completement sa bouche grande ouverte, que les muscles de sa figure sont distendus pour pouvoir le contenir, comme ceux d'un enfant qui gonfle un ballon avec son souffle, et que l'attention de l'Envie--et la notre du meme coup--tout entiere concentree sur l'action de ses levres, n'a guere de temps a donner a d'envieuses pensees. Malgre toute l'admiration que M. Swann professait pour ces figures de Giotto, je n'eus longtemps aucun plaisir a considerer dans notre salle d'etudes, ou on avait accroche les copies qu'il m'en avait rapportees, cette Charite sans charite, cette Envie qui avait l'air d'une planche illustrant seulement dans un livre de medecine la compression de la glotte ou de la luette par une tumeur de la langue ou par l'introduction de l'instrument de l'operateur, une Justice, dont le visage grisatre et mesquinement regulier etait celui-la meme qui, a Combray, caracterisait certaines jolies bourgeoises pieuses et seches que je voyais a la messe et dont plusieurs etaient enrolees d'avance dans les milices de reserve de l'Injustice. Mais plus tard j'ai compris que l'etrangete saisissante, la beaute speciale de ces fresques tenait a la grande place que le symbole y occupait, et que le fait qu'il fut represente non comme un symbole puisque la pensee symbolisee n'etait pas exprimee, mais comme reel, comme effectivement subi ou materiellement manie, donnait a la signification de l'uvre quelque chose de plus litteral et de plus precis, a son enseignement quelque chose de plus concret et de plus frappant. Chez la pauvre fille de cuisine, elle aussi, l'attention n'etait-elle pas sans cesse ramenee a son ventre par le poids qui le tirait; et de meme encore, bien souvent la pensee des agonisants est tournee vers le cote effectif, douloureux, obscur, visceral, vers cet envers de la mort qui est precisement le cote qu'elle leur presente, qu'elle leur fait rudement sentir et qui ressemble beaucoup plus a un fardeau qui les ecrase, a une difficulte de respirer, a un besoin de boire,",3.902519848695992,1.572999281916301,0.33163581501855854,0.08642335184335857,4.505403687221869,4.0,2.6349410278753025,29.12962962962963,23.0,22.652811366931672,1.301970756516211,1.0,0.647536232730291,1573,630,0.4005085823267641,8151,54,24.518249747102693,44477520763.41344,23396907.292695127,0.7342005996209271,0.733896849820247,67.12169992465448,11.133810482446851,10.74609503303851,14.093047020319748,14.355266181629815,9.675626191989824,51.189388053024416,6.425925925925926,True,72.0,0.891109942135718,4.2877432930036825,1901.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007134848639282438,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007950259912343289,0.0081541127306085,0.004586688410967281,0.15886375591793792,18,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"encore du riz a l'Imperatrice et de la creme au chocolat. Toutes mes conversations avec mes camarades portaient sur ces acteurs dont l'art, bien qu'il me fut encore inconnu, etait la premiere forme, entre toutes celles qu'il revet, sous laquelle se laissait pressentir par moi, l'Art. Entre la maniere que l'un ou l'autre avait de debiter, de nuancer une tirade, les differences les plus minimes me semblaient avoir une importance incalculable. Et, d'apres ce que l'on m'avait dit d'eux, je les classais par ordre de talent, dans des listes que je me recitais toute la journee: et qui avaient fini par durcir dans mon cerveau et par le gener de leur inamovibilite. Plus tard, quand je fus au college, chaque fois que pendant les classes, je correspondais, aussitot que le professeur avait la tete tournee, avec un nouvel ami, ma premiere question etait toujours pour lui demander s'il etait deja alle au theatre et s'il trouvait que le plus grand acteur etait bien Got, le second Delaunay, etc. Et si, a son avis, Febvre ne venait qu'apres Thiron, ou Delaunay qu'apres Coquelin, la soudaine motilite que Coquelin, perdant la rigidite de la pierre, contractait dans mon esprit pour y passer au deuxieme rang, et l'agilite miraculeuse, la feconde animation dont se voyait doue Delaunay pour reculer au quatrieme, rendait la sensation du fleurissement et de la vie a mon cerveau assoupli et fertilise. Mais si les acteurs me preoccupaient ainsi, si la vue de Maubant sortant un apres-midi du Theatre-Francais m'avait cause le saisissement et les souffrances de l'amour, combien le nom d'une etoile flamboyant a la porte d'un theatre, combien, a la glace d'un coupe qui passait dans la rue avec ses chevaux fleuris de roses au frontail, la vue du visage d'une femme que je pensais etre peut-etre une actrice, laissait en moi un trouble plus prolonge, un effort impuissant et douloureux pour me representer sa vie! Je classais par ordre de talent les plus illustres: Sarah Bernhardt, la Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary, mais toutes m'interessaient. Or mon oncle en connaissait beaucoup, et aussi des cocottes que je ne distinguais pas nettement des actrices. Il les recevait chez lui. Et si nous n'allions le voir qu'a certains jours c'est que, les autres jours, venaient des femmes avec lesquelles sa famille n'aurait pas pu se rencontrer, du moins a son avis a elle, car, pour mon oncle, au contraire, sa trop grande facilite a faire a de jolies veuves qui n'avaient peut-etre jamais ete mariees, a des comtesses de nom ronflant, qui n'etait sans doute qu'un nom de guerre, la politesse de les presenter a ma grand'mere ou meme a leur donner des bijoux de famille, l'avait deja brouille plus d'une fois avec mon grand-pere. Souvent, a un nom d'actrice qui venait dans la conversation, j'entendais mon pere dire a ma mere, en souriant: Une amie de ton oncle; et je pensais que le stage que peut-etre pendant des annees des hommes importants faisaient inutilement a la porte de telle femme qui ne repondait pas a leurs lettres et les faisait chasser par le concierge de son hotel, mon oncle aurait pu en dispenser un gamin comme moi en le presentant chez lui a l'actrice, inapprochable a tant d'autres, qui etait pour lui une intime amie. Aussi,--sous le pretexte qu'une lecon qui avait ete deplacee tombait maintenant si mal qu'elle m'avait empeche plusieurs fois et m'empecherait encore de voir mon oncle--un jour, autre que celui qui etait reserve aux visites que nous lui faisions, profitant de ce que mes parents avaient dejeune de bonne heure, je sortis et au lieu d'aller regarder la colonne d'affiches, pour quoi on me laissait aller seul, je courus jusqu'a lui. Je remarquai devant sa porte une voiture attelee de deux chevaux qui avaient aux illeres un illet rouge comme avait le cocher a sa boutonniere. De l'escalier j'entendis un rire et une voix de femme, et des que j'eus sonne, un silence, puis le bruit de portes qu'on fermait. Le valet de chambre vint ouvrir, et en me voyant parut embarrasse, me dit que mon oncle etait tres occupe, ne pourrait sans doute pas me recevoir et tandis qu'il allait pourtant le prevenir la meme voix que j'avais entendue disait: Oh, si! laisse-le entrer; rien qu'une minute, cela m'amuserait tant. Sur la photographie qui est sur ton bureau, il ressemble tant a sa maman, ta niece, dont la photographie est a cote de la sienne, n'est-ce pas? Je voudrais le voir rien qu'un instant, ce gosse. J'entendis mon oncle grommeler, se facher; finalement le valet de chambre me fit entrer. Sur la table, il y avait la meme assiette de massepains que d'habitude; mon oncle avait sa vareuse de tous les jours, mais en face de lui, en robe de soie rose avec un grand collier de perles au cou, etait assise une jeune femme qui achevait de manger une mandarine. L'incertitude ou j'etais s'il fallait dire madame ou mademoiselle me fit rougir et n'osant pas trop tourner les yeux de son cote de peur d'avoir a lui parler, j'allai embrasser mon oncle. Elle me regardait en souriant, mon oncle lui dit: Mon neveu, sans lui dire mon nom, ni me dire le sien, sans doute parce que, depuis les difficultes qu'il avait eues avec mon grand-pere, il tachait autant que possible d'eviter tout trait d'union entre sa famille et ce genre de relations. --Comme il ressemble a sa mere, dit-elle. --Mais vous n'avez jamais vu ma niece qu'en photographie, dit vivement mon oncle d'un ton bourru. --Je vous demande pardon, mon cher ami, je l'ai croisee dans l'escalier l'annee derniere quand vous avez ete si malade. Il est vrai que je ne l'ai vue que le temps d'un eclair et que votre escalier est bien noir, mais cela m'a suffi pour l'admirer. Ce petit jeune homme a ses beaux yeux et aussi ca, dit-elle, en tracant avec son doigt une ligne sur le bas de son front. Est-ce que madame votre niece porte le meme nom que vous, ami? demanda-t-elle a mon oncle. --Il ressemble surtout a son pere, grogna mon oncle qui ne se souciait pas plus de faire des presentations a distance en disant le nom de maman que d'en faire de pres. C'est tout a fait son pere et aussi ma pauvre mere. --Je ne connais pas son pere, dit la dame en rose avec une legere inclinaison de la tete, et je n'ai jamais connu votre pauvre mere, mon ami. Vous vous souvenez, c'est peu apres votre grand chagrin que nous nous sommes connus. J'eprouvais une petite deception, car cette jeune dame ne differait pas des autres jolies femmes que j'avais vues quelquefois dans ma famille notamment de la fille d'un de nos cousins chez lequel j'allais tous les ans le premier janvier. Mieux habillee seulement, l'amie de mon oncle avait le meme regard vif et bon, elle avait l'air aussi franc et aimant. Je ne lui trouvais rien de l'aspect theatral que j'admirais dans les photographies d'actrices, ni de l'expression diabolique qui eut ete en rapport avec la vie qu'elle devait mener. J'avais peine a croire que ce fut une cocotte et surtout je n'aurais pas cru que ce fut une cocotte chic si je n'avais pas vu la voiture a deux chevaux, la robe rose, le collier de perles, si je n'avais pas su que mon oncle n'en connaissait que de la plus haute volee. Mais je me demandais comment le millionnaire qui lui donnait sa voiture et son hotel et ses bijoux pouvait avoir du plaisir a manger sa fortune pour une personne qui avait l'air si simple et comme il faut. Et pourtant en pensant a ce que devait etre sa vie, l'immoralite m'en troublait peut-etre plus que si elle avait ete concretisee devant moi en une apparence speciale,--d'etre ainsi invisible comme le secret de quelque roman, de quelque scandale qui avait fait sortir de chez ses parents bourgeois et voue a tout le monde, qui avait fait epanouir en beaute et hausse jusqu'au demi-monde et a la notoriete celle que ses jeux de physionomie, ses intonations de voix, pareils a tant d'autres que je connaissais deja, me faisaient malgre moi considerer comme une jeune fille de bonne famille, qui n'etait plus d'aucune famille. On etait passe dans le cabinet de travail, et mon oncle, d'un air un peu gene par ma presence, lui offrit des cigarettes. --Non, dit-elle, cher, vous savez que je suis habituee a celles que le grand-duc m'envoie. Je lui ai dit que vous en etiez jaloux. Et elle tira d'un etui des cigarettes couvertes d'inscriptions etrangeres et dorees. Mais si, reprit-elle tout d'un coup, je dois avoir rencontre chez vous le pere de ce jeune homme. N'est-ce pas votre neveu? Comment ai-je pu l'oublier? Il a ete tellement bon, tellement exquis pour moi, dit-elle d'un air modeste et sensible. Mais en pensant a ce qu'avait pu etre l'accueil rude qu'elle disait avoir trouve exquis, de mon pere, moi qui connaissais sa reserve et sa froideur, j'etais gene, comme par une indelicatesse qu'il aurait commise, de cette inegalite entre la reconnaissance excessive qui lui etait accordee et son amabilite insuffisante. Il m'a semble plus tard que c'etait un des cotes touchants du role de ces femmes oisives et studieuses qu'elles consacrent leur generosite, leur talent, un reve disponible de beaute sentimentale--car, comme les artistes, elles ne le realisent pas, ne le font pas entrer dans les cadres de l'existence commune,--et un or qui leur coute peu, a enrichir d'un sertissage precieux et fin la vie fruste et mal degrossie des hommes. Comme celle-ci, dans le fumoir ou mon oncle etait en vareuse pour la recevoir, repandait son corps si doux, sa robe de soie rose, ses perles, l'elegance qui emane de l'amitie d'un grand-duc, de meme elle avait pris quelque propos insignifiant de mon pere, elle l'avait travaille avec delicatesse, lui avait donne un tour, une appellation precieuse et",3.8885299681517598,1.6479288194894648,0.3159853989657456,0.10301264275722975,4.393610223642172,4.0,2.4846539993803347,26.52542372881356,18.0,24.49168377170088,1.2792332268370608,1.0,0.6248195035839682,1565,600,0.38338658146964855,7985,59,26.528987354976895,332194791427.63135,173108281.0982967,0.7092638755666798,0.689062642685154,71.68856392483893,9.84986733091461,10.262767181585296,12.961607191205935,12.526616017761413,8.91851757188498,45.82254832945254,5.11864406779661,True,63.0,0.8806670140698281,4.161021365294424,1919.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01658890616899948,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014930015552099534,0.0037325038880248835,0.00414722654224987,0.1255862428348098,17,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"qu'a ce que nous appelons l'idee de la mort. Il fallait que ces Vertus et ces Vices de Padoue eussent en eux bien de la realite puisqu'ils m'apparaissaient comme aussi vivants que la servante enceinte, et qu'elle-meme ne me semblait pas beaucoup moins allegorique. Et peut-etre cette non-participation (du moins apparente) de l'ame d'un etre a la vertu qui agit par lui, a aussi en dehors de sa valeur esthetique une realite sinon psychologique, au moins, comme on dit, physiognomonique. Quand, plus tard, j'ai eu l'occasion de rencontrer, au cours de ma vie, dans des couvents par exemple, des incarnations vraiment saintes de la charite active, elles avaient generalement un air allegre, positif, indifferent et brusque de chirurgien presse, ce visage ou ne se lit aucune commiseration, aucun attendrissement devant la souffrance humaine, aucune crainte de la heurter, et qui est le visage sans douceur, le visage antipathique et sublime de la vraie bonte. Pendant que la fille de cuisine,--faisant briller involontairement la superiorite de Francoise, comme l'Erreur, par le contraste, rend plus eclatant le triomphe de la Verite--servait du cafe qui, selon maman n'etait que de l'eau chaude, et montait ensuite dans nos chambres de l'eau chaude qui etait a peine tiede, je m'etais etendu sur mon lit, un livre a la main, dans ma chambre qui protegeait en tremblant sa fraicheur transparente et fragile contre le soleil de l'apres-midi derriere ses volets presque clos ou un reflet de jour avait pourtant trouve moyen de faire passer ses ailes jaunes, et restait immobile entre le bois et le vitrage, dans un coin, comme un papillon pose. Il faisait a peine assez clair pour lire, et la sensation de la splendeur de la lumiere ne m'etait donnee que par les coups frappes dans la rue de la Cure par Camus (averti par Francoise que ma tante ne reposait pas et qu'on pouvait faire du bruit) contre des caisses poussiereuses, mais qui, retentissant dans l'atmosphere sonore, speciale aux temps chauds, semblaient faire voler au loin des astres ecarlates; et aussi par les mouches qui executaient devant moi, dans leur petit concert, comme la musique de chambre de l'ete: elle ne l'evoque pas a la facon d'un air de musique humaine, qui, entendu par hasard a la belle saison, vous la rappelle ensuite; elle est unie a l'ete par un lien plus necessaire: nee des beaux jours, ne renaissant qu'avec eux, contenant un peu de leur essence, elle n'en reveille pas seulement l'image dans notre memoire, elle en certifie le retour, la presence effective, ambiante, immediatement accessible. Cette obscure fraicheur de ma chambre etait au plein soleil de la rue, ce que l'ombre est au rayon, c'est-a-dire aussi lumineuse que lui, et offrait a mon imagination le spectacle total de l'ete dont mes sens si j'avais ete en promenade, n'auraient pu jouir que par morceaux; et ainsi elle s'accordait bien a mon repos qui (grace aux aventures racontees par mes livres et qui venaient l'emouvoir) supportait pareil au repos d'une main immobile au milieu d'une eau courante, le choc et l'animation d'un torrent d'activite. Mais ma grand'mere, meme si le temps trop chaud s'etait gate, si un orage ou seulement un grain etait survenu, venait me supplier de sortir. Et ne voulant pas renoncer a ma lecture, j'allais du moins la continuer au jardin, sous le marronnier, dans une petite guerite en sparterie et en toile au fond de laquelle j'etais assis et me croyais cache aux yeux des personnes qui pourraient venir faire visite a mes parents. Et ma pensee n'etait-elle pas aussi comme une autre creche au fond de laquelle je sentais que je restais enfonce, meme pour regarder ce qui se passait au dehors? Quand je voyais un objet exterieur, la conscience que je le voyais restait entre moi et lui, le bordait d'un mince lisere spirituel qui m'empechait de jamais toucher directement sa matiere; elle se volatilisait en quelque sorte avant que je prisse contact avec elle, comme un corps incandescent qu'on approche d'un objet mouille ne touche pas son humidite parce qu'il se fait toujours preceder d'une zone d'evaporation. Dans l'espece d'ecran diapre d'etats differents que, tandis que je lisais, deployait simultanement ma conscience, et qui allaient des aspirations les plus profondement cachees en moi-meme jusqu'a la vision tout exterieure de l'horizon que j'avais, au bout du jardin, sous les yeux, ce qu'il y avait d'abord en moi, de plus intime, la poignee sans cesse en mouvement qui gouvernait le reste, c'etait ma croyance en la richesse philosophique, en la beaute du livre que je lisais, et mon desir de me les approprier, quel que fut ce livre. Car, meme si je l'avais achete a Combray, en l'apercevant devant l'epicerie Borange, trop distante de la maison pour que Francoise put s'y fournir comme chez Camus, mais mieux achalandee comme papeterie et librairie, retenu par des ficelles dans la mosaique des brochures et des livraisons qui revetaient les deux vantaux de sa porte plus mysterieuse, plus semee de pensees qu'une porte de cathedrale, c'est que je l'avais reconnu pour m'avoir ete cite comme un ouvrage remarquable par le professeur ou le camarade qui me paraissait a cette epoque detenir le secret de la verite et de la beaute a demi pressenties, a demi incomprehensibles, dont la connaissance etait le but vague mais permanent de ma pensee. Apres cette croyance centrale qui, pendant ma lecture, executait d'incessants mouvements du dedans au dehors, vers la decouverte de la verite, venaient les emotions que me donnait l'action a laquelle je prenais part, car ces apres-midi-la etaient plus remplis d'evenements dramatiques que ne l'est souvent toute une vie. C'etait les evenements qui survenaient dans le livre que je lisais; il est vrai que les personnages qu'ils affectaient n'etaient pas Reels, comme disait Francoise. Mais tous les sentiments que nous font eprouver la joie ou l'infortune d'un personnage reel ne se produisent en nous que par l'intermediaire d'une image de cette joie ou de cette infortune; l'ingeniosite du premier romancier consista a comprendre que dans l'appareil de nos emotions, l'image etant le seul element essentiel, la simplification qui consisterait a supprimer purement et simplement les personnages reels serait un perfectionnement decisif. Un etre reel, si profondement que nous sympathisions avec lui, pour une grande part est percu par nos sens, c'est-a-dire nous reste opaque, offre un poids mort que notre sensibilite ne peut soulever. Qu'un malheur le frappe, ce n'est qu'en une petite partie de la notion totale que nous avons de lui, que nous pourrons en etre emus; bien plus, ce n'est qu'en une partie de la notion totale qu'il a de soi qu'il pourra l'etre lui-meme. La trouvaille du romancier a ete d'avoir l'idee de remplacer ces parties impenetrables a l'ame par une quantite egale de parties immaterielles, c'est-a-dire que notre ame peut s'assimiler. Qu'importe des lors que les actions, les emotions de ces etres d'un nouveau genre nous apparaissent comme vraies, puisque nous les avons faites notres, puisque c'est en nous qu'elles se produisent, qu'elles tiennent sous leur dependance, tandis que nous tournons fievreusement les pages du livre, la rapidite de notre respiration et l'intensite de notre regard. Et une fois que le romancier nous a mis dans cet etat, ou comme dans tous les etats purement interieurs, toute emotion est decuplee, ou son livre va nous troubler a la facon d'un reve mais d'un reve plus clair que ceux que nous avons en dormant et dont le souvenir durera davantage, alors, voici qu'il dechaine en nous pendant une heure tous les bonheurs et tous les malheurs possibles dont nous mettrions dans la vie des annees a connaitre quelques-uns, et dont les plus intenses ne nous seraient jamais reveles parce que la lenteur avec laquelle ils se produisent nous en ote la perception; (ainsi notre cur change, dans la vie, et c'est la pire douleur; mais nous ne la connaissons que dans la lecture, en imagination: dans la realite il change, comme certains phenomenes de la nature se produisent, assez lentement pour que, si nous pouvons constater successivement chacun de ses etats differents, en revanche la sensation meme du changement nous soit epargnee). Deja moins interieur a mon corps que cette vie des personnages, venait ensuite, a demi projete devant moi, le paysage ou se deroulait l'action et qui exercait sur ma pensee une bien plus grande influence que l'autre, que celui que j'avais sous les yeux quand je les levais du livre. C'est ainsi que pendant deux etes, dans la chaleur du jardin de Combray, j'ai eu, a cause du livre que je lisais alors, la nostalgie d'un pays montueux et fluviatile, ou je verrais beaucoup de scieries et ou, au fond de l'eau claire, des morceaux de bois pourrissaient sous des touffes de cresson: non loin montaient le long de murs bas, des grappes de fleurs violettes et rougeatres. Et comme le reve d'une femme qui m'aurait aime etait toujours present a ma pensee, ces etes-la ce reve fut impregne de la fraicheur des eaux courantes; et quelle que fut la femme que j'evoquais, des grappes de fleurs violettes et rougeatres s'elevaient aussitot de chaque cote d'elle comme des couleurs complementaires. Ce n'etait pas seulement parce qu'une image dont nous revons reste toujours marquee, s'embellit et beneficie du reflet des couleurs etrangeres qui par hasard l'entourent dans notre reverie; car ces paysages des livres que je lisais n'etaient pas pour moi que des paysages plus vivement representes a mon imagination que ceux que Combray mettait sous mes yeux, mais qui eussent ete analogues. Par le choix qu'en avait fait l'auteur, par la foi avec laquelle ma pensee allait au-devant de sa parole comme d'une revelation, ils me semblaient etre--impression que ne me donnait guere le pays ou je me trouvais, et surtout notre jardin, produit sans prestige de la correcte fantaisie du jardinier que meprisait ma grand'mere--une part veritable de la Nature elle-meme, digne d'etre etudiee et approfondie. Si mes parents m'avaient permis, quand je lisais un livre, d'aller",4.790464301471255,1.831501757205121,0.32112364731880977,0.04885110656041043,4.686098654708521,4.0,2.772634223736279,47.303030303030305,46.0,33.80826942814959,1.3433696348494555,1.0,0.7041352530996543,1561,629,0.4029468289557976,8436,33,22.91425438747139,8944050391.641804,4707394.942969371,0.8555477485060692,0.8479069106040462,45.17335313416034,18.709943509405395,13.606401829973382,21.765542678547163,24.29303981519228,11.128507367072391,71.51827693980161,11.454545454545455,True,54.0,0.8889473684210526,4.44,1900.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02704041204437401,0.01347068145800317,0.009310618066561015,0.009310618066561015,0.0,0.0,0.009904912836767036,0.006438193343898574,0.0026743264659270997,0.15,19,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"visiter la region qu'il decrivait, j'aurais cru faire un pas inestimable dans la conquete de la verite. Car si on a la sensation d'etre toujours entoure de son ame, ce n'est pas comme d'une prison immobile: plutot on est comme emporte avec elle dans un perpetuel elan pour la depasser, pour atteindre a l'exterieur, avec une sorte de decouragement, entendant toujours autour de soi cette sonorite identique qui n'est pas echo du dehors mais retentissement d'une vibration interne. On cherche a retrouver dans les choses, devenues par la precieuses, le reflet que notre ame a projete sur elles; on est decu en constatant qu'elles semblent depourvues dans la nature, du charme qu'elles devaient, dans notre pensee, au voisinage de certaines idees; parfois on convertit toutes les forces de cette ame en habilete, en splendeur pour agir sur des etres dont nous sentons bien qu'ils sont situes en dehors de nous et que nous ne les atteindrons jamais. Aussi, si j'imaginais toujours autour de la femme que j'aimais, les lieux que je desirais le plus alors, si j'eusse voulu que ce fut elle qui me les fit visiter, qui m'ouvrit l'acces d'un monde inconnu, ce n'etait pas par le hasard d'une simple association de pensee; non, c'est que mes reves de voyage et d'amour n'etaient que des moments--que je separe artificiellement aujourd'hui comme si je pratiquais des sections a des hauteurs differentes d'un jet d'eau irise et en apparence immobile--dans un meme et inflechissable jaillissement de toutes les forces de ma vie. Enfin, en continuant a suivre du dedans au dehors les etats simultanement juxtaposes dans ma conscience, et avant d'arriver jusqu'a l'horizon reel qui les enveloppait, je trouve des plaisirs d'un autre genre, celui d'etre bien assis, de sentir la bonne odeur de l'air, de ne pas etre derange par une visite; et, quand une heure sonnait au clocher de Saint-Hilaire, de voir tomber morceau par morceau ce qui de l'apres-midi etait deja consomme, jusqu'a ce que j'entendisse le dernier coup qui me permettait de faire le total et apres lequel, le long silence qui le suivait, semblait faire commencer, dans le ciel bleu, toute la partie qui m'etait encore concedee pour lire jusqu'au bon diner qu'appretait Francoise et qui me reconforterait des fatigues prises, pendant la lecture du livre, a la suite de son heros. Et a chaque heure il me semblait que c'etait quelques instants seulement auparavant que la precedente avait sonne; la plus recente venait s'inscrire tout pres de l'autre dans le ciel et je ne pouvais croire que soixante minutes eussent tenu dans ce petit arc bleu qui etait compris entre leurs deux marques d'or. Quelquefois meme cette heure prematuree sonnait deux coups de plus que la derniere; il y en avait donc une que je n'avais pas entendue, quelque chose qui avait eu lieu n'avait pas eu lieu pour moi; l'interet de la lecture, magique comme un profond sommeil, avait donne le change a mes oreilles hallucinees et efface la cloche d'or sur la surface azuree du silence. Beaux apres-midi du dimanche sous le marronnier du jardin de Combray, soigneusement vides par moi des incidents mediocres de mon existence personnelle que j'y avais remplaces par une vie d'aventures et d'aspirations etranges au sein d'un pays arrose d'eaux vives, vous m'evoquez encore cette vie quand je pense a vous et vous la contenez en effet pour l'avoir peu a peu contournee et enclose--tandis que je progressais dans ma lecture et que tombait la chaleur du jour--dans le cristal successif, lentement changeant et traverse de feuillages, de vos heures silencieuses, sonores, odorantes et limpides. Quelquefois j'etais tire de ma lecture, des le milieu de l'apres-midi par la fille du jardinier, qui courait comme une folle, renversant sur son passage un oranger, se coupant un doigt, se cassant une dent et criant: Les voila, les voila! pour que Francoise et moi nous accourions et ne manquions rien du spectacle. C'etait les jours ou, pour des manuvres de garnison, la troupe traversait Combray, prenant generalement la rue Sainte-Hildegarde. Tandis que nos domestiques, assis en rang sur des chaises en dehors de la grille, regardaient les promeneurs dominicaux de Combray et se faisaient voir d'eux, la fille du jardinier par la fente que laissaient entre elles deux maisons lointaines de l'avenue de la Gare, avait apercu l'eclat des casques. Les domestiques avaient rentre precipitamment leurs chaises, car quand les cuirassiers defilaient rue Sainte-Hildegarde, ils en remplissaient toute la largeur, et le galop des chevaux rasait les maisons couvrant les trottoirs submerges comme des berges qui offrent un lit trop etroit a un torrent dechaine. --Pauvres enfants, disait Francoise a peine arrivee a la grille et deja en larmes; pauvre jeunesse qui sera fauchee comme un pre; rien que d'y penser j'en suis choquee, ajoutait-elle en mettant la main sur son cur, la ou elle avait recu ce choc. --C'est beau, n'est-ce pas, madame Francoise, de voir des jeunes gens qui ne tiennent pas a la vie? disait le jardinier pour la faire monter. Il n'avait pas parle en vain: --De ne pas tenir a la vie? Mais a quoi donc qu'il faut tenir, si ce n'est pas a la vie, le seul cadeau que le bon Dieu ne fasse jamais deux fois. Helas! mon Dieu! C'est pourtant vrai qu'ils n'y tiennent pas! Je les ai vus en 70; ils n'ont plus peur de la mort, dans ces miserables guerres; c'est ni plus ni moins des fous; et puis ils ne valent plus la corde pour les pendre, ce n'est pas des hommes, c'est des lions. (Pour Francoise la comparaison d'un homme a un lion, qu'elle prononcait li-on, n'avait rien de flatteur.) La rue Sainte-Hildegarde tournait trop court pour qu'on put voir venir de loin, et c'etait par cette fente entre les deux maisons de l'avenue de la gare qu'on apercevait toujours de nouveaux casques courant et brillant au soleil. Le jardinier aurait voulu savoir s'il y en avait encore beaucoup a passer, et il avait soif, car le soleil tapait. Alors tout d'un coup, sa fille s'elancant comme d'une place assiegee, faisait une sortie, atteignait l'angle de la rue, et apres avoir brave cent fois la mort, venait nous rapporter, avec une carafe de coco, la nouvelle qu'ils etaient bien un mille qui venaient sans arreter, du cote de Thiberzy et de Meseglise. Francoise et le jardinier, reconcilies, discutaient sur la conduite a tenir en cas de guerre: --Voyez-vous, Francoise, disait le jardinier, la revolution vaudrait mieux, parce que quand on la declare il n'y a que ceux qui veulent partir qui y vont. --Ah! oui, au moins je comprends cela, c'est plus franc. Le jardinier croyait qu'a la declaration de guerre on arretait tous les chemins de fer. --Pardi, pour pas qu'on se sauve, disait Francoise. Et le jardinier: Ah! ils sont malins, car il n'admettait pas que la guerre ne fut pas une espece de mauvais tour que l'Etat essayait de jouer au peuple et que, si on avait eu le moyen de le faire, il n'est pas une seule personne qui n'eut file. Mais Francoise se hatait de rejoindre ma tante, je retournais a mon livre, les domestiques se reinstallaient devant la porte a regarder tomber la poussiere et l'emotion qu'avaient soulevees les soldats. Longtemps apres que l'accalmie etait venue, un flot inaccoutume de promeneurs noircissait encore les rues de Combray. Et devant chaque maison, meme celles ou ce n'etait pas l'habitude, les domestiques ou meme les maitres, assis et regardant, festonnaient le seuil d'un lisere capricieux et sombre comme celui des algues et des coquilles dont une forte maree laisse le crepe et la broderie au rivage, apres qu'elle s'est eloignee. Sauf ces jours-la, je pouvais d'habitude, au contraire, lire tranquille. Mais l'interruption et le commentaire qui furent apportes une fois par une visite de Swann a la lecture que j'etais en train de faire du livre d'un auteur tout nouveau pour moi, Bergotte, eut cette consequence que, pour longtemps, ce ne fut plus sur un mur decore de fleurs violettes en quenouille, mais sur un fond tout autre, devant le portail d'une cathedrale gothique, que se detacha desormais l'image d'une des femmes dont je revais. J'avais entendu parler de Bergotte pour la premiere fois par un de mes camarades plus age que moi et pour qui j'avais une grande admiration, Bloch. En m'entendant lui avouer mon admiration pour la Nuit d'Octobre, il avait fait eclater un rire bruyant comme une trompette et m'avait dit: Defie-toi de ta dilection assez basse pour le sieur de Musset. C'est un coco des plus malfaisants et une assez sinistre brute. Je dois confesser, d'ailleurs, que lui et meme le nomme Racine, ont fait chacun dans leur vie un vers assez bien rythme, et qui a pour lui, ce qui est selon moi le merite supreme, de ne signifier absolument rien. C'est: La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire et La fille de Minos et de Pasiphae. Ils m'ont ete signales a la decharge de ces deux malandrins par un article de mon tres cher maitre, le pere Leconte, agreable aux Dieux Immortels. A propos voici un livre que je n'ai pas le temps de lire en ce moment qui est recommande, parait-il, par cet immense bonhomme. Il tient, m'a-t-on dit, l'auteur, le sieur Bergotte, pour un coco des plus subtils; et bien qu'il fasse preuve, des fois, de mansuetudes assez mal explicables, sa parole est pour moi oracle delphique. Lis donc ces proses lyriques, et si le gigantesque assembleur de rythmes qui a ecrit Bhagavat et le Levrier de Magnus a dit vrai, par Apollon, tu gouteras, cher maitre, les joies nectareennes de l'Olympos. C'est sur un ton sarcastique qu'il m'avait demande de l'appeler cher maitre et qu'il m'appelait lui-meme ainsi. Mais en realite nous prenions un certain plaisir a ce jeu, etant encore rapproches de l'age ou on croit qu'on cree ce qu'on nomme. Malheureusement, je ne pus pas apaiser en causant avec Bloch et en lui demandant des",4.143331949604499,1.7209420628318142,0.3402515989136993,0.07985115963789033,4.545688545688546,4.0,2.625640341491483,31.08,24.0,23.383618197362015,1.3127413127413128,1.0,0.6497240885586437,1554,675,0.4343629343629344,8168,50,24.851651136968,62077605257.21254,32416504.05076373,0.7591530703464333,0.7440385311395706,64.23088494208496,12.02154749034749,10.962023055922355,14.85156241956242,15.52019305019305,9.976267696267694,52.89467181467181,6.78,True,50.0,0.8793733681462141,4.2652741514360315,1915.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00407000407000407,0.003663003663003663,0.00641025641025641,0.14151436031331593,20,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"explications, le trouble ou il m'avait jete quand il m'avait dit que les beaux vers (a moi qui n'attendais d'eux rien moins que la revelation de la verite) etaient d'autant plus beaux qu'ils ne signifiaient rien du tout. Bloch en effet ne fut pas reinvite a la maison. Il y avait d'abord ete bien accueilli. Mon grand-pere, il est vrai, pretendait que chaque fois que je me liais avec un de mes camarades plus qu'avec les autres et que je l'amenais chez nous, c'etait toujours un juif, ce qui ne lui eut pas deplu en principe--meme son ami Swann etait d'origine juive--s'il n'avait trouve que ce n'etait pas d'habitude parmi les meilleurs que je le choisissais. Aussi quand j'amenais un nouvel ami il etait bien rare qu'il ne fredonnat pas: O Dieu de nos Peres de la Juive ou bien Israel romps ta chaine, ne chantant que l'air naturellement (Ti la lam ta lam, talim), mais j'avais peur que mon camarade ne le connut et ne retablit les paroles. Avant de les avoir vus, rien qu'en entendant leur nom qui, bien souvent, n'avait rien de particulierement israelite, il devinait non seulement l'origine juive de ceux de mes amis qui l'etaient en effet, mais meme ce qu'il y avait quelquefois de facheux dans leur famille. --Et comment s'appelle-t-il ton ami qui vient ce soir? --Dumont, grand-pere. --Dumont! Oh! je me mefie. Et il chantait: Archers, faites bonne garde! Veillez sans treve et sans bruit; Et apres nous avoir pose adroitement quelques questions plus precises, il s'ecriait: A la garde! A la garde! ou, si c'etait le patient lui-meme deja arrive qu'il avait force a son insu, par un interrogatoire dissimule, a confesser ses origines, alors pour nous montrer qu'il n'avait plus aucun doute, il se contentait de nous regarder en fredonnant imperceptiblement: De ce timide Israelite Quoi! vous guidez ici les pas! Champs paternels, Hebron, douce vallee. ou encore: Oui, je suis de la race elue. Ces petites manies de mon grand-pere n'impliquaient aucun sentiment malveillant a l'endroit de mes camarades. Mais Bloch avait deplu a mes parents pour d'autres raisons. Il avait commence par agacer mon pere qui, le voyant mouille, lui avait dit avec interet: --Mais, monsieur Bloch, quel temps fait-il donc, est-ce qu'il a plu? Je n'y comprends rien, le barometre etait excellent. Il n'en avait tire que cette reponse: --Monsieur, je ne puis absolument vous dire s'il a plu. Je vis si resolument en dehors des contingences physiques que mes sens ne prennent pas la peine de me les notifier. --Mais, mon pauvre fils, il est idiot ton ami, m'avait dit mon pere quand Bloch fut parti. Comment! il ne peut meme pas me dire le temps qu'il fait! Mais il n'y a rien de plus interessant! C'est un imbecile. Puis Bloch avait deplu a ma grand'mere parce que, apres le dejeuner comme elle disait qu'elle etait un peu souffrante, il avait etouffe un sanglot et essuye des larmes. --Comment veux-tu que ca soit sincere, me dit-elle, puisqu'il ne me connait pas; ou bien alors il est fou. Et enfin il avait mecontente tout le monde parce que, etant venu dejeuner une heure et demie en retard et couvert de boue, au lieu de s'excuser, il avait dit: --Je ne me laisse jamais influencer par les perturbations de l'atmosphere ni par les divisions conventionnelles du temps. Je rehabiliterais volontiers l'usage de la pipe d'opium et du kriss malais, mais j'ignore celui de ces instruments infiniment plus pernicieux et d'ailleurs platement bourgeois, la montre et le parapluie. Il serait malgre tout revenu a Combray. Il n'etait pas pourtant l'ami que mes parents eussent souhaite pour moi; ils avaient fini par penser que les larmes que lui avait fait verser l'indisposition de ma grand'mere n'etaient pas feintes; mais ils savaient d'instinct ou par experience que les elans de notre sensibilite ont peu d'empire sur la suite de nos actes et la conduite de notre vie, et que le respect des obligations morales, la fidelite aux amis, l'execution d'une uvre, l'observance d'un regime, ont un fondement plus sur dans des habitudes aveugles que dans ces transports momentanes, ardents et steriles. Ils auraient prefere pour moi a Bloch des compagnons qui ne me donneraient pas plus qu'il n'est convenu d'accorder a ses amis, selon les regles de la morale bourgeoise; qui ne m'enverraient pas inopinement une corbeille de fruits parce qu'ils auraient ce jour-la pense a moi avec tendresse, mais qui, n'etant pas capables de faire pencher en ma faveur la juste balance des devoirs et des exigences de l'amitie sur un simple mouvement de leur imagination et de leur sensibilite, ne la fausseraient pas davantage a mon prejudice. Nos torts meme font difficilement departir de ce qu'elles nous doivent ces natures dont ma grand'tante etait le modele, elle qui brouillee depuis des annees avec une niece a qui elle ne parlait jamais, ne modifia pas pour cela le testament ou elle lui laissait toute sa fortune, parce que c'etait sa plus proche parente et que cela se devait. Mais j'aimais Bloch, mes parents voulaient me faire plaisir, les problemes insolubles que je me posais a propos de la beaute denuee de signification de la fille de Minos et de Pasiphae me fatiguaient davantage et me rendaient plus souffrant que n'auraient fait de nouvelles conversations avec lui, bien que ma mere les jugeat pernicieuses. Et on l'aurait encore recu a Combray si, apres ce diner, comme il venait de m'apprendre--nouvelle qui plus tard eut beaucoup d'influence sur ma vie, et la rendit plus heureuse, puis plus malheureuse--que toutes les femmes ne pensaient qu'a l'amour et qu'il n'y en a pas dont on ne put vaincre les resistances, il ne m'avait assure avoir entendu dire de la facon la plus certaine que ma grand'tante avait eu une jeunesse orageuse et avait ete publiquement entretenue. Je ne pus me tenir de repeter ces propos a mes parents, on le mit a la porte quand il revint, et quand je l'abordai ensuite dans la rue, il fut extremement froid pour moi. Mais au sujet de Bergotte il avait dit vrai. Les premiers jours, comme un air de musique dont on raffolera, mais qu'on ne distingue pas encore, ce que je devais tant aimer dans son style ne m'apparut pas. Je ne pouvais pas quitter le roman que je lisais de lui, mais me croyais seulement interesse par le sujet, comme dans ces premiers moments de l'amour ou on va tous les jours retrouver une femme a quelque reunion, a quelque divertissement par les agrements desquels on se croit attire. Puis je remarquai les expressions rares, presque archaiques qu'il aimait employer a certains moments ou un flot cache d'harmonie, un prelude interieur, soulevait son style; et c'etait aussi a ces moments-la qu'il se mettait a parler du vain songe de la vie, de l'inepuisable torrent des belles apparences, du tourment sterile et delicieux de comprendre et d'aimer, des emouvantes effigies qui anoblissent a jamais la facade venerable et charmante des cathedrales, qu'il exprimait toute une philosophie nouvelle pour moi par de merveilleuses images dont on aurait dit que c'etait elles qui avaient eveille ce chant de harpes qui s'elevait alors et a l'accompagnement duquel elles donnaient quelque chose de sublime. Un de ces passages de Bergotte, le troisieme ou le quatrieme que j'eusse isole du reste, me donna une joie incomparable a celle que j'avais trouvee au premier, une joie que je me sentis eprouver en une region plus profonde de moi-meme, plus unie, plus vaste, d'ou les obstacles et les separations semblaient avoir ete enleves. C'est que, reconnaissant alors ce meme gout pour les expressions rares, cette meme effusion musicale, cette meme philosophie idealiste qui avait deja ete les autres fois, sans que je m'en rendisse compte, la cause de mon plaisir, je n'eus plus l'impression d'etre en presence d'un morceau particulier d'un certain livre de Bergotte, tracant a la surface de ma pensee une figure purement lineaire, mais plutot du morceau ideal de Bergotte, commun a tous ses livres et auquel tous les passages analogues qui venaient se confondre avec lui, auraient donne une sorte d'epaisseur, de volume, dont mon esprit semblait agrandi. Je n'etais pas tout a fait le seul admirateur de Bergotte; il etait aussi l'ecrivain prefere d'une amie de ma mere qui etait tres lettree; enfin pour lire son dernier livre paru, le docteur du Boulbon faisait attendre ses malades; et ce fut de son cabinet de consultation, et d'un parc voisin de Combray, que s'envolerent quelques-unes des premieres graines de cette predilection pour Bergotte, espece si rare alors, aujourd'hui universellement repandue, et dont on trouve partout en Europe, en Amerique, jusque dans le moindre village, la fleur ideale et commune. Ce que l'amie de ma mere et, parait-il, le docteur du Boulbon aimaient surtout dans les livres de Bergotte c'etait comme moi, ce meme flux melodique, ces expressions anciennes, quelques autres tres simples et connues, mais pour lesquelles la place ou il les mettait en lumiere semblait reveler de sa part un gout particulier; enfin, dans les passages tristes, une certaine brusquerie, un accent presque rauque. Et sans doute lui-meme devait sentir que la etaient ses plus grands charmes. Car dans les livres qui suivirent, s'il avait rencontre quelque grande verite, ou le nom d'une celebre cathedrale, il interrompait son recit et dans une invocation, une apostrophe, une longue priere, il donnait un libre cours a ces effluves qui dans ses premiers ouvrages restaient interieurs a sa prose, deceles seulement alors par les ondulations de la surface, plus douces peut-etre encore, plus harmonieuses quand elles etaient ainsi voilees et qu'on n'aurait pu indiquer d'une maniere precise ou naissait, ou expirait leur murmure. Ces morceaux auxquels il se complaisait etaient nos morceaux preferes. Pour moi, je les savais par cur. J'etais decu quand il reprenait le fil de son recit. Chaque fois qu'il parlait de quelque chose dont la beaute m'etait restee jusque-la cachee, des forets de pins, de la grele,",3.506395848246817,1.9274216505860773,0.37826881160310877,0.11415724439437379,4.563497128270581,4.0,2.6722034670526242,25.688524590163933,12.0,25.96058865659514,1.3222718570516911,1.0,0.678906696541858,1567,652,0.41608168474792595,8294,61,24.711046089662076,53935034242.70987,28135124.800578963,0.6767073765722065,0.6567559957630553,68.89694843441055,10.031332503373893,10.480003223191101,12.853584692479103,12.9083337692364,9.881097638800252,48.53472752570956,5.868852459016393,True,70.0,0.881585811163276,4.326551904016693,1917.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004621257785814748,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005525416917821981,0.0028129395218002813,0.0,0.1465832029212311,21,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"Charlus, et je pensais que nous devions etre pour elle un objet de mepris, ce qui me peinait surtout a cause de Mlle Swann qu'on m'avait dit etre une si jolie petite fille et a laquelle je revais souvent en lui pretant chaque fois un meme visage arbitraire et charmant. Mais quand j'eus appris ce jour-la que Mlle Swann etait un etre d'une condition si rare, baignant comme dans son element naturel au milieu de tant de privileges, que quand elle demandait a ses parents s'il y avait quelqu'un a diner, on lui repondait par ces syllabes remplies de lumiere, par le nom de ce convive d'or qui n'etait pour elle qu'un vieil ami de sa famille: Bergotte; que, pour elle, la causerie intime a table, ce qui correspondait a ce qu'etait pour moi la conversation de ma grand'tante, c'etaient des paroles de Bergotte sur tous ces sujets qu'il n'avait pu aborder dans ses livres, et sur lesquels j'aurais voulu l'ecouter rendre ses oracles, et qu'enfin, quand elle allait visiter des villes, il cheminait a cote d'elle, inconnu et glorieux, comme les Dieux qui descendaient au milieu des mortels, alors je sentis en meme temps que le prix d'un etre comme Mlle Swann, combien je lui paraitrais grossier et ignorant, et j'eprouvai si vivement la douceur et l'impossibilite qu'il y aurait pour moi a etre son ami, que je fus rempli a la fois de desir et de desespoir. Le plus souvent maintenant quand je pensais a elle, je la voyais devant le porche d'une cathedrale, m'expliquant la signification des statues, et, avec un sourire qui disait du bien de moi, me presentant comme son ami, a Bergotte. Et toujours le charme de toutes les idees que faisaient naitre en moi les cathedrales, le charme des coteaux de l'Ile-de-France et des plaines de la Normandie faisait refluer ses reflets sur l'image que je me formais de Mlle Swann: c'etait etre tout pret a l'aimer. Que nous croyions qu'un etre participe a une vie inconnue ou son amour nous ferait penetrer, c'est, de tout ce qu'exige l'amour pour naitre, ce a quoi il tient le plus, et qui lui fait faire bon marche du reste. Meme les femmes qui pretendent ne juger un homme que sur son physique, voient en ce physique l'emanation d'une vie speciale. C'est pourquoi elles aiment les militaires, les pompiers; l'uniforme les rend moins difficiles pour le visage; elles croient baiser sous la cuirasse un cur different, aventureux et doux; et un jeune souverain, un prince heritier, pour faire les plus flatteuses conquetes, dans les pays etrangers qu'il visite, n'a pas besoin du profil regulier qui serait peut-etre indispensable a un coulissier. Tandis que je lisais au jardin, ce que ma grand'tante n'aurait pas compris que je fisse en dehors du dimanche, jour ou il est defendu de s'occuper a rien de serieux et ou elle ne cousait pas (un jour de semaine, elle m'aurait dit Comment tu t'amuses encore a lire, ce n'est pourtant pas dimanche en donnant au mot amusement le sens d'enfantillage et de perte de temps), ma tante Leonie devisait avec Francoise en attendant l'heure d'Eulalie. Elle lui annoncait qu'elle venait de voir passer Mme Goupil sans parapluie, avec la robe de soie qu'elle s'est fait faire a Chateaudun. Si elle a loin a aller avant vepres elle pourrait bien la faire saucer. --Peut-etre, peut-etre (ce qui signifiait peut-etre non) disait Francoise pour ne pas ecarter definitivement la possibilite d'une alternative plus favorable. --Tiens, disait ma tante en se frappant le front, cela me fait penser que je n'ai point su si elle etait arrivee a l'eglise apres l'elevation. Il faudra que je pense a le demander a Eulalie... Francoise, regardez-moi ce nuage noir derriere le clocher et ce mauvais soleil sur les ardoises, bien sur que la journee ne se passera pas sans pluie. Ce n'etait pas possible que ca reste comme ca, il faisait trop chaud. Et le plus tot sera le mieux, car tant que l'orage n'aura pas eclate, mon eau de Vichy ne descendra pas, ajoutait ma tante dans l'esprit de qui le desir de hater la descente de l'eau de Vichy l'emportait infiniment sur la crainte de voir Mme Goupil gater sa robe. --Peut-etre, peut-etre. --Et c'est que, quand il pleut sur la place, il n'y a pas grand abri. --Comment, trois heures? s'ecriait tout a coup ma tante en palissant, mais alors les vepres sont commencees, j'ai oublie ma pepsine! Je comprends maintenant pourquoi mon eau de Vichy me restait sur l'estomac. Et se precipitant sur un livre de messe relie en velours violet, monte d'or, et d'ou, dans sa hate, elle laissait s'echapper de ces images, bordees d'un bandeau de dentelle de papier jaunissante, qui marquent les pages des fetes, ma tante, tout en avalant ses gouttes commencait a lire au plus vite les textes sacres dont l'intelligence lui etait legerement obscurcie par l'incertitude de savoir si, prise aussi longtemps apres l'eau de Vichy, la pepsine serait encore capable de la rattraper et de la faire descendre. Trois heures, c'est incroyable ce que le temps passe! Un petit coup au carreau, comme si quelque chose l'avait heurte, suivi d'une ample chute legere comme de grains de sable qu'on eut laisse tomber d'une fenetre au-dessus, puis la chute s'etendant, se reglant, adoptant un rythme, devenant fluide, sonore, musicale, innombrable, universelle: c'etait la pluie. --Eh bien! Francoise, qu'est-ce que je disais? Ce que cela tombe! Mais je crois que j'ai entendu le grelot de la porte du jardin, allez donc voir qui est-ce qui peut etre dehors par un temps pareil. Francoise revenait: --C'est Mme Amedee (ma grand'mere) qui a dit qu'elle allait faire un tour. Ca pleut pourtant fort. --Cela ne me surprend point, disait ma tante en levant les yeux au ciel. J'ai toujours dit qu'elle n'avait point l'esprit fait comme tout le monde. J'aime mieux que ce soit elle que moi qui soit dehors en ce moment. --Mme Amedee, c'est toujours tout l'extreme des autres, disait Francoise avec douceur, reservant pour le moment ou elle serait seule avec les autres domestiques, de dire qu'elle croyait ma grand'mere un peu piquee. --Voila le salut passe! Eulalie ne viendra plus, soupirait ma tante; ce sera le temps qui lui aura fait peur. --Mais il n'est pas cinq heures, madame Octave, il n'est que quatre heures et demie. --Que quatre heures et demie? et j'ai ete obligee de relever les petits rideaux pour avoir un mechant rayon de jour. A quatre heures et demie! Huit jours avant les Rogations! Ah! ma pauvre Francoise, il faut que le bon Dieu soit bien en colere apres nous. Aussi, le monde d'aujourd'hui en fait trop! Comme disait mon pauvre Octave, on a trop oublie le bon Dieu et il se venge. Une vive rougeur animait les joues de ma tante, c'etait Eulalie. Malheureusement, a peine venait-elle d'etre introduite que Francoise rentrait et avec un sourire qui avait pour but de se mettre elle-meme a l'unisson de la joie qu'elle ne doutait pas que ses paroles allaient causer a ma tante, articulant les syllabes pour montrer que, malgre l'emploi du style indirect, elle rapportait, en bonne domestique, les paroles memes dont avait daigne se servir le visiteur: le Cure serait enchante, ravi, si Madame Octave ne repose pas et pouvait le recevoir. M. le Cure ne veut pas deranger. M. le Cure est en bas, j'y ai dit d'entrer dans la salle. En realite, les visites du cure ne faisaient pas a ma tante un aussi grand plaisir que le supposait Francoise et l'air de jubilation dont celle-ci croyait devoir pavoiser son visage chaque fois qu'elle avait a l'annoncer ne repondait pas entierement au sentiment de la malade. Le cure (excellent homme avec qui je regrette de ne pas avoir cause davantage, car s'il n'entendait rien aux arts, il connaissait beaucoup d'etymologies), habitue a donner aux visiteurs de marque des renseignements sur l'eglise (il avait meme l'intention d'ecrire un livre sur la paroisse de Combray), la fatiguait par des explications infinies et d'ailleurs toujours les memes. Mais quand elle arrivait ainsi juste en meme temps que celle d'Eulalie, sa visite devenait franchement desagreable a ma tante. Elle eut mieux aime bien profiter d'Eulalie et ne pas avoir tout le monde a la fois. Mais elle n'osait pas ne pas recevoir le cure et faisait seulement signe a Eulalie de ne pas s'en aller en meme temps que lui, qu'elle la garderait un peu seule quand il serait parti. --Monsieur le Cure, qu'est-ce que l'on me disait, qu'il y a un artiste qui a installe son chevalet dans votre eglise pour copier un vitrail. Je peux dire que je suis arrivee a mon age sans avoir jamais entendu parler d'une chose pareille! Qu'est-ce que le monde aujourd'hui va donc chercher! Et ce qu'il y a de plus vilain dans l'eglise! --Je n'irai pas jusqu'a dire que c'est ce qu'il y a de plus vilain, car s'il y a a Saint-Hilaire des parties qui meritent d'etre visitees, il y en a d'autres qui sont bien vieilles, dans ma pauvre basilique, la seule de tout le diocese qu'on n'ait meme pas restauree! Mon Dieu, le porche est sale et antique, mais enfin d'un caractere majestueux; passe meme pour les tapisseries d'Esther dont personnellement je ne donnerais pas deux sous, mais qui sont placees par les connaisseurs tout de suite apres celles de Sens. Je reconnais d'ailleurs, qu'a cote de certains details un peu realistes, elles en presentent d'autres qui temoignent d'un veritable esprit d'observation. Mais qu'on ne vienne pas me parler des vitraux. Cela a-t-il du bon sens de laisser des fenetres qui ne donnent pas de jour et trompent meme la vue par ces reflets d'une couleur que je ne saurais definir, dans une eglise ou il n'y a pas deux dalles qui soient au meme niveau et qu'on se refuse a me remplacer sous pretexte que ce sont les tombes des abbes de Combray",4.006677554300931,1.9821069193161185,0.2983607751712446,0.10801633229887946,4.375568551007148,4.0,2.435246034233518,24.046875,16.0,26.339982493053693,1.2910981156595192,1.0,0.6262547089513808,1539,596,0.387264457439896,7988,64,25.37640181767641,104913476878.51794,54871065.313032396,0.663706941737069,0.6663763726528193,73.2005212902047,9.02323901478233,10.05249126169394,12.06189489928525,11.202365375243666,8.697413905133203,43.21516609811566,4.609375,True,69.0,0.8817991631799164,4.177824267782427,1912.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01782752902155887,0.010572139303482588,0.010572139303482588,0.004975124378109453,0.0,0.0,0.00912106135986733,0.0037313432835820895,0.005286069651741294,0.12656903765690378,23,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"de Notre-Dame de Paris, d'Athalie ou de Phedre, il faisait dans une image exploser cette beaute jusqu'a moi. Aussi sentant combien il y avait de parties de l'univers que ma perception infirme ne distinguerait pas s'il ne les rapprochait de moi, j'aurais voulu posseder une opinion de lui, une metaphore de lui, sur toutes choses, surtout sur celles que j'aurais l'occasion de voir moi-meme, et entre celles-la, particulierement sur d'anciens monuments francais et certains paysages maritimes, parce que l'insistance avec laquelle il les citait dans ses livres prouvait qu'il les tenait pour riches de signification et de beaute. Malheureusement sur presque toutes choses j'ignorais son opinion. Je ne doutais pas qu'elle ne fut entierement differente des miennes, puisqu'elle descendait d'un monde inconnu vers lequel je cherchais a m'elever: persuade que mes pensees eussent paru pure ineptie a cet esprit parfait, j'avais tellement fait table rase de toutes, que quand par hasard il m'arriva d'en rencontrer, dans tel de ses livres, une que j'avais deja eue moi-meme, mon cur se gonflait comme si un Dieu dans sa bonte me l'avait rendue, l'avait declaree legitime et belle. Il arrivait parfois qu'une page de lui disait les memes choses que j'ecrivais souvent la nuit a ma grand'mere et a ma mere quand je ne pouvais pas dormir, si bien que cette page de Bergotte avait l'air d'un recueil d'epigraphes pour etre placees en tete de mes lettres. Meme plus tard, quand je commencai de composer un livre, certaines phrases dont la qualite ne suffit pas pour me decider a le continuer, j'en retrouvai l'equivalent dans Bergotte. Mais ce n'etait qu'alors, quand je les lisais dans son uvre, que je pouvais en jouir; quand c'etait moi qui les composais, preoccupe qu'elles refletassent exactement ce que j'apercevais dans ma pensee, craignant de ne pas faire ressemblant, j'avais bien le temps de me demander si ce que j'ecrivais etait agreable! Mais en realite il n'y avait que ce genre de phrases, ce genre d'idees que j'aimais vraiment. Mes efforts inquiets et mecontents etaient eux-memes une marque d'amour, d'amour sans plaisir mais profond. Aussi quand tout d'un coup je trouvais de telles phrases dans l'uvre d'un autre, c'est-a-dire sans plus avoir de scrupules, de severite, sans avoir a me tourmenter, je me laissais enfin aller avec delices au gout que j'avais pour elles, comme un cuisinier qui pour une fois ou il n'a pas a faire la cuisine trouve enfin le temps d'etre gourmand. Un jour, ayant rencontre dans un livre de Bergotte, a propos d'une vieille servante, une plaisanterie que le magnifique et solennel langage de l'ecrivain rendait encore plus ironique mais qui etait la meme que j'avais souvent faite a ma grand'mere en parlant de Francoise, une autre fois ou je vis qu'il ne jugeait pas indigne de figurer dans un de ces miroirs de la verite qu'etaient ses ouvrages, une remarque analogue a celle que j'avais eu l'occasion de faire sur notre ami M. Legrandin (remarques sur Francoise et M. Legrandin qui etaient certes de celles que j'eusse le plus deliberement sacrifiees a Bergotte, persuade qu'il les trouverait sans interet), il me sembla soudain que mon humble vie et les royaumes du vrai n'etaient pas aussi separes que j'avais cru, qu'ils coincidaient meme sur certains points, et de confiance et de joie je pleurai sur les pages de l'ecrivain comme dans les bras d'un pere retrouve. D'apres ses livres j'imaginais Bergotte comme un vieillard faible et decu qui avait perdu des enfants et ne s'etait jamais console. Aussi je lisais, je chantais interieurement sa prose, plus dolce, plus lento peut-etre qu'elle n'etait ecrite, et la phrase la plus simple s'adressait a moi avec une intonation attendrie. Plus que tout j'aimais sa philosophie, je m'etais donne a elle pour toujours. Elle me rendait impatient d'arriver a l'age ou j'entrerais au college, dans la classe appelee Philosophie. Mais je ne voulais pas qu'on y fit autre chose que vivre uniquement par la pensee de Bergotte, et si l'on m'avait dit que les metaphysiciens auxquels je m'attacherais alors ne lui ressembleraient en rien, j'aurais ressenti le desespoir d'un amoureux qui veut aimer pour la vie et a qui on parle des autres maitresses qu'il aura plus tard. Un dimanche, pendant ma lecture au jardin, je fus derange par Swann qui venait voir mes parents. --Qu'est-ce que vous lisez, on peut regarder? Tiens, du Bergotte? Qui donc vous a indique ses ouvrages? Je lui dis que c'etait Bloch. --Ah! oui, ce garcon que j'ai vu une fois ici, qui ressemble tellement au portrait de Mahomet II par Bellini. Oh! c'est frappant, il a les memes sourcils circonflexes, le meme nez recourbe, les memes pommettes saillantes. Quand il aura une barbiche ce sera la meme personne. En tout cas il a du gout, car Bergotte est un charmant esprit. Et voyant combien j'avais l'air d'admirer Bergotte, Swann qui ne parlait jamais des gens qu'il connaissait fit, par bonte, une exception et me dit: --Je le connais beaucoup, si cela pouvait vous faire plaisir qu'il ecrive un mot en tete de votre volume, je pourrais le lui demander. Je n'osai pas accepter mais posai a Swann des questions sur Bergotte. Est-ce que vous pourriez me dire quel est l'acteur qu'il prefere? --L'acteur, je ne sais pas. Mais je sais qu'il n'egale aucun artiste homme a la Berma qu'il met au-dessus de tout. L'avez-vous entendue? --Non monsieur, mes parents ne me permettent pas d'aller au theatre. --C'est malheureux. Vous devriez leur demander. La Berma dans Phedre, dans le Cid, ce n'est qu'une actrice si vous voulez, mais vous savez je ne crois pas beaucoup a la hierarchie! des arts; (et je remarquai, comme cela m'avait souvent frappe dans ses conversations avec les surs de ma grand'mere que quand il parlait de choses serieuses, quand il employait une expression qui semblait impliquer une opinion sur un sujet important, il avait soin de l'isoler dans une intonation speciale, machinale et ironique, comme s'il l'avait mise entre guillemets, semblant ne pas vouloir la prendre a son compte, et dire: la hierarchie, vous savez, comme disent les gens ridicules? Mais alors, si c'etait ridicule, pourquoi disait-il la hierarchie?). Un instant apres il ajouta: Cela vous donnera une vision aussi noble que n'importe quel chef-d'uvre, je ne sais pas moi... que--et il se mit a rire--les Reines de Chartres! Jusque-la cette horreur d'exprimer serieusement son opinion m'avait paru quelque chose qui devait etre elegant et parisien et qui s'opposait au dogmatisme provincial des surs de ma grand'mere; et je soupconnais aussi que c'etait une des formes de l'esprit dans la coterie ou vivait Swann et ou par reaction sur le lyrisme des generations anterieures on rehabilitait a l'exces les petits faits precis, reputes vulgaires autrefois, et on proscrivait les phrases. Mais maintenant je trouvais quelque chose de choquant dans cette attitude de Swann en face des choses. Il avait l'air de ne pas oser avoir une opinion et de n'etre tranquille que quand il pouvait donner meticuleusement des renseignements precis. Mais il ne se rendait donc pas compte que c'etait professer l'opinion, postuler, que l'exactitude de ces details avait de l'importance. Je repensai alors a ce diner ou j'etais si triste parce que maman ne devait pas monter dans ma chambre et ou il avait dit que les bals chez la princesse de Leon n'avaient aucune importance. Mais c'etait pourtant a ce genre de plaisirs qu'il employait sa vie. Je trouvais tout cela contradictoire. Pour quelle autre vie reservait-il de dire enfin serieusement ce qu'il pensait des choses, de formuler des jugements qu'il put ne pas mettre entre guillemets, et de ne plus se livrer avec une politesse pointilleuse a des occupations dont il professait en meme temps qu'elles sont ridicules? Je remarquai aussi dans la facon dont Swann me parla de Bergotte quelque chose qui en revanche ne lui etait pas particulier mais au contraire etait dans ce temps-la commun a tous les admirateurs de l'ecrivain, a l'amie de ma mere, au docteur du Boulbon. Comme Swann, ils disaient de Bergotte: C'est un charmant esprit, si particulier, il a une facon a lui de dire les choses un peu cherchee, mais si agreable. On n'a pas besoin de voir la signature, on reconnait tout de suite que c'est de lui. Mais aucun n'aurait ete jusqu'a dire: C'est un grand ecrivain, il a un grand talent. Ils ne disaient meme pas qu'il avait du talent. Ils ne le disaient pas parce qu'ils ne le savaient pas. Nous sommes tres longs a reconnaitre dans la physionomie particuliere d'un nouvel ecrivain le modele qui porte le nom de grand talent dans notre musee des idees generales. Justement parce que cette physionomie est nouvelle nous ne la trouvons pas tout a fait ressemblante a ce que nous appelons talent. Nous disons plutot originalite, charme, delicatesse, force; et puis un jour nous nous rendons compte que c'est justement tout cela le talent. --Est-ce qu'il y a des ouvrages de Bergotte ou il ait parle de la Berma? demandai-je a M. Swann. --Je crois dans sa petite plaquette sur Racine, mais elle doit etre epuisee. Il y a peut-etre eu cependant une reimpression. Je m'informerai. Je peux d'ailleurs demander a Bergotte tout ce que vous voulez, il n'y a pas de semaine dans l'annee ou il ne dine a la maison. C'est le grand ami de ma fille. Ils vont ensemble visiter les vieilles villes, les cathedrales, les chateaux. Comme je n'avais aucune notion sur la hierarchie sociale, depuis longtemps l'impossibilite que mon pere trouvait a ce que nous frequentions Mme et Mlle Swann avait eu plutot pour effet, en me faisant imaginer entre elles et nous de grandes distances, de leur donner a mes yeux du prestige. Je regrettais que ma mere ne se teignit pas les cheveux et ne se mit pas de rouge aux levres comme j'avais entendu dire par notre voisine Mme Sazerat que Mme Swann le faisait pour plaire, non a son mari, mais a M. de",3.450409287254429,1.6395127515197312,0.3552726977090741,0.10723266181162354,4.525732899022802,4.0,2.6373332635428,22.246376811594203,15.0,22.479882018555124,1.3003257328990228,1.0,0.6181562567358893,1535,586,0.3817589576547231,8246,69,24.6109745203964,48798944496.25032,25724272.2700318,0.7013313820695176,0.6953859645039288,74.24737053297457,8.42993060473021,9.796926906284678,11.348062125289147,11.009390360194494,9.480755700325734,45.17797290279941,5.101449275362318,True,68.0,0.8887717448603057,4.3468634686346865,1897.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0032303654350898446,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.002826569755703614,0.003331314354936402,0.0,0.14865577227200844,22,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"et des seigneurs de Guermantes, les anciens comtes de Brabant. Les ancetres directs du duc de Guermantes d'aujourd'hui et aussi de la Duchesse puisqu'elle est une demoiselle de Guermantes qui a epouse son cousin. (Ma grand'mere qui a force de se desinteresser des personnes finissait par confondre tous les noms, chaque fois qu'on prononcait celui de la Duchesse de Guermantes pretendait que ce devait etre une parente de Mme de Villeparisis. Tout le monde eclatait de rire; elle tachait de se defendre en alleguant une certaine lettre de faire part: Il me semblait me rappeler qu'il y avait du Guermantes la-dedans. Et pour une fois j'etais avec les autres contre elle, ne pouvant admettre qu'il y eut un lien entre son amie de pension et la descendante de Genevieve de Brabant.)--Voyez Roussainville, ce n'est plus aujourd'hui qu'une paroisse de fermiers, quoique dans l'antiquite cette localite ait du un grand essor au commerce de chapeaux de feutre et des pendules. (Je ne suis pas certain de l'etymologie de Roussainville. Je croirais volontiers que le nom primitif etait Rouville (Radulfi villa) comme Chateauroux (Castrum Radulfi) mais je vous parlerai de cela une autre fois. He bien! l'eglise a des vitraux superbes, presque tous modernes, et cette imposante Entree de Louis-Philippe a Combray qui serait mieux a sa place a Combray meme, et qui vaut, dit-on, la fameuse verriere de Chartres. Je voyais meme hier le frere du docteur Percepied qui est amateur et qui la regarde comme d'un plus beau travail. Mais, comme je le lui disais, a cet artiste qui semble du reste tres poli, qui est parait-il, un veritable virtuose du pinceau, que lui trouvez-vous donc d'extraordinaire a ce vitrail, qui est encore un peu plus sombre que les autres? --Je suis sure que si vous le demandiez a Monseigneur, disait mollement ma tante qui commencait a penser qu'elle allait etre fatiguee, il ne vous refuserait pas un vitrail neuf. --Comptez-y, madame Octave, repondait le cure. Mais c'est justement Monseigneur qui a attache le grelot a cette malheureuse verriere en prouvant qu'elle represente Gilbert le Mauvais, sire de Guermantes, le descendant direct de Genevieve de Brabant qui etait une demoiselle de Guermantes, recevant l'absolution de Saint-Hilaire. --Mais je ne vois pas ou est Saint-Hilaire? --Mais si, dans le coin du vitrail vous n'avez jamais remarque une dame en robe jaune? He bien! c'est Saint-Hilaire qu'on appelle aussi, vous le savez, dans certaines provinces, Saint-Illiers, Saint-Helier, et meme, dans le Jura, Saint-Ylie. Ces diverses corruptions de sanctus Hilarius ne sont pas du reste les plus curieuses de celles qui se sont produites dans les noms des bienheureux. Ainsi votre patronne, ma bonne Eulalie, sancta Eulalia, savez-vous ce qu'elle est devenue en Bourgogne? Saint-Eloi tout simplement: elle est devenue un saint. Voyez-vous, Eulalie, qu'apres votre mort on fasse de vous un homme? --Monsieur le Cure a toujours le mot pour rigoler.--Le frere de Gilbert, Charles le Begue, prince pieux mais qui, ayant perdu de bonne heure son pere, Pepin l'Insense, mort des suites de sa maladie mentale, exercait le pouvoir supreme avec toute la presomption d'une jeunesse a qui la discipline a manque; des que la figure d'un particulier ne lui revenait pas dans une ville, il y faisait massacrer jusqu'au dernier habitant. Gilbert voulant se venger de Charles fit bruler l'eglise de Combray, la primitive eglise alors, celle que Theodebert, en quittant avec sa cour la maison de campagne qu'il avait pres d'ici, a Thiberzy (Theodeberciacus), pour aller combattre les Burgondes, avait promis de batir au-dessus du tombeau de Saint-Hilaire, si le Bienheureux lui procurait la victoire. Il n'en reste que la crypte ou Theodore a du vous faire descendre, puisque Gilbert brula le reste. Ensuite il defit l'infortune Charles avec l'aide de Guillaume Le Conquerant (le cure prononcait Guilome), ce qui fait que beaucoup d'Anglais viennent pour visiter. Mais il ne semble pas avoir su se concilier la sympathie des habitants de Combray, car ceux-ci se ruerent sur lui a la sortie de la messe et lui trancherent la tete. Du reste Theodore prete un petit livre qui donne les explications. Mais ce qui est incontestablement le plus curieux dans notre eglise, c'est le point de vue qu'on a du clocher et qui est grandiose. Certainement, pour vous qui n'etes pas tres forte, je ne vous conseillerais pas de monter nos quatre-vingt-dix-sept marches, juste la moitie du celebre dome de Milan. Il y a de quoi fatiguer une personne bien portante, d'autant plus qu'on monte plie en deux si on ne veut pas se casser la tete, et on ramasse avec ses effets toutes les toiles d'araignees de l'escalier. En tous cas il faudrait bien vous couvrir, ajoutait-il (sans apercevoir l'indignation que causait a ma tante l'idee qu'elle fut capable de monter dans le clocher), car il fait un de ces courants d'air une fois arrive la-haut! Certaines personnes affirment y avoir ressenti le froid de la mort. N'importe, le dimanche il y a toujours des societes qui viennent meme de tres loin pour admirer la beaute du panorama et qui s'en retournent enchantees. Tenez, dimanche prochain, si le temps se maintient, vous trouveriez certainement du monde, comme ce sont les Rogations. Il faut avouer du reste qu'on jouit de la d'un coup d'il feerique, avec des sortes d'echappees sur la plaine qui ont un cachet tout particulier. Quand le temps est clair on peut distinguer jusqu'a Verneuil. Surtout on embrasse a la fois des choses qu'on ne peut voir habituellement que l'une sans l'autre, comme le cours de la Vivonne et les fosses de Saint-Assise-les-Combray, dont elle est separee par un rideau de grands arbres, ou encore comme les differents canaux de Jouy-le-Vicomte (Gaudiacus vice comitis comme vous savez). Chaque fois que je suis alle a Jouy-le-Vicomte, j'ai bien vu un bout du canal, puis quand j'avais tourne une rue j'en voyais un autre, mais alors je ne voyais plus le precedent. J'avais beau les mettre ensemble par la pensee, cela ne me faisait pas grand effet. Du clocher de Saint-Hilaire c'est autre chose, c'est tout un reseau ou la localite est prise. Seulement on ne distingue pas d'eau, on dirait de grandes fentes qui coupent si bien la ville en quartiers, qu'elle est comme une brioche dont les morceaux tiennent ensemble mais sont deja decoupes. Il faudrait pour bien faire etre a la fois dans le clocher de Saint-Hilaire et a Jouy-le-Vicomte. Le cure avait tellement fatigue ma tante qu'a peine etait-il parti, elle etait obligee de renvoyer Eulalie. --Tenez, ma pauvre Eulalie, disait-elle d'une voix faible, en tirant une piece d'une petite bourse qu'elle avait a portee de sa main, voila pour que vous ne m'oubliez pas dans vos prieres. --Ah! mais, madame Octave, je ne sais pas si je dois, vous savez bien que ce n'est pas pour cela que je viens! disait Eulalie avec la meme hesitation et le meme embarras, chaque fois, que si c'etait la premiere, et avec une apparence de mecontentement qui egayait ma tante mais ne lui deplaisait pas, car si un jour Eulalie, en prenant la piece, avait un air un peu moins contrarie que de coutume, ma tante disait: --Je ne sais pas ce qu'avait Eulalie; je lui ai pourtant donne la meme chose que d'habitude, elle n'avait pas l'air contente. --Je crois qu'elle n'a pourtant pas a se plaindre, soupirait Francoise, qui avait une tendance a considerer comme de la menue monnaie tout ce que lui donnait ma tante pour elle ou pour ses enfants, et comme des tresors follement gaspilles pour une ingrate les piecettes mises chaque dimanche dans la main d'Eulalie, mais si discretement que Francoise n'arrivait jamais a les voir. Ce n'est pas que l'argent que ma tante donnait a Eulalie, Francoise l'eut voulu pour elle. Elle jouissait suffisamment de ce que ma tante possedait, sachant que les richesses de la maitresse du meme coup elevent et embellissent aux yeux de tous sa servante; et qu'elle, Francoise, etait insigne et glorifiee dans Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte et autres lieux, pour les nombreuses fermes de ma tante, les visites frequentes et prolongees du cure, le nombre singulier des bouteilles d'eau de Vichy consommees. Elle n'etait avare que pour ma tante; si elle avait gere sa fortune, ce qui eut ete son reve, elle l'aurait preservee des entreprises d'autrui avec une ferocite maternelle. Elle n'aurait pourtant pas trouve grand mal a ce que ma tante, qu'elle savait incurablement genereuse, se fut laissee aller a donner, si au moins c'avait ete a des riches. Peut-etre pensait-elle que ceux-la, n'ayant pas besoin des cadeaux de ma tante, ne pouvaient etre soupconnes de l'aimer a cause d'eux. D'ailleurs offerts a des personnes d'une grande position de fortune, a Mme Sazerat, a M. Swann, a M. Legrandin, a Mme Goupil, a des personnes de meme rang que ma tante et qui allaient bien ensemble, ils lui apparaissaient comme faisant partie des usages de cette vie etrange et brillante des gens riches qui chassent, se donnent des bals, se font des visites et qu'elle admirait en souriant. Mais il n'en allait plus de meme si les beneficiaires de la generosite de ma tante etaient de ceux que Francoise appelait des gens comme moi, des gens qui ne sont pas plus que moi et qui etaient ceux qu'elle meprisait le plus a moins qu'ils ne l'appelassent Madame Francoise et ne se considerassent comme etant moins qu'elle. Et quand elle vit que, malgre ses conseils, ma tante n'en faisait qu'a sa tete et jetait l'argent--Francoise le croyait du moins--pour des creatures indignes, elle commenca a trouver bien petits les dons que ma tante lui faisait en comparaison des sommes imaginaires prodiguees a Eulalie. Il n'y avait pas dans les environs de Combray de ferme si consequente que Francoise ne supposat qu'Eulalie eut pu facilement l'acheter, avec tout ce que lui rapporteraient ses visites. Il est vrai qu'Eulalie faisait la meme estimation des richesses immenses et cachees de Francoise.

"sur son compte. Elle la haissait, mais elle la craignait et se croyait tenue, quand elle etait la, a lui faire bon visage. Elle se rattrapait apres son depart, sans la nommer jamais a vrai dire, mais en proferant des oracles sibyllins, des sentences d'un caractere general telles que celles de l'Ecclesiaste, mais dont l'application ne pouvait echapper a ma tante. Apres avoir regarde par le coin du rideau si Eulalie avait referme la porte: Les personnes flatteuses savent se faire bien venir et ramasser les pepettes; mais patience, le bon Dieu les punit toutes par un beau jour, disait-elle, avec le regard lateral et l'insinuation de Joas pensant exclusivement a Athalie quand il dit: Mais quand le cure etait venu aussi et que sa visite interminable avait epuise les forces de ma tante, Francoise sortait de la chambre derriere Eulalie et disait: --Madame Octave, je vous laisse reposer, vous avez l'air beaucoup fatiguee. Et ma tante ne repondait meme pas, exhalant un soupir qui semblait devoir etre le dernier, les yeux clos, comme morte. Mais a peine Francoise etait-elle descendue que quatre coups donnes avec la plus grande violence retentissaient dans la maison et ma tante, dressee sur son lit, criait: --Est-ce qu'Eulalie est deja partie? Croyez-vous que j'ai oublie de lui demander si Mme Goupil etait arrivee a la messe avant l'elevation! Courez vite apres elle! Mais Francoise revenait n'ayant pu rattraper Eulalie. --C'est contrariant, disait ma tante en hochant la tete. La seule chose importante que j'avais a lui demander! Ainsi passait la vie pour ma tante Leonie, toujours identique, dans la douce uniformite de ce qu'elle appelait avec un dedain affecte et une tendresse profonde, son petit traintrain. Preserve par tout le monde, non seulement a la maison, ou chacun ayant eprouve l'inutilite de lui conseiller une meilleure hygiene, s'etait peu a peu resigne a le respecter, mais meme dans le village ou, a trois rues de nous, l'emballeur, avant de clouer ses caisses, faisait demander a Francoise si ma tante ne reposait pas,--ce traintrain fut pourtant trouble une fois cette annee-la. Comme un fruit cache qui serait parvenu a maturite sans qu'on s'en apercut et se detacherait spontanement, survint une nuit la delivrance de la fille de cuisine. Mais ses douleurs etaient intolerables, et comme il n'y avait pas de sage-femme a Combray, Francoise dut partir avant le jour en chercher une a Thiberzy. Ma tante, a cause des cris de la fille de cuisine, ne put reposer, et Francoise, malgre la courte distance, n'etant revenue que tres tard, lui manqua beaucoup. Aussi, ma mere me dit-elle dans la matinee: Monte donc voir si ta tante n'a besoin de rien. J'entrai dans la premiere piece et, par la porte ouverte, vis ma tante, couchee sur le cote, qui dormait; je l'entendis ronfler legerement. J'allais m'en aller doucement mais sans doute le bruit que j'avais fait etait intervenu dans son sommeil et en avait change la vitesse, comme on dit pour les automobiles, car la musique du ronflement s'interrompit une seconde et reprit un ton plus bas, puis elle s'eveilla et tourna a demi son visage que je pus voir alors; il exprimait une sorte de terreur; elle venait evidemment d'avoir un reve affreux; elle ne pouvait me voir de la facon dont elle etait placee, et je restais la ne sachant si je devais m'avancer ou me retirer; mais deja elle semblait revenue au sentiment de la realite et avait reconnu le mensonge des visions qui l'avaient effrayee; un sourire de joie, de pieuse reconnaissance envers Dieu qui permet que la vie soit moins cruelle que les reves, eclaira faiblement son visage, et avec cette habitude qu'elle avait prise de se parler a mi-voix a elle-meme quand elle se croyait seule, elle murmura: Dieu soit loue! nous n'avons comme tracas que la fille de cuisine qui accouche. Voila-t-il pas que je revais que mon pauvre Octave etait ressuscite et qu'il voulait me faire faire une promenade tous les jours! Sa main se tendit vers son chapelet qui etait sur la petite table, mais le sommeil recommencant ne lui laissa pas la force de l'atteindre: elle se rendormit, tranquillisee, et je sortis a pas de loup de la chambre sans qu'elle ni personne eut jamais appris ce que j'avais entendu. Quand je dis qu'en dehors d'evenements tres rares, comme cet accouchement, le traintrain de ma tante ne subissait jamais aucune variation, je ne parle pas de celles qui, se repetant toujours identiques a des intervalles reguliers, n'introduisaient au sein de l'uniformite qu'une sorte d'uniformite secondaire. C'est ainsi que tous les samedis, comme Francoise allait dans l'apres-midi au marche de Roussainville-le-Pin, le dejeuner etait, pour tout le monde, une heure plus tot. Et ma tante avait si bien pris l'habitude de cette derogation hebdomadaire a ses habitudes, qu'elle tenait a cette habitude-la autant qu'aux autres. Elle y etait si bien routinee, comme disait Francoise, que s'il lui avait fallu un samedi, attendre pour dejeuner l'heure habituelle, cela l'eut autant derangee que si elle avait du, un autre jour, avancer son dejeuner a l'heure du samedi. Cette avance du dejeuner donnait d'ailleurs au samedi, pour nous tous, une figure particuliere, indulgente, et assez sympathique. Au moment ou d'habitude on a encore une heure a vivre avant la detente du repas, on savait que, dans quelques secondes, on allait voir arriver des endives precoces, une omelette de faveur, un bifteck immerite. Le retour de ce samedi asymetrique etait un de ces petits evenements interieurs, locaux, presque civiques qui, dans les vies tranquilles et les societes fermees, creent une sorte de lien national et deviennent le theme favori des conversations, des plaisanteries, des recits exageres a plaisir: il eut ete le noyau tout pret pour un cycle legendaire si l'un de nous avait eu la tete epique. Des le matin, avant d'etre habilles, sans raison, pour le plaisir d'eprouver la force de la solidarite, on se disait les uns aux autres avec bonne humeur, avec cordialite, avec patriotisme: Il n'y a pas de temps a perdre, n'oublions pas que c'est samedi! cependant que ma tante, conferant avec Francoise et songeant que la journee serait plus longue que d'habitude, disait: Si vous leur faisiez un beau morceau de veau, comme c'est samedi. Si a dix heures et demie un distrait tirait sa montre en disant: Allons, encore une heure et demie avant le dejeuner, chacun etait enchante d'avoir a lui dire: Mais voyons, a quoi pensez-vous, vous oubliez que c'est samedi! ; on en riait encore un quart d'heure apres et on se promettait de monter raconter cet oubli a ma tante pour l'amuser. Le visage du ciel meme semblait change. Apres le dejeuner, le soleil, conscient que c'etait samedi, flanait une heure de plus au haut du ciel, et quand quelqu'un, pensant qu'on etait en retard pour la promenade, disait: Comment, seulement deux heures? en voyant passer les deux coups du clocher de Saint-Hilaire (qui ont l'habitude de ne rencontrer encore personne dans les chemins desertes a cause du repas de midi ou de la sieste, le long de la riviere vive et blanche que le pecheur meme a abandonnee, et passent solitaires dans le ciel vacant ou ne restent que quelques nuages paresseux), tout le monde en chur lui repondait: Mais ce qui vous trompe, c'est qu'on a dejeune une heure plus tot, vous savez bien que c'est samedi! La surprise d'un barbare (nous appelions ainsi tous les gens qui ne savaient pas ce qu'avait de particulier le samedi) qui, etant venu a onze heures pour parler a mon pere, nous avait trouves a table, etait une des choses qui, dans sa vie, avaient le plus egaye Francoise. Mais si elle trouvait amusant que le visiteur interloque ne sut pas que nous dejeunions plus tot le samedi, elle trouvait plus comique encore (tout en sympathisant du fond du cur avec ce chauvinisme etroit) que mon pere, lui, n'eut pas eu l'idee que ce barbare pouvait l'ignorer et eut repondu sans autre explication a son etonnement de nous voir deja dans la salle a manger: Mais voyons, c'est samedi! Parvenue a ce point de son recit, elle essuyait des larmes d'hilarite et pour accroitre le plaisir qu'elle eprouvait, elle prolongeait le dialogue, inventait ce qu'avait repondu le visiteur a qui ce samedi n'expliquait rien. Et bien loin de nous plaindre de ses additions, elles ne nous suffisaient pas encore et nous disions: Mais il me semblait qu'il avait dit aussi autre chose. C'etait plus long la premiere fois quand vous l'avez raconte. Ma grand'tante elle-meme laissait son ouvrage, levait la tete et regardait par-dessus son lorgnon. Le samedi avait encore ceci de particulier que ce jour-la, pendant le mois de mai, nous sortions apres le diner pour aller au mois de Marie. Comme nous y rencontrions parfois M. Vinteuil, tres severe pour le genre deplorable des jeunes gens negliges, dans les idees de l'epoque actuelle, ma mere prenait garde que rien ne clochat dans ma tenue, puis on partait pour l'eglise. C'est au mois de Marie que je me souviens d'avoir commence a aimer les aubepines. N'etant pas seulement dans l'eglise, si sainte, mais ou nous avions le droit d'entrer, posees sur l'autel meme, inseparables des mysteres a la celebration desquels elles prenaient part, elles faisaient courir au milieu des flambeaux et des vases sacres leurs branches attachees horizontalement les unes aux autres en un appret de fete, et qu'enjolivaient encore les festons de leur feuillage sur lequel etaient semes a profusion, comme sur une traine de mariee, de petits bouquets de boutons d'une blancheur eclatante. Mais, sans oser les regarder qu'a la derobee, je sentais que ces apprets pompeux etaient vivants et que c'etait la nature elle-meme qui, en creusant ces decoupures dans les feuilles, en ajoutant l'ornement supreme de ces blancs boutons, avait rendu cette decoration digne de ce qui etait a la fois une rejouissance populaire et une solennite mystique. Plus haut s'ouvraient leurs corolles ca et la",4.015127285442584,1.711700101149142,0.326469906470475,0.10570394626224945,4.597599494630448,4.0,2.509196084269059,29.867924528301888,26.0,22.939656472768803,1.2943777637397347,1.0,0.5983869463164895,1583,651,0.41124447252053065,8281,53,26.47511648648439,314772655454.42737,163433362.1258709,0.7153315922388663,0.7174787305149377,67.01469779139207,11.332148178166609,10.191454449994598,13.993916494833073,15.158655883860355,10.242855337965885,51.788328823943075,6.547169811320755,True,66.0,0.8738317757009346,4.299584631360332,1926.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004426114073030882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009656976159340106,0.00362136605975254,0.005733829594608188,0.15005192107995846,25,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"avec une grace insouciante, retenant si negligemment comme un dernier et vaporeux atour le bouquet d'etamines, fines comme des fils de la Vierge, qui les embrumait tout entieres, qu'en suivant, qu'en essayant de mimer au fond de moi le geste de leur efflorescence, je l'imaginais comme si c'avait ete le mouvement de tete etourdi et rapide, au regard coquet, aux pupilles diminuees, d'une blanche jeune fille, distraite et vive. M. Vinteuil etait venu avec sa fille se placer a cote de nous. D'une bonne famille, il avait ete le professeur de piano des surs de ma grand'mere et quand, apres la mort de sa femme et un heritage qu'il avait fait, il s'etait retire aupres de Combray, on le recevait souvent a la maison. Mais d'une pudibonderie excessive, il cessa de venir pour ne pas rencontrer Swann qui avait fait ce qu'il appelait un mariage deplace, dans le gout du jour. Ma mere, ayant appris qu'il composait, lui avait dit par amabilite que, quand elle irait le voir, il faudrait qu'il lui fit entendre quelque chose de lui. M. Vinteuil en aurait eu beaucoup de joie, mais il poussait la politesse et la bonte jusqu'a de tels scrupules que, se mettant toujours a la place des autres, il craignait de les ennuyer et de leur paraitre egoiste s'il suivait ou seulement laissait deviner son desir. Le jour ou mes parents etaient alles chez lui en visite, je les avais accompagnes, mais ils m'avaient permis de rester dehors et, comme la maison de M. Vinteuil, Montjouvain, etait en contre-bas d'un monticule buissonneux, ou je m'etais cache, je m'etais trouve de plain-pied avec le salon du second etage, a cinquante centimetres de la fenetre. Quand on etait venu lui annoncer mes parents, j'avais vu M. Vinteuil se hater de mettre en evidence sur le piano un morceau de musique. Mais une fois mes parents entres, il l'avait retire et mis dans un coin. Sans doute avait-il craint de leur laisser supposer qu'il n'etait heureux de les voir que pour leur jouer de ses compositions. Et chaque fois que ma mere etait revenue a la charge au cours de la visite, il avait repete plusieurs fois Mais je ne sais qui a mis cela sur le piano, ce n'est pas sa place, et avait detourne la conversation sur d'autres sujets, justement parce que ceux-la l'interessaient moins. Sa seule passion etait pour sa fille et celle-ci qui avait l'air d'un garcon paraissait si robuste qu'on ne pouvait s'empecher de sourire en voyant les precautions que son pere prenait pour elle, ayant toujours des chales supplementaires a lui jeter sur les epaules. Ma grand'mere faisait remarquer quelle expression douce delicate, presque timide passait souvent dans les regards de cette enfant si rude, dont le visage etait seme de taches de son. Quand elle venait de prononcer une parole elle l'entendait avec l'esprit de ceux a qui elle l'avait dite, s'alarmait des malentendus possibles et on voyait s'eclairer, se decouper comme par transparence, sous la figure hommasse du bon diable, les traits plus fins d'une jeune fille eploree. Quand, au moment de quitter l'eglise, je m'agenouillai devant l'autel, je sentis tout d'un coup, en me relevant, s'echapper des aubepines une odeur amere et douce d'amandes, et je remarquai alors sur les fleurs de petites places plus blondes, sous lesquelles je me figurai que devait etre cachee cette odeur comme sous les parties gratinees le gout d'une frangipane ou sous leurs taches de rousseur celui des joues de Mlle Vinteuil. Malgre la silencieuse immobilite des aubepines, cette intermittente ardeur etait comme le murmure de leur vie intense dont l'autel vibrait ainsi qu'une haie agreste visitee par de vivantes antennes, auxquelles on pensait en voyant certaines etamines presque rousses qui semblaient avoir garde la virulence printaniere, le pouvoir irritant, d'insectes aujourd'hui metamorphoses en fleurs. Nous causions un moment avec M. Vinteuil devant le porche en sortant de l'eglise. Il intervenait entre les gamins qui se chamaillaient sur la place, prenait la defense des petits, faisait des sermons aux grands. Si sa fille nous disait de sa grosse voix combien elle avait ete contente de nous voir, aussitot il semblait qu'en elle-meme une sur plus sensible rougissait de ce propos de bon garcon etourdi qui avait pu nous faire croire qu'elle sollicitait d'etre invitee chez nous. Son pere lui jetait un manteau sur les epaules, ils montaient dans un petit buggy qu'elle conduisait elle-meme et tous deux retournaient a Montjouvain. Quant a nous, comme c'etait le lendemain dimanche et qu'on ne se leverait que pour la grand'messe, s'il faisait clair de lune et que l'air fut chaud, au lieu de nous faire rentrer directement, mon pere, par amour de la gloire, nous faisait faire par le calvaire une longue promenade, que le peu d'aptitude de ma mere a s'orienter et a se reconnaitre dans son chemin, lui faisait considerer comme la prouesse d'un genie strategique. Parfois nous allions jusqu'au viaduc, dont les enjambees de pierre commencaient a la gare et me representaient l'exil et la detresse hors du monde civilise parce que chaque annee en venant de Paris, on nous recommandait de faire bien attention, quand ce serait Combray, de ne pas laisser passer la station, d'etre prets d'avance car le train repartait au bout de deux minutes et s'engageait sur le viaduc au dela des pays chretiens dont Combray marquait pour moi l'extreme limite. Nous revenions par le boulevard de la gare, ou etaient les plus agreables villas de la commune. Dans chaque jardin le clair de lune, comme Hubert Robert, semait ses degres rompus de marbre blanc, ses jets d'eau, ses grilles entr'ouvertes. Sa lumiere avait detruit le bureau du telegraphe. Il n'en subsistait plus qu'une colonne a demi brisee, mais qui gardait la beaute d'une ruine immortelle. Je trainais la jambe, je tombais de sommeil, l'odeur des tilleuls qui embaumait m'apparaissait comme une recompense qu'on ne pouvait obtenir qu'au prix des plus grandes fatigues et qui n'en valait pas la peine. De grilles fort eloignees les unes des autres, des chiens reveilles par nos pas solitaires faisaient alterner des aboiements comme il m'arrive encore quelquefois d'en entendre le soir, et entre lesquels dut venir (quand sur son emplacement on crea le jardin public de Combray) se refugier le boulevard de la gare, car, ou que je me trouve, des qu'ils commencent a retentir et a se repondre, je l'apercois, avec ses tilleuls et son trottoir eclaire par la lune. Tout d'un coup mon pere nous arretait et demandait a ma mere: Ou sommes-nous? Epuisee par la marche, mais fiere de lui, elle lui avouait tendrement qu'elle n'en savait absolument rien. Il haussait les epaules et riait. Alors, comme s'il l'avait sortie de la poche de son veston avec sa clef, il nous montrait debout devant nous la petite porte de derriere de notre jardin qui etait venue avec le coin de la rue du Saint-Esprit nous attendre au bout de ces chemins inconnus. Ma mere lui disait avec admiration: Tu es extraordinaire! Et a partir de cet instant, je n'avais plus un seul pas a faire, le sol marchait pour moi dans ce jardin ou depuis si longtemps mes actes avaient cesse d'etre accompagnes d'attention volontaire: l'Habitude venait de me prendre dans ses bras et me portait jusqu'a mon lit comme un petit enfant. Si la journee du samedi, qui commencait une heure plus tot, et ou elle etait privee de Francoise, passait plus lentement qu'une autre pour ma tante, elle en attendait pourtant le retour avec impatience depuis le commencement de la semaine, comme contenant toute la nouveaute et la distraction que fut encore capable de supporter son corps affaibli et maniaque. Et ce n'est pas cependant qu'elle n'aspirat parfois a quelque plus grand changement, qu'elle n'eut de ces heures d'exception ou l'on a soif de quelque chose d'autre que ce qui est, et ou ceux que le manque d'energie ou d'imagination empeche de tirer d'eux-memes un principe de renovation, demandent a la minute qui vient, au facteur qui sonne, de leur apporter du nouveau, fut-ce du pire, une emotion, une douleur; ou la sensibilite, que le bonheur a fait taire comme une harpe oisive, veut resonner sous une main, meme brutale, et dut-elle en etre brisee; ou la volonte, qui a si difficilement conquis le droit d'etre livree sans obstacle a ses desirs, a ses peines, voudrait jeter les renes entre les mains d'evenements imperieux, fussent-ils cruels. Sans doute, comme les forces de ma tante, taries a la moindre fatigue, ne lui revenaient que goutte a goutte au sein de son repos, le reservoir etait tres long a remplir, et il se passait des mois avant qu'elle eut ce leger trop-plein que d'autres derivent dans l'activite et dont elle etait incapable de savoir et de decider comment user. Je ne doute pas qu'alors--comme le desir de la remplacer par des pommes de terre bechamel finissait au bout de quelque temps par naitre du plaisir meme que lui causait le retour quotidien de la puree dont elle ne se fatiguait pas,--elle ne tirat de l'accumulation de ces jours monotones auxquels elle tenait tant, l'attente d'un cataclysme domestique limite a la duree d'un moment mais qui la forcerait d'accomplir une fois pour toutes un de ces changements dont elle reconnaissait qu'ils lui seraient salutaires et auxquels elle ne pouvait d'elle-meme se decider. Elle nous aimait veritablement, elle aurait eu plaisir a nous pleurer; survenant a un moment ou elle se sentait bien et n'etait pas en sueur, la nouvelle que la maison etait la proie d'un incendie ou nous avions deja tous peri et qui n'allait plus bientot laisser subsister une seule pierre des murs, mais auquel elle aurait eu tout le temps d'echapper sans se presser, a condition de se lever tout de suite, a du souvent hanter ses esperances comme unissant aux avantages secondaires de lui faire savourer dans un long regret toute sa tendresse pour nous, et d'etre la stupefaction du village en conduisant",4.488939182845552,1.7626203266159515,0.32150551048210635,0.09269545316408531,4.580025608194623,4.0,2.57418694185876,35.5,27.5,25.866352309867388,1.3117797695262483,1.0,0.6295961615659594,1562,675,0.4321382842509603,8228,44,22.826892465186432,8195839342.462785,4378119.306871146,0.7834016604478969,0.7891619169995898,59.82593149807941,13.734001280409732,12.120593745353286,16.991293213828424,17.89192061459667,10.296747759282972,58.09923175416133,8.022727272727273,True,53.0,0.8995726495726496,4.395299145299146,1872.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0048543689320388345,0.0048543689320388345,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006067961165048544,0.003033980582524272,0.0,0.1469017094017094,26,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"notre deuil, courageuse et accablee, moribonde debout, celui bien plus precieux de la forcer au bon moment, sans temps a perdre, sans possibilite d'hesitation enervante, a aller passer l'ete dans sa jolie ferme de Mirougrain, ou il y avait une chute d'eau. Comme n'etait jamais survenu aucun evenement de ce genre, dont elle meditait certainement la reussite quand elle etait seule absorbee dans ses innombrables jeux de patience (et qui l'eut desesperee au premier commencement de realisation, au premier de ces petits faits imprevus, de cette parole annoncant une mauvaise nouvelle et dont on ne peut plus jamais oublier l'accent, de tout ce qui porte l'empreinte de la mort reelle, bien differente de sa possibilite logique et abstraite), elle se rabattait pour rendre de temps en temps sa vie plus interessante, a y introduire des peripeties imaginaires qu'elle suivait avec passion. Elle se plaisait a supposer tout d'un coup que Francoise la volait, qu'elle recourait a la ruse pour s'en assurer, la prenait sur le fait; habituee, quand elle faisait seule des parties de cartes, a jouer a la fois son jeu et le jeu de son adversaire, elle se prononcait a elle-meme les excuses embarrassees de Francoise et y repondait avec tant de feu et d'indignation que l'un de nous, entrant a ces moments-la, la trouvait en nage, les yeux etincelants, ses faux cheveux deplaces laissant voir son front chauve. Francoise entendit peut-etre parfois dans la chambre voisine de mordants sarcasmes qui s'adressaient a elle et dont l'invention n'eut pas soulage suffisamment ma tante, s'ils etaient restes a l'etat purement immateriel, et si en les murmurant a mi-voix elle ne leur eut donne plus de realite. Quelquefois, ce spectacle dans un lit ne suffisait meme pas a ma tante, elle voulait faire jouer ses pieces. Alors, un dimanche, toutes portes mysterieusement fermees, elle confiait a Eulalie ses doutes sur la probite de Francoise, son intention de se defaire d'elle, et une autre fois, a Francoise ses soupcons de l'infidelite d'Eulalie, a qui la porte serait bientot fermee; quelques jours apres elle etait degoutee de sa confidente de la veille et racoquinee avec le traitre, lesquels d'ailleurs, pour la prochaine representation, echangeraient leurs emplois. Mais les soupcons que pouvait parfois lui inspirer Eulalie, n'etaient qu'un feu de paille et tombaient vite, faute d'aliment, Eulalie n'habitant pas la maison. Il n'en etait pas de meme de ceux qui concernaient Francoise, que ma tante sentait perpetuellement sous le meme toit qu'elle, sans que, par crainte de prendre froid si elle sortait de son lit, elle osat descendre a la cuisine se rendre compte s'ils etaient fondes. Peu a peu son esprit n'eut plus d'autre occupation que de chercher a deviner ce qu'a chaque moment pouvait faire, et chercher a lui cacher, Francoise. Elle remarquait les plus furtifs mouvements de physionomie de celle-ci, une contradiction dans ses paroles, un desir qu'elle semblait dissimuler. Et elle lui montrait qu'elle l'avait demasquee, d'un seul mot qui faisait palir Francoise et que ma tante semblait trouver, a enfoncer au cur de la malheureuse, un divertissement cruel. Et le dimanche suivant, une revelation d'Eulalie,--comme ces decouvertes qui ouvrent tout d'un coup un champ insoupconne a une science naissante et qui se trainait dans l'orniere,--prouvait a ma tante qu'elle etait dans ses suppositions bien au-dessous de la verite. Mais Francoise doit le savoir maintenant que vous y avez donne une voiture. --Que je lui ai donne une voiture! s'ecriait ma tante.--Ah! mais je ne sais pas, moi, je croyais, je l'avais vue qui passait maintenant en caleche, fiere comme Artaban, pour aller au marche de Roussainville. J'avais cru que c'etait Mme Octave qui lui avait donne. Peu a peu Francoise et ma tante, comme la bete et le chasseur, ne cessaient plus de tacher de prevenir les ruses l'une de l'autre. Ma mere craignait qu'il ne se developpat chez Francoise une veritable haine pour ma tante qui l'offensait le plus durement qu'elle le pouvait. En tous cas Francoise attachait de plus en plus aux moindres paroles, aux moindres gestes de ma tante une attention extraordinaire. Quand elle avait quelque chose a lui demander, elle hesitait longtemps sur la maniere dont elle devait s'y prendre. Et quand elle avait profere sa requete, elle observait ma tante a la derobee, tachant de deviner dans l'aspect de sa figure ce que celle-ci avait pense et deciderait. Et ainsi--tandis que quelque artiste lisant les Memoires du XVIIe siecle, et desirant de se rapprocher du grand Roi, croit marcher dans cette voie en se fabriquant une genealogie qui le fait descendre d'une famille historique ou en entretenant une correspondance avec un des souverains actuels de l'Europe, tourne precisement le dos a ce qu'il a le tort de chercher sous des formes identiques et par consequent mortes,--une vieille dame de province qui ne faisait qu'obeir sincerement a d'irresistibles manies et a une mechancete nee de l'oisivete, voyait sans avoir jamais pense a Louis XIV les occupations les plus insignifiantes de sa journee, concernant son lever, son dejeuner, son repos, prendre par leur singularite despotique un peu de l'interet de ce que Saint-Simon appelait la mecanique de la vie a Versailles, et pouvait croire aussi que ses silences, une nuance de bonne humeur ou de hauteur dans sa physionomie, etaient de la part de Francoise l'objet d'un commentaire aussi passionne, aussi craintif que l'etaient le silence, la bonne humeur, la hauteur du Roi quand un courtisan, ou meme les plus grands seigneurs, lui avaient remis une supplique, au detour d'une allee, a Versailles. Un dimanche, ou ma tante avait eu la visite simultanee du cure et d'Eulalie, et s'etait ensuite reposee, nous etions tous montes lui dire bonsoir, et maman lui adressait ses condoleances sur la mauvaise chance qui amenait toujours ses visiteurs a la meme heure: --Je sais que les choses se sont encore mal arrangees tantot, Leonie, lui dit-elle avec douceur, vous avez eu tout votre monde a la fois. Ce que ma grand'tante interrompit par: Abondance de biens... car depuis que sa fille etait malade elle croyait devoir la remonter en lui presentant toujours tout par le bon cote. Mais mon pere prenant la parole: --Je veux profiter, dit-il, de ce que toute la famille est reunie pour vous faire un recit sans avoir besoin de le recommencer a chacun. J'ai peur que nous ne soyons faches avec Legrandin: il m'a a peine dit bonjour ce matin. Je ne restai pas pour entendre le recit de mon pere, car j'etais justement avec lui apres la messe quand nous avions rencontre M. Legrandin, et je descendis a la cuisine demander le menu du diner qui tous les jours me distrayait comme les nouvelles qu'on lit dans un journal et m'excitait a la facon d'un programme de fete. Comme M. Legrandin avait passe pres de nous en sortant de l'eglise, marchant a cote d'une chatelaine du voisinage que nous ne connaissions que de vue, mon pere avait fait un salut a la fois amical et reserve, sans que nous nous arretions; M. Legrandin avait a peine repondu, d'un air etonne, comme s'il ne nous reconnaissait pas, et avec cette perspective du regard particuliere aux personnes qui ne veulent pas etre aimables et qui, du fond subitement prolonge de leurs yeux, ont l'air de vous apercevoir comme au bout d'une route interminable et a une si grande distance qu'elles se contentent de vous adresser un signe de tete minuscule pour le proportionner a vos dimensions de marionnette. Or, la dame qu'accompagnait Legrandin etait une personne vertueuse et consideree; il ne pouvait etre question qu'il fut en bonne fortune et gene d'etre surpris, et mon pere se demandait comment il avait pu mecontenter Legrandin. Je regretterais d'autant plus de le savoir fache, dit mon pere, qu'au milieu de tous ces gens endimanches il a, avec son petit veston droit, sa cravate molle, quelque chose de si peu apprete, de si vraiment simple, et un air presque ingenu qui est tout a fait sympathique. Mais le conseil de famille fut unanimement d'avis que mon pere s'etait fait une idee, ou que Legrandin, a ce moment-la, etait absorbe par quelque pensee. D'ailleurs la crainte de mon pere fut dissipee des le lendemain soir. Comme nous revenions d'une grande promenade, nous apercumes pres du Pont-Vieux Legrandin, qui a cause des fetes, restait plusieurs jours a Combray. Il vint a nous la main tendue: Connaissez-vous, monsieur le liseur, me demanda-t-il, ce vers de Paul Desjardins: Les bois sont deja noirs, le ciel est encor bleu. N'est-ce pas la fine notation de cette heure-ci? Vous n'avez peut-etre jamais lu Paul Desjardins. Lisez-le, mon enfant; aujourd'hui il se mue, me dit-on, en frere precheur, mais ce fut longtemps un aquarelliste limpide... Les bois sont deja noirs, le ciel est encor bleu... Que le ciel reste toujours bleu pour vous, mon jeune ami; et meme a l'heure, qui vient pour moi maintenant, ou les bois sont deja noirs, ou la nuit tombe vite, vous vous consolerez comme je fais en regardant du cote du ciel. Il sortit de sa poche une cigarette, resta longtemps les yeux a l'horizon, Adieu, les camarades, nous dit-il tout a coup, et il nous quitta. A cette heure ou je descendais apprendre le menu, le diner etait deja commence, et Francoise, commandant aux forces de la nature devenues ses aides, comme dans les feeries ou les geants se font engager comme cuisiniers, frappait la houille, donnait a la vapeur des pommes de terre a etuver et faisait finir a point par le feu les chefs-d'uvre culinaires d'abord prepares dans des recipients de ceramiste qui allaient des grandes cuves, marmites, chaudrons et poissonnieres, aux terrines pour le gibier, moules a patisserie, et petits pots de creme en passant par une collection complete de casserole de toutes dimensions. Je m'arretais a voir sur la table, ou la fille de cuisine venait de les ecosser, les petits pois alignes et nombres comme des billes vertes dans un jeu; mais mon ravissement etait",3.535845902245955,1.6480658873825564,0.35092231816729474,0.11124243570737688,4.65097300690521,4.0,2.758077902709284,27.94736842105263,23.0,29.300273067784232,1.3314500941619585,1.0,0.6538285289831692,1593,664,0.41682360326428125,8339,57,27.143725583972568,614285465131.3662,320608280.33996147,0.7127264112433684,0.7078020570630377,65.8277430865299,11.020584795321636,10.919512258532583,13.840592063964053,14.449767073049856,10.488587570621466,52.555026927016215,6.87719298245614,True,71.0,0.8810020876826722,4.352296450939457,1916.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011701170117011701,0.009600960096009602,0.009600960096009602,0.009600960096009602,0.009600960096009602,0.009600960096009602,0.0056005600560056,0.0027002700270027003,0.006000600060006,0.14509394572025053,27,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"devant les asperges, trempees d'outremer et de rose et dont l'epi, finement pignoche de mauve et d'azur, se degrade insensiblement jusqu'au pied,--encore souille pourtant du sol de leur plant,--par des irisations qui ne sont pas de la terre. Il me semblait que ces nuances celestes trahissaient les delicieuses creatures qui s'etaient amusees a se metamorphoser en legumes et qui, a travers le deguisement de leur chair comestible et ferme, laissaient apercevoir en ces couleurs naissantes d'aurore, en ces ebauches d'arc-en-ciel, en cette extinction de soirs bleus, cette essence precieuse que je reconnaissais encore quand, toute la nuit qui suivait un diner ou j'en avais mange, elles jouaient, dans leurs farces poetiques et grossieres comme une feerie de Shakespeare, a changer mon pot de chambre en un vase de parfum. La pauvre Charite de Giotto, comme l'appelait Swann, chargee par Francoise de les plumer, les avait pres d'elle dans une corbeille, son air etait douloureux, comme si elle ressentait tous les malheurs de la terre; et les legeres couronnes d'azur qui ceignaient les asperges au-dessus de leurs tuniques de rose etaient finement dessinees, etoile par etoile, comme le sont dans la fresque les fleurs bandees autour du front ou piquees dans la corbeille de la Vertu de Padoue. Et cependant, Francoise tournait a la broche un de ces poulets, comme elle seule savait en rotir, qui avaient porte loin dans Combray l'odeur de ses merites, et qui, pendant qu'elle nous les servait a table, faisaient predominer la douceur dans ma conception speciale de son caractere, l'arome de cette chair qu'elle savait rendre si onctueuse et si tendre n'etant pour moi que le propre parfum d'une de ses vertus. Mais le jour ou, pendant que mon pere consultait le conseil de famille sur la rencontre de Legrandin, je descendis a la cuisine, etait un de ceux ou la Charite de Giotto, tres malade de son accouchement recent, ne pouvait se lever; Francoise, n'etant plus aidee, etait en retard. Quand je fus en bas, elle etait en train, dans l'arriere-cuisine qui donnait sur la basse-cour, de tuer un poulet qui, par sa resistance desesperee et bien naturelle, mais accompagnee par Francoise hors d'elle, tandis qu'elle cherchait a lui fendre le cou sous l'oreille, des cris de sale bete! sale bete!, mettait la sainte douceur et l'onction de notre servante un peu moins en lumiere qu'il n'eut fait, au diner du lendemain, par sa peau brodee d'or comme une chasuble et son jus precieux egoutte d'un ciboire. Quand il fut mort, Francoise recueillit le sang qui coulait sans noyer sa rancune, eut encore un sursaut de colere, et regardant le cadavre de son ennemi, dit une derniere fois: Sale bete! Je remontai tout tremblant; j'aurais voulu qu'on mit Francoise tout de suite a la porte. Mais qui m'eut fait des boules aussi chaudes, du cafe aussi parfume, et meme... ces poulets? Et en realite, ce lache calcul, tout le monde avait eu a le faire comme moi. Car ma tante Leonie savait,--ce que j'ignorais encore,--que Francoise qui, pour sa fille, pour ses neveux, aurait donne sa vie sans une plainte, etait pour d'autres etres d'une durete singuliere. Malgre cela ma tante l'avait gardee, car si elle connaissait sa cruaute, elle appreciait son service. Je m'apercus peu a peu que la douceur, la componction, les vertus de Francoise cachaient des tragedies d'arriere-cuisine, comme l'histoire decouvre que les regnes des Rois et des Reines, qui sont representes les mains jointes dans les vitraux des eglises, furent marques d'incidents sanglants. Je me rendis compte que, en dehors de ceux de sa parente, les humains excitaient d'autant plus sa pitie par leurs malheurs, qu'ils vivaient plus eloignes d'elle. Les torrents de larmes qu'elle versait en lisant le journal sur les infortunes des inconnus se tarissaient vite si elle pouvait se representer la personne qui en etait l'objet d'une facon un peu precise. Une de ces nuits qui suivirent l'accouchement de la fille de cuisine, celle-ci fut prise d'atroces coliques; maman l'entendit se plaindre, se leva et reveilla Francoise qui, insensible, declara que tous ces cris etaient une comedie, qu'elle voulait faire la maitresse. Le medecin, qui craignait ces crises, avait mis un signet, dans un livre de medecine que nous avions, a la page ou elles sont decrites et ou il nous avait dit de nous reporter pour trouver l'indication des premiers soins a donner. Ma mere envoya Francoise chercher le livre en lui recommandant de ne pas laisser tomber le signet. Au bout d'une heure, Francoise n'etait pas revenue; ma mere indignee crut qu'elle s'etait recouchee et me dit d'aller voir moi-meme dans la bibliotheque. J'y trouvai Francoise qui, ayant voulu regarder ce que le signet marquait, lisait la description clinique de la crise et poussait des sanglots maintenant qu'il s'agissait d'une malade-type qu'elle ne connaissait pas. A chaque symptome douloureux mentionne par l'auteur du traite, elle s'ecriait: He la! Sainte Vierge, est-il possible que le bon Dieu veuille faire souffrir ainsi une malheureuse creature humaine? He! la pauvre! Mais des que je l'eus appelee et qu'elle fut revenue pres du lit de la Charite de Giotto, ses larmes cesserent aussitot de couler; elle ne put reconnaitre ni cette agreable sensation de pitie et d'attendrissement qu'elle connaissait bien et que la lecture des journaux lui avait souvent donnee, ni aucun plaisir de meme famille, dans l'ennui et dans l'irritation de s'etre levee au milieu de la nuit pour la fille de cuisine; et a la vue des memes souffrances dont la description l'avait fait pleurer, elle n'eut plus que des ronchonnements de mauvaise humeur, meme d'affreux sarcasmes, disant, quand elle crut que nous etions partis et ne pouvions plus l'entendre: Elle n'avait qu'a ne pas faire ce qu'il faut pour ca! ca lui a fait plaisir! qu'elle ne fasse pas de manieres maintenant. Faut-il tout de meme qu'un garcon ait ete abandonne du bon Dieu pour aller avec ca. Ah! c'est bien comme on disait dans le patois de ma pauvre mere: Qui du cul d'un chien s'amourose Il lui parait une rose. Si, quand son petit-fils etait un peu enrhume du cerveau, elle partait la nuit, meme malade, au lieu de se coucher, pour voir s'il n'avait besoin de rien, faisant quatre lieues a pied avant le jour afin d'etre rentree pour son travail, en revanche ce meme amour des siens et son desir d'assurer la grandeur future de sa maison se traduisait dans sa politique a l'egard des autres domestiques par une maxime constante qui fut de n'en jamais laisser un seul s'implanter chez ma tante, qu'elle mettait d'ailleurs une sorte d'orgueil a ne laisser approcher par personne, preferant, quand elle-meme etait malade, se relever pour lui donner son eau de Vichy plutot que de permettre l'acces de la chambre de sa maitresse a la fille de cuisine. Et comme cet hymenoptere observe par Fabre, la guepe fouisseuse, qui pour que ses petits apres sa mort aient de la viande fraiche a manger, appelle l'anatomie au secours de sa cruaute et, ayant capture des charancons et des araignees, leur perce avec un savoir et une adresse merveilleux le centre nerveux d'ou depend le mouvement des pattes, mais non les autres fonctions de la vie, de facon que l'insecte paralyse pres duquel elle depose ses ufs, fournisse aux larves, quand elles ecloront un gibier docile, inoffensif, incapable de fuite ou de resistance, mais nullement faisande, Francoise trouvait pour servir sa volonte permanente de rendre la maison intenable a tout domestique, des ruses si savantes et si impitoyables que, bien des annees plus tard, nous apprimes que si cet ete-la nous avions mange presque tous les jours des asperges, c'etait parce que leur odeur donnait a la pauvre fille de cuisine chargee de les eplucher des crises d'asthme d'une telle violence qu'elle fut obligee de finir par s'en aller. Helas! nous devions definitivement changer d'opinion sur Legrandin. Un des dimanches qui suivit la rencontre sur le Pont-Vieux apres laquelle mon pere avait du confesser son erreur, comme la messe finissait et qu'avec le soleil et le bruit du dehors quelque chose de si peu sacre entrait dans l'eglise que Mme Goupil, Mme Percepied (toutes les personnes qui tout a l'heure, a mon arrivee un peu en retard, etaient restees les yeux absorbes dans leur priere et que j'aurais meme pu croire ne m'avoir pas vu entrer si, en meme temps, leurs pieds n'avaient repousse legerement le petit banc qui m'empechait de gagner ma chaise) commencaient a s'entretenir avec nous a haute voix de sujets tout temporels comme si nous etions deja sur la place, nous vimes sur le seuil brulant du porche, dominant le tumulte bariole du marche, Legrandin, que le mari de cette dame avec qui nous l'avions dernierement rencontre, etait en train de presenter a la femme d'un autre gros proprietaire terrien des environs. La figure de Legrandin exprimait une animation, un zele extraordinaires; il fit un profond salut avec un renversement secondaire en arriere, qui ramena brusquement son dos au dela de la position de depart et qu'avait du lui apprendre le mari de sa sur, Mme de Cambremer. Ce redressement rapide fit refluer en une sorte d'onde fougueuse et musclee la croupe de Legrandin que je ne supposais pas si charnue; et je ne sais pourquoi cette ondulation de pure matiere, ce flot tout charnel, sans expression de spiritualite et qu'un empressement plein de bassesse fouettait en tempete, eveillerent tout d'un coup dans mon esprit la possibilite d'un Legrandin tout different de celui que nous connaissions. Cette dame le pria de dire quelque chose a son cocher, et tandis qu'il allait jusqu'a la voiture, l'empreinte de joie timide et devouee que la presentation avait marquee sur son visage y persistait encore. Ravi dans une sorte de reve, il souriait, puis il revint vers la dame en se hatant et, comme il marchait plus vite qu'il n'en avait l'habitude, ses deux epaules oscillaient de droite et de gauche ridiculement, et il avait l'air tant il",4.090990821568242,1.6364764873247928,0.3207793743356998,0.07534841713804638,4.650385604113111,4.0,2.6274468053725997,33.82608695652174,22.0,29.682599461217123,1.3091259640102828,1.0,0.6242272401715121,1556,679,0.43637532133676094,8325,46,22.477587740774734,5779527337.539692,3062812.57951229,0.7553043246683148,0.72912608476525,61.749465183860536,13.049860288364815,11.552084857699999,16.101128870012296,17.38635967363362,10.669203084832901,57.60500726500503,8.043478260869565,True,41.0,0.8892421833598304,4.411764705882353,1887.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004206309464196294,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005508262393590386,0.006409614421632449,0.005408112168252379,0.17859035506094328,28,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"l'eau le traversait tout entier. Alors, en arrivant pres de la maison, nous apercevions une forme sur le pas de la porte et maman me disait: --Mon dieu! voila Francoise qui nous guette, ta tante est inquiete; aussi nous rentrons trop tard. Et sans avoir pris le temps d'enlever nos affaires, nous montions vite chez ma tante Leonie pour la rassurer et lui montrer que, contrairement a ce qu'elle imaginait deja, il ne nous etait rien arrive, mais que nous etions alles du cote de Guermantes et, dame, quand on faisait cette promenade-la, ma tante savait pourtant bien qu'on ne pouvait jamais etre sur de l'heure a laquelle on serait rentre. --La, Francoise, disait ma tante, quand je vous le disais, qu'ils seraient alles du cote de Guermantes! Mon dieu! ils doivent avoir une faim! et votre gigot qui doit etre tout desseche apres ce qu'il a attendu. Aussi est-ce une heure pour rentrer! comment, vous etes alles du cote de Guermantes! --Mais je croyais que vous le saviez, Leonie, disait maman. Je pensais que Francoise nous avait vus sortir par la petite porte du potager. Car il y avait autour de Combray deux cotes pour les promenades, et si opposes qu'on ne sortait pas en effet de chez nous par la meme porte, quand on voulait aller d'un cote ou de l'autre: le cote de Meseglise-la-Vineuse, qu'on appelait aussi le cote de chez Swann parce qu'on passait devant la propriete de M. Swann pour aller par la, et le cote de Guermantes. De Meseglise-la-Vineuse, a vrai dire, je n'ai jamais connu que le cote et des gens etrangers qui venaient le dimanche se promener a Combray, des gens que, cette fois, ma tante elle-meme et nous tous ne connaissions point et qu'a ce signe on tenait pour des gens qui seront venus de Meseglise. Quant a Guermantes je devais un jour en connaitre davantage, mais bien plus tard seulement; et pendant toute mon adolescence, si Meseglise etait pour moi quelque chose d'inaccessible comme l'horizon, derobe a la vue, si loin qu'on allat, par les plis d'un terrain qui ne ressemblait deja plus a celui de Combray, Guermantes lui ne m'est apparu que comme le terme plutot ideal que reel de son propre cote, une sorte d'expression geographique abstraite comme la ligne de l'equateur, comme le pole, comme l'orient. Alors, prendre par Guermantes pour aller a Meseglise, ou le contraire, m'eut semble une expression aussi denuee de sens que prendre par l'est pour aller a l'ouest. Comme mon pere parlait toujours du cote de Meseglise comme de la plus belle vue de plaine qu'il connut et du cote de Guermantes comme du type de paysage de riviere, je leur donnais, en les concevant ainsi comme deux entites, cette cohesion, cette unite qui n'appartiennent qu'aux creations de notre esprit; la moindre parcelle de chacun d'eux me semblait precieuse et manifester leur excellence particuliere, tandis qu'a cote d'eux, avant qu'on fut arrive sur le sol sacre de l'un ou de l'autre, les chemins purement materiels au milieu desquels ils etaient poses comme l'ideal de la vue de plaine et l'ideal du paysage de riviere, ne valaient pas plus la peine d'etre regardes que par le spectateur epris d'art dramatique, les petites rues qui avoisinent un theatre. Mais surtout je mettais entre eux, bien plus que leurs distances kilometriques la distance qu'il y avait entre les deux parties de mon cerveau ou je pensais a eux, une de ces distances dans l'esprit qui ne font pas qu'eloigner, qui separent et mettent dans un autre plan. Et cette demarcation etait rendue plus absolue encore parce que cette habitude que nous avions de n'aller jamais vers les deux cotes un meme jour, dans une seule promenade, mais une fois du cote de Meseglise, une fois du cote de Guermantes, les enfermait pour ainsi dire loin l'un de l'autre, inconnaissables l'un a l'autre, dans les vases clos et sans communication entre eux, d'apres-midi differents. Quand on voulait aller du cote de Meseglise, on sortait (pas trop tot et meme si le ciel etait couvert, parce que la promenade n'etait pas bien longue et n'entrainait pas trop) comme pour aller n'importe ou, par la grande porte de la maison de ma tante sur la rue du Saint-Esprit. On etait salue par l'armurier, on jetait ses lettres a la boite, on disait en passant a Theodore, de la part de Francoise, qu'elle n'avait plus d'huile ou de cafe, et l'on sortait de la ville par le chemin qui passait le long de la barriere blanche du parc de M. Swann. Avant d'y arriver, nous rencontrions, venue au-devant des etrangers, l'odeur de ses lilas. Eux-memes, d'entre les petits curs verts et frais de leurs feuilles, levaient curieusement au-dessus de la barriere du parc leurs panaches de plumes mauves ou blanches que lustrait, meme a l'ombre, le soleil ou elles avaient baigne. Quelques-uns, a demi caches par la petite maison en tuiles appelee maison des Archers, ou logeait le gardien, depassaient son pignon gothique de leur rose minaret. Les Nymphes du printemps eussent semble vulgaires, aupres de ces jeunes houris qui gardaient dans ce jardin francais les tons vifs et purs des miniatures de la Perse. Malgre mon desir d'enlacer leur taille souple et d'attirer a moi les boucles etoilees de leur tete odorante, nous passions sans nous arreter, mes parents n'allant plus a Tansonville depuis le mariage de Swann, et, pour ne pas avoir l'air de regarder dans le parc, au lieu de prendre le chemin qui longe sa cloture et qui monte directement aux champs, nous en prenions un autre qui y conduit aussi, mais obliquement, et nous faisait deboucher trop loin. Un jour, mon grand-pere dit a mon pere: --Vous rappelez-vous que Swann a dit hier que, comme sa femme et sa fille partaient pour Reims, il en profiterait pour aller passer vingt-quatre heures a Paris? Nous pourrions longer le parc, puisque ces dames ne sont pas la, cela nous abregerait d'autant. Nous nous arretames un moment devant la barriere. Le temps des lilas approchait de sa fin; quelques-uns effusaient encore en hauts lustres mauves les bulles delicates de leurs fleurs, mais dans bien des parties du feuillage ou deferlait, il y avait seulement une semaine, leur mousse embaumee, se fletrissait, diminuee et noircie, une ecume creuse, seche et sans parfum. Mon grand-pere montrait a mon pere en quoi l'aspect des lieux etait reste le meme, et en quoi il avait change, depuis la promenade qu'il avait faite avec M. Swann le jour de la mort de sa femme, et il saisit cette occasion pour raconter cette promenade une fois de plus. Devant nous, une allee bordee de capucines montait en plein soleil vers le chateau. A droite, au contraire, le parc s'etendait en terrain plat. Obscurcie par l'ombre des grands arbres qui l'entouraient, une piece d'eau avait ete creusee par les parents de Swann; mais dans ses creations les plus factices, c'est sur la nature que l'homme travaille; certains lieux font toujours regner autour d'eux leur empire particulier, arborent leurs insignes immemoriaux au milieu d'un parc comme ils auraient fait loin de toute intervention humaine, dans une solitude qui revient partout les entourer, surgie des necessites de leur exposition et superposee a l'uvre humaine. C'est ainsi qu'au pied de l'allee qui dominait l'etang artificiel, s'etait composee sur deux rangs, tresses de fleurs de myosotis et de pervenches, la couronne naturelle, delicate et bleue qui ceint le front clair-obscur des eaux, et que le glaieul, laissant flechir ses glaives avec un abandon royal, etendait sur l'eupatoire et la grenouillette au pied mouille, les fleurs de lis en lambeaux, violettes et jaunes, de son sceptre lacustre. Le depart de Mlle Swann qui,--en m'otant la chance terrible de la voir apparaitre dans une allee, d'etre connu et meprise par la petite fille privilegiee qui avait Bergotte pour ami et allait avec lui visiter des cathedrales--, me rendait la contemplation de Tansonville indifferente la premiere fois ou elle m'etait permise, semblait au contraire ajouter a cette propriete, aux yeux de mon grand-pere et de mon pere, des commodites, un agrement passager, et, comme fait pour une excursion en pays de montagnes, l'absence de tout nuage, rendre cette journee exceptionnellement propice a une promenade de ce cote; j'aurais voulu que leurs calculs fussent dejoues, qu'un miracle fit apparaitre Mlle Swann avec son pere, si pres de nous, que nous n'aurions pas le temps de l'eviter et serions obliges de faire sa connaissance. Aussi, quand tout d'un coup, j'apercus sur l'herbe, comme un signe de sa presence possible, un koufin oublie a cote d'une ligne dont le bouchon flottait sur l'eau, je m'empressai de detourner d'un autre cote, les regards de mon pere et de mon grand-pere. D'ailleurs Swann nous ayant dit que c'etait mal a lui de s'absenter, car il avait pour le moment de la famille a demeure, la ligne pouvait appartenir a quelque invite. On n'entendait aucun bruit de pas dans les allees. Divisant la hauteur d'un arbre incertain, un invisible oiseau s'ingeniait a faire trouver la journee courte, explorait d'une note prolongee, la solitude environnante, mais il recevait d'elle une replique si unanime, un choc en retour si redouble de silence et d'immobilite qu'on aurait dit qu'il venait d'arreter pour toujours l'instant qu'il avait cherche a faire passer plus vite. La lumiere tombait si implacable du ciel devenu fixe que l'on aurait voulu se soustraire a son attention, et l'eau dormante elle-meme, dont des insectes irritaient perpetuellement le sommeil, revant sans doute de quelque Maelstrom imaginaire, augmentait le trouble ou m'avait jete la vue du flotteur de liege en semblant l'entrainer a toute vitesse sur les etendues silencieuses du ciel reflete; presque vertical il paraissait pret a plonger et deja je me demandais, si, sans tenir compte du desir et de la crainte que j'avais de la connaitre, je n'avais pas le devoir de faire prevenir Mlle Swann que le poisson mordait,--quand il me fallut rejoindre en courant mon",3.7176529330138814,1.7085140342480314,0.34578579879107885,0.10730465013403422,4.598470363288719,4.0,2.546825506118972,29.055555555555557,18.5,24.422528053893394,1.3046526449968132,1.0,0.627790664941417,1569,629,0.4008922880815806,8240,54,25.24584514743407,92072776245.8666,48205642.01354272,0.749531917379431,0.7069543569098011,66.96999734438074,11.136567877629066,10.941936623858911,14.197110686212026,14.756573188867641,10.220267686424474,51.49022732101126,6.518518518518518,True,54.0,0.8821989528795812,4.31413612565445,1910.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023232323232323233,0.009898989898989899,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007575757575757576,0.00808080808080808,0.010606060606060607,0.1382198952879581,31,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"s'y abandonnait entierement en n'ayant plus souci du reste, d'etre le jouet inerte et mecanique du bonheur. Cependant, nous sortions du porche, nous allions passer a cote de lui, il etait trop bien eleve pour detourner la tete, mais il fixa de son regard soudain charge d'une reverie profonde un point si eloigne de l'horizon qu'il ne put nous voir et n'eut pas a nous saluer. Son visage restait ingenu au-dessus d'un veston souple et droit qui avait l'air de se sentir fourvoye malgre lui au milieu d'un luxe deteste. Et une lavalliere a pois qu'agitait le vent de la Place continuait a flotter sur Legrandin comme l'etendard de son fier isolement et de sa noble independance. Au moment ou nous arrivions a la maison, maman s'apercut qu'on avait oublie le Saint-Honore et demanda a mon pere de retourner avec moi sur nos pas dire qu'on l'apportat tout de suite. Nous croisames pres de l'eglise Legrandin qui venait en sens inverse conduisant la meme dame a sa voiture. Il passa contre nous, ne s'interrompit pas de parler a sa voisine et nous fit du coin de son il bleu un petit signe en quelque sorte interieur aux paupieres et qui, n'interessant pas les muscles de son visage, put passer parfaitement inapercu de son interlocutrice; mais, cherchant a compenser par l'intensite du sentiment le champ un peu etroit ou il en circonscrivait l'expression, dans ce coin d'azur qui nous etait affecte il fit petiller tout l'entrain de la bonne grace qui depassa l'enjouement, frisa la malice; il subtilisa les finesses de l'amabilite jusqu'aux clignements de la connivence, aux demi-mots, aux sous-entendus, aux mysteres de la complicite; et finalement exalta les assurances d'amitie jusqu'aux protestations de tendresse, jusqu'a la declaration d'amour, illuminant alors pour nous seuls d'une langueur secrete et invisible a la chatelaine, une prunelle enamouree dans un visage de glace. Il avait precisement demande la veille a mes parents de m'envoyer diner ce soir-la avec lui: Venez tenir compagnie a votre vieil ami, m'avait-il dit. Comme le bouquet qu'un voyageur nous envoie d'un pays ou nous ne retournerons plus, faites-moi respirer du lointain de votre adolescence ces fleurs des printemps que j'ai traverses moi aussi il y a bien des annees. Venez avec la primevere, la barbe de chanoine, le bassin d'or, venez avec le sedum dont est fait le bouquet de dilection de la flore balzacienne, avec la fleur du jour de la Resurrection, la paquerette et la boule de neige des jardins qui commence a embaumer dans les allees de votre grand'tante quand ne sont pas encore fondues les dernieres boules de neige des giboulees de Paques. Venez avec la glorieuse veture de soie du lis digne de Salomon, et l'email polychrome des pensees, mais venez surtout avec la brise fraiche encore des dernieres gelees et qui va entr'ouvrir, pour les deux papillons qui depuis ce matin attendent a la porte, la premiere rose de Jerusalem. On se demandait a la maison si on devait m'envoyer tout de meme diner avec M. Legrandin. Mais ma grand'mere refusa de croire qu'il eut ete impoli. Vous reconnaissez vous-meme qu'il vient la avec sa tenue toute simple qui n'est guere celle d'un mondain. Elle declarait qu'en tous cas, et a tout mettre au pis, s'il l'avait ete, mieux valait ne pas avoir l'air de s'en etre apercu. A vrai dire mon pere lui-meme, qui etait pourtant le plus irrite contre l'attitude qu'avait eue Legrandin, gardait peut-etre un dernier doute sur le sens qu'elle comportait. Elle etait comme toute attitude ou action ou se revele le caractere profond et cache de quelqu'un: elle ne se relie pas a ses paroles anterieures, nous ne pouvons pas la faire confirmer par le temoignage du coupable qui n'avouera pas; nous en sommes reduits a celui de nos sens dont nous nous demandons, devant ce souvenir isole et incoherent, s'ils n'ont pas ete le jouet d'une illusion; de sorte que de telles attitudes, les seules qui aient de l'importance, nous laissent souvent quelques doutes. Je dinai avec Legrandin sur sa terrasse; il faisait clair de lune: Il y a une jolie qualite de silence, n'est-ce pas, me dit-il; aux curs blesses comme l'est le mien, un romancier que vous lirez plus tard, pretend que conviennent seulement l'ombre et le silence. Et voyez-vous, mon enfant, il vient dans la vie une heure dont vous etes bien loin encore ou les yeux las ne tolerent plus qu'une lumiere, celle qu'une belle nuit comme celle-ci prepare et distille avec l'obscurite, ou les oreilles ne peuvent plus ecouter de musique que celle que joue le clair de lune sur la flute du silence. J'ecoutais les paroles de M. Legrandin qui me paraissaient toujours si agreables; mais trouble par le souvenir d'une femme que j'avais apercue dernierement pour la premiere fois, et pensant, maintenant que je savais que Legrandin etait lie avec plusieurs personnalites aristocratiques des environs, que peut-etre il connaissait celle-ci, prenant mon courage, je lui dis: Est-ce que vous connaissez, monsieur, la... les chatelaines de Guermantes, heureux aussi en prononcant ce nom de prendre sur lui une sorte de pouvoir, par le seul fait de le tirer de mon reve et de lui donner une existence objective et sonore. Mais a ce nom de Guermantes, je vis au milieu des yeux bleus de notre ami se ficher une petite encoche brune comme s'ils venaient d'etre perces par une pointe invisible, tandis que le reste de la prunelle reagissait en secretant des flots d'azur. Le cerne de sa paupiere noircit, s'abaissa. Et sa bouche marquee d'un pli amer se ressaisissant plus vite sourit, tandis que le regard restait douloureux, comme celui d'un beau martyr dont le corps est herisse de fleches: Non, je ne les connais pas, dit-il, mais au lieu de donner a un renseignement aussi simple, a une reponse aussi peu surprenante le ton naturel et courant qui convenait, il le debita en appuyant sur les mots, en s'inclinant, en saluant de la tete, a la fois avec l'insistance qu'on apporte, pour etre cru, a une affirmation invraisemblable,--comme si ce fait qu'il ne connut pas les Guermantes ne pouvait etre l'effet que d'un hasard singulier--et aussi avec l'emphase de quelqu'un qui, ne pouvant pas taire une situation qui lui est penible, prefere la proclamer pour donner aux autres l'idee que l'aveu qu'il fait ne lui cause aucun embarras, est facile, agreable, spontane, que la situation elle-meme--l'absence de relations avec les Guermantes,--pourrait bien avoir ete non pas subie, mais voulue par lui, resulter de quelque tradition de famille, principe de morale ou vu mystique lui interdisant nommement la frequentation des Guermantes. Non, reprit-il, expliquant par ses paroles sa propre intonation, non, je ne les connais pas, je n'ai jamais voulu, j'ai toujours tenu a sauvegarder ma pleine independance; au fond je suis une tete jacobine, vous le savez. Beaucoup de gens sont venus a la rescousse, on me disait que j'avais tort de ne pas aller a Guermantes, que je me donnais l'air d'un malotru, d'un vieil ours. Mais voila une reputation qui n'est pas pour m'effrayer, elle est si vraie! Au fond, je n'aime plus au monde que quelques eglises, deux ou trois livres, a peine davantage de tableaux, et le clair de lune quand la brise de votre jeunesse apporte jusqu'a moi l'odeur des parterres que mes vieilles prunelles ne distinguent plus. Je ne comprenais pas bien que pour ne pas aller chez des gens qu'on ne connait pas, il fut necessaire de tenir a son independance, et en quoi cela pouvait vous donner l'air d'un sauvage ou d'un ours. Mais ce que je comprenais c'est que Legrandin n'etait pas tout a fait veridique quand il disait n'aimer que les eglises, le clair de lune et la jeunesse; il aimait beaucoup les gens des chateaux et se trouvait pris devant eux d'une si grande peur de leur deplaire qu'il n'osait pas leur laisser voir qu'il avait pour amis des bourgeois, des fils de notaires ou d'agents de change, preferant, si la verite devait se decouvrir, que ce fut en son absence, loin de lui et par defaut; il etait snob. Sans doute il ne disait jamais rien de tout cela dans le langage que mes parents et moi-meme nous aimions tant. Et si je demandais: Connaissez-vous les Guermantes? , Legrandin le causeur repondait: Non, je n'ai jamais voulu les connaitre. Malheureusement il ne le repondait qu'en second, car un autre Legrandin qu'il cachait soigneusement au fond de lui, qu'il ne montrait pas, parce que ce Legrandin-la savait sur le notre, sur son snobisme, des histoires compromettantes, un autre Legrandin avait deja repondu par la blessure du regard, par le rictus de la bouche, par la gravite excessive du ton de la reponse, par les mille fleches dont notre Legrandin s'etait trouve en un instant larde et alangui, comme un saint Sebastien du snobisme: Helas! que vous me faites mal, non je ne connais pas les Guermantes, ne reveillez pas la grande douleur de ma vie. Et comme ce Legrandin enfant terrible, ce Legrandin maitre chanteur, s'il n'avait pas le joli langage de l'autre, avait le verbe infiniment plus prompt, compose de ce qu'on appelle reflexes, quand Legrandin le causeur voulait lui imposer silence, l'autre avait deja parle et notre ami avait beau se desoler de la mauvaise impression que les revelations de son alter ego avaient du produire, il ne pouvait qu'entreprendre de la pallier. Et certes cela ne veut pas dire que M. Legrandin ne fut pas sincere quand il tonnait contre les snobs. Il ne pouvait pas savoir, au moins par lui-meme, qu'il le fut, puisque nous ne connaissons jamais que les passions des autres, et que ce que nous arrivons a savoir des notres, ce n'est que d'eux que nous avons pu l'apprendre. Sur nous, elles n'agissent que d'une facon seconde, par l'imagination qui substitue aux premiers mobiles des mobiles de relais qui sont plus decents. Jamais le snobisme de Legrandin ne lui conseillait d'aller",4.283971064183793,1.777435096458897,0.30927586036969834,0.09905260871784882,4.5230473751600515,4.0,2.680568658315346,33.234042553191486,24.0,29.245267131883246,1.3341869398207427,1.0,0.6730377260410461,1562,629,0.4026888604353393,8167,47,23.228724210532427,12249172376.25103,6426638.182713027,0.7506503122656242,0.7614720943901274,60.23023169967583,13.114682485629444,11.90835161595054,16.13612662434958,16.49057441359958,9.904865556978233,55.513171874574326,7.404255319148936,True,50.0,0.8871983210912907,4.284889821615949,1906.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009260201485702656,0.0048845018825684336,0.0048845018825684336,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006105627353210542,0.005291543706115803,0.0048845018825684336,0.1322140608604407,29,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"voir souvent une duchesse. Il chargeait l'imagination de Legrandin de lui faire apparaitre cette duchesse comme paree de toutes les graces. Legrandin se rapprochait de la duchesse, s'estimant de ceder a cet attrait de l'esprit et de la vertu qu'ignorent les infames snobs. Seuls les autres savaient qu'il en etait un; car, grace a l'incapacite ou ils etaient de comprendre le travail intermediaire de son imagination, ils voyaient en face l'une de l'autre l'activite mondaine de Legrandin et sa cause premiere. Maintenant, a la maison, on n'avait plus aucune illusion sur M. Legrandin, et nos relations avec lui s'etaient fort espacees. Maman s'amusait infiniment chaque fois qu'elle prenait Legrandin en flagrant delit du peche qu'il n'avouait pas, qu'il continuait a appeler le peche sans remission, le snobisme. Mon pere, lui, avait de la peine a prendre les dedains de Legrandin avec tant de detachement et de gaite; et quand on pensa une annee a m'envoyer passer les grandes vacances a Balbec avec ma grand'mere, il dit: Il faut absolument que j'annonce a Legrandin que vous irez a Balbec, pour voir s'il vous offrira de vous mettre en rapport avec sa sur. Il ne doit pas se souvenir nous avoir dit qu'elle demeurait a deux kilometres de la. Ma grand'mere qui trouvait qu'aux bains de mer il faut etre du matin au soir sur la plage a humer le sel et qu'on n'y doit connaitre personne, parce que les visites, les promenades sont autant de pris sur l'air marin, demandait au contraire qu'on ne parlat pas de nos projets a Legrandin, voyant deja sa sur, Mme de Cambremer, debarquant a l'hotel au moment ou nous serions sur le point d'aller a la peche et nous forcant a rester enfermes pour la recevoir. Mais maman riait de ses craintes, pensant a part elle que le danger n'etait pas si menacant, que Legrandin ne serait pas si presse de nous mettre en relations avec sa sur. Or, sans qu'on eut besoin de lui parler de Balbec, ce fut lui-meme, Legrandin, qui, ne se doutant pas que nous eussions jamais l'intention d'aller de ce cote, vint se mettre dans le piege un soir ou nous le rencontrames au bord de la Vivonne. --Il y a dans les nuages ce soir des violets et des bleus bien beaux, n'est-ce pas, mon compagnon, dit-il a mon pere, un bleu surtout plus floral qu'aerien, un bleu de cineraire, qui surprend dans le ciel. Et ce petit nuage rose n'a-t-il pas aussi un teint de fleur, d'illet ou d'hydrangea? Il n'y a guere que dans la Manche, entre Normandie et Bretagne, que j'ai pu faire de plus riches observations sur cette sorte de regne vegetal de l'atmosphere. La-bas, pres de Balbec, pres de ces lieux sauvages, il y a une petite baie d'une douceur charmante ou le coucher de soleil du pays d'Auge, le coucher de soleil rouge et or que je suis loin de dedaigner, d'ailleurs, est sans caractere, insignifiant; mais dans cette atmosphere humide et douce s'epanouissent le soir en quelques instants de ces bouquets celestes, bleus et roses, qui sont incomparables et qui mettent souvent des heures a se faner. D'autres s'effeuillent tout de suite et c'est alors plus beau encore de voir le ciel entier que jonche la dispersion d'innombrables petales soufres ou roses. Dans cette baie, dite d'opale, les plages d'or semblent plus douces encore pour etre attachees comme de blondes Andromedes a ces terribles rochers des cotes voisines, a ce rivage funebre, fameux par tant de naufrages, ou tous les hivers bien des barques trepassent au peril de la mer. Balbec! la plus antique ossature geologique de notre sol, vraiment Ar-mor, la Mer, la fin de la terre, la region maudite qu'Anatole France,--un enchanteur que devrait lire notre petit ami--a si bien peinte, sous ses brouillards eternels, comme le veritable pays des Cimmeriens, dans l'Odyssee. De Balbec surtout, ou deja des hotels se construisent, superposes au sol antique et charmant qu'ils n'alterent pas, quel delice d'excursionner a deux pas dans ces regions primitives et si belles. --Ah! est-ce que vous connaissez quelqu'un a Balbec? dit mon pere. Justement ce petit-la doit y aller passer deux mois avec sa grand'mere et peut-etre avec ma femme. Legrandin pris au depourvu par cette question a un moment ou ses yeux etaient fixes sur mon pere, ne put les detourner, mais les attachant de seconde en seconde avec plus d'intensite--et tout en souriant tristement--sur les yeux de son interlocuteur, avec un air d'amitie et de franchise et de ne pas craindre de le regarder en face, il sembla lui avoir traverse la figure comme si elle fut devenue transparente, et voir en ce moment bien au dela derriere elle un nuage vivement colore qui lui creait un alibi mental et qui lui permettrait d'etablir qu'au moment ou on lui avait demande s'il connaissait quelqu'un a Balbec, il pensait a autre chose et n'avait pas entendu la question. Habituellement de tels regards font dire a l'interlocuteur: A quoi pensez-vous donc? Mais mon pere curieux, irrite et cruel, reprit: --Est-ce que vous avez des amis de ce cote-la, que vous connaissez si bien Balbec? Dans un dernier effort desespere, le regard souriant de Legrandin atteignit son maximum de tendresse, de vague, de sincerite et de distraction, mais, pensant sans doute qu'il n'y avait plus qu'a repondre, il nous dit: --J'ai des amis partout ou il y a des groupes d'arbres blesses, mais non vaincus, qui se sont rapproches pour implorer ensemble avec une obstination pathetique un ciel inclement qui n'a pas pitie d'eux. --Ce n'est pas cela que je voulais dire, interrompit mon pere, aussi obstine que les arbres et aussi impitoyable que le ciel. Je demandais pour le cas ou il arriverait n'importe quoi a ma belle-mere et ou elle aurait besoin de ne pas se sentir la-bas en pays perdu, si vous y connaissez du monde? --La comme partout, je connais tout le monde et je ne connais personne, repondit Legrandin qui ne se rendait pas si vite; beaucoup les choses et fort peu les personnes. Mais les choses elles-memes y semblent des personnes, des personnes rares, d'une essence delicate et que la vie aurait decues. Parfois c'est un castel que vous rencontrez sur la falaise, au bord du chemin ou il s'est arrete pour confronter son chagrin au soir encore rose ou monte la lune d'or et dont les barques qui rentrent en striant l'eau diapree hissent a leurs mats la flamme et portent les couleurs; parfois c'est une simple maison solitaire, plutot laide, l'air timide mais romanesque, qui cache a tous les yeux quelque secret imperissable de bonheur et de desenchantement. Ce pays sans verite, ajouta-t-il avec une delicatesse machiavelique, ce pays de pure fiction est d'une mauvaise lecture pour un enfant, et ce n'est certes pas lui que je choisirais et recommanderais pour mon petit ami deja si enclin a la tristesse, pour son cur predispose. Les climats de confidence amoureuse et de regret inutile peuvent convenir au vieux desabuse que je suis, ils sont toujours malsains pour un temperament qui n'est pas forme. Croyez-moi, reprit-il avec insistance, les eaux de cette baie, deja a moitie bretonne, peuvent exercer une action sedative, d'ailleurs discutable, sur un cur qui n'est plus intact comme le mien, sur un cur dont la lesion n'est plus compensee. Elles sont contre-indiquees a votre age, petit garcon. Bonne nuit, voisins, ajouta-t-il en nous quittant avec cette brusquerie evasive dont il avait l'habitude et, se retournant vers nous avec un doigt leve de docteur, il resuma sa consultation: Pas de Balbec avant cinquante ans et encore cela depend de l'etat du cur, nous cria-t-il. Mon pere lui en reparla dans nos rencontres ulterieures, le tortura de questions, ce fut peine inutile: comme cet escroc erudit qui employait a fabriquer de faux palimpsestes un labeur et une science dont la centieme partie eut suffi a lui assurer une situation plus lucrative, mais honorable, M. Legrandin, si nous avions insiste encore, aurait fini par edifier toute une ethique de paysage et une geographie celeste de la basse Normandie, plutot que de nous avouer qu'a deux kilometres de Balbec habitait sa propre sur, et d'etre oblige a nous offrir une lettre d'introduction qui n'eut pas ete pour lui un tel sujet d'effroi s'il avait ete absolument certain,--comme il aurait du l'etre en effet avec l'experience qu'il avait du caractere de ma grand'mere--que nous n'en aurions pas profite. Nous rentrions toujours de bonne heure de nos promenades pour pouvoir faire une visite a ma tante Leonie avant le diner. Au commencement de la saison ou le jour finit tot, quand nous arrivions rue du Saint-Esprit, il y avait encore un reflet du couchant sur les vitres de la maison et un bandeau de pourpre au fond des bois du Calvaire qui se refletait plus loin dans l'etang, rougeur qui, accompagnee souvent d'un froid assez vif, s'associait, dans mon esprit, a la rougeur du feu au-dessus duquel rotissait le poulet qui ferait succeder pour moi au plaisir poetique donne par la promenade, le plaisir de la gourmandise, de la chaleur et du repos. Dans l'ete, au contraire, quand nous rentrions, le soleil ne se couchait pas encore; et pendant la visite que nous faisions chez ma tante Leonie, sa lumiere qui s'abaissait et touchait la fenetre etait arretee entre les grands rideaux et les embrasses, divisee, ramifiee, filtree, et incrustant de petits morceaux d'or le bois de citronnier de la commode, illuminait obliquement la chambre avec la delicatesse qu'elle prend dans les sous-bois. Mais certains jours fort rares, quand nous rentrions, il y avait bien longtemps que la commode avait perdu ses incrustations momentanees, il n'y avait plus quand nous arrivions rue du Saint-Esprit nul reflet de couchant etendu sur les vitres et l'etang au pied du calvaire avait perdu sa rougeur, quelquefois il etait deja couleur d'opale et un long rayon de lune qui allait en s'elargissant et se fendillait de toutes les rides de",4.061927305158561,1.825136214834936,0.34086032641515773,0.11004668925996756,4.496847414880202,4.0,2.6011061083327713,31.72,23.0,26.40760496523681,1.3215636822194199,1.0,0.6518972805248324,1586,643,0.40542244640605296,8173,50,24.52964076797838,44987061717.12144,23430761.31100075,0.7261479208816071,0.7269168991479091,62.83491248423711,12.375251450189158,11.717240788319668,15.537936948297606,15.610151324085756,9.708297604035312,53.47283732660782,6.9,True,54.0,0.884375,4.256770833333333,1920.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015458151123766908,0.01078002644157429,0.008135869012508899,0.008135869012508899,0.0,0.0,0.00661039357266348,0.0012203803518763348,0.0020339672531272247,0.14791666666666667,30,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pere et mon grand-pere qui m'appelaient, etonnes que je ne les eusse pas suivis dans le petit chemin qui monte vers les champs et ou ils s'etaient engages. Je le trouvai tout bourdonnant de l'odeur des aubepines. La haie formait comme une suite de chapelles qui disparaissaient sous la jonchee de leurs fleurs amoncelees en reposoir; au-dessous d'elles, le soleil posait a terre un quadrillage de clarte, comme s'il venait de traverser une verriere; leur parfum s'etendait aussi onctueux, aussi delimite en sa forme que si j'eusse ete devant l'autel de la Vierge, et les fleurs, aussi parees, tenaient chacune d'un air distrait son etincelant bouquet d'etamines, fines et rayonnantes nervures de style flamboyant comme celles qui a l'eglise ajouraient la rampe du jube ou les meneaux du vitrail et qui s'epanouissaient en blanche chair de fleur de fraisier. Combien naives et paysannes en comparaison sembleraient les eglantines qui, dans quelques semaines, monteraient elles aussi en plein soleil le meme chemin rustique, en la soie unie de leur corsage rougissant qu'un souffle defait. Mais j'avais beau rester devant les aubepines a respirer, a porter devant ma pensee qui ne savait ce qu'elle devait en faire, a perdre, a retrouver leur invisible et fixe odeur, a m'unir au rythme qui jetait leurs fleurs, ici et la, avec une allegresse juvenile et a des intervalles inattendus comme certains intervalles musicaux, elles m'offraient indefiniment le meme charme avec une profusion inepuisable, mais sans me laisser approfondir davantage, comme ces melodies qu'on rejoue cent fois de suite sans descendre plus avant dans leur secret. Je me detournais d'elles un moment, pour les aborder ensuite avec des forces plus fraiches. Je poursuivais jusque sur le talus qui, derriere la haie, montait en pente raide vers les champs, quelque coquelicot perdu, quelques bluets restes paresseusement en arriere, qui le decoraient ca et la de leurs fleurs comme la bordure d'une tapisserie ou apparait clairseme le motif agreste qui triomphera sur le panneau; rares encore, espaces comme les maisons isolees qui annoncent deja l'approche d'un village, ils m'annoncaient l'immense etendue ou deferlent les bles, ou moutonnent les nuages, et la vue d'un seul coquelicot hissant au bout de son cordage et faisant cingler au vent sa flamme rouge, au-dessus de sa bouee graisseuse et noire, me faisait battre le cur, comme au voyageur qui apercoit sur une terre basse une premiere barque echouee que repare un calfat, et s'ecrie, avant de l'avoir encore vue: La Mer! Puis je revenais devant les aubepines comme devant ces chefs-d'uvre dont on croit qu'on saura mieux les voir quand on a cesse un moment de les regarder, mais j'avais beau me faire un ecran de mes mains pour n'avoir qu'elles sous les yeux, le sentiment qu'elles eveillaient en moi restait obscur et vague, cherchant en vain a se degager, a venir adherer a leurs fleurs. Elles ne m'aidaient pas a l'eclaircir, et je ne pouvais demander a d'autres fleurs de le satisfaire. Alors, me donnant cette joie que nous eprouvons quand nous voyons de notre peintre prefere une uvre qui differe de celles que nous connaissions, ou bien si l'on nous mene devant un tableau dont nous n'avions vu jusque-la qu'une esquisse au crayon, si un morceau entendu seulement au piano nous apparait ensuite revetu des couleurs de l'orchestre, mon grand-pere m'appelant et me designant la haie de Tansonville, me dit: Toi qui aimes les aubepines, regarde un peu cette epine rose; est-elle jolie! En effet c'etait une epine, mais rose, plus belle encore que les blanches. Elle aussi avait une parure de fete,--de ces seules vraies fetes que sont les fetes religieuses, puisqu'un caprice contingent ne les applique pas comme les fetes mondaines a un jour quelconque qui ne leur est pas specialement destine, qui n'a rien d'essentiellement ferie,--mais une parure plus riche encore, car les fleurs attachees sur la branche, les unes au-dessus des autres, de maniere a ne laisser aucune place qui ne fut decoree, comme des pompons qui enguirlandent une houlette rococo, etaient en couleur, par consequent d'une qualite superieure selon l'esthetique de Combray si l'on en jugeait par l'echelle des prix dans le magasin de la Place ou chez Camus ou etaient plus chers ceux des biscuits qui etaient roses. Moi-meme j'appreciais plus le fromage a la creme rose, celui ou l'on m'avait permis d'ecraser des fraises. Et justement ces fleurs avaient choisi une de ces teintes de chose mangeable, ou de tendre embellissement a une toilette pour une grande fete, qui, parce qu'elles leur presentent la raison de leur superiorite, sont celles qui semblent belles avec le plus d'evidence aux yeux des enfants, et a cause de cela, gardent toujours pour eux quelque chose de plus vif et de plus naturel que les autres teintes, meme lorsqu'ils ont compris qu'elles ne promettaient rien a leur gourmandise et n'avaient pas ete choisies par la couturiere. Et certes, je l'avais tout de suite senti, comme devant les epines blanches mais avec plus d'emerveillement, que ce n'etait pas facticement, par un artifice de fabrication humaine, qu'etait traduite l'intention de festivite dans les fleurs, mais que c'etait la nature qui, spontanement, l'avait exprimee avec la naivete d'une commercante de village travaillant pour un reposoir, en surchargeant l'arbuste de ces rosettes d'un ton trop tendre et d'un pompadour provincial. Au haut des branches, comme autant de ces petits rosiers aux pots caches dans des papiers en dentelles, dont aux grandes fetes on faisait rayonner sur l'autel les minces fusees, pullulaient mille petits boutons d'une teinte plus pale qui, en s'entr'ouvrant, laissaient voir, comme au fond d'une coupe de marbre rose, de rouges sanguines et trahissaient plus encore que les fleurs, l'essence particuliere, irresistible, de l'epine, qui, partout ou elle bourgeonnait, ou elle allait fleurir, ne le pouvait qu'en rose. Intercale dans la haie, mais aussi different d'elle qu'une jeune fille en robe de fete au milieu de personnes en neglige qui resteront a la maison, tout pret pour le mois de Marie, dont il semblait faire partie deja, tel brillait en souriant dans sa fraiche toilette rose, l'arbuste catholique et delicieux. La haie laissait voir a l'interieur du parc une allee bordee de jasmins, de pensees et de verveines entre lesquelles des giroflees ouvraient leur bourse fraiche, du rose odorant et passe d'un cuir ancien de Cordoue, tandis que sur le gravier un long tuyau d'arrosage peint en vert, deroulant ses circuits, dressait aux points ou il etait perce au-dessus des fleurs, dont il imbibait les parfums, l'eventail vertical et prismatique de ses gouttelettes multicolores. Tout a coup, je m'arretai, je ne pus plus bouger, comme il arrive quand une vision ne s'adresse pas seulement a nos regards, mais requiert des perceptions plus profondes et dispose de notre etre tout entier. Une fillette d'un blond roux qui avait l'air de rentrer de promenade et tenait a la main une beche de jardinage, nous regardait, levant son visage seme de taches roses. Ses yeux noirs brillaient et comme je ne savais pas alors, ni ne l'ai appris depuis, reduire en ses elements objectifs une impression forte, comme je n'avais pas, ainsi qu'on dit, assez d'esprit d'observation pour degager la notion de leur couleur, pendant longtemps, chaque fois que je repensai a elle, le souvenir de leur eclat se presentait aussitot a moi comme celui d'un vif azur, puisqu'elle etait blonde: de sorte que, peut-etre si elle n'avait pas eu des yeux aussi noirs,--ce qui frappait tant la premiere fois qu'on la voyait--je n'aurais pas ete, comme je le fus, plus particulierement amoureux, en elle, de ses yeux bleus. Je la regardais, d'abord de ce regard qui n'est pas que le porte-parole des yeux, mais a la fenetre duquel se penchent tous les sens, anxieux et petrifies, le regard qui voudrait toucher, capturer, emmener le corps qu'il regarde et l'ame avec lui; puis, tant j'avais peur que d'une seconde a l'autre mon grand-pere et mon pere, apercevant cette jeune fille, me fissent eloigner en me disant de courir un peu devant eux, d'un second regard, inconsciemment supplicateur, qui tachait de la forcer a faire attention a moi, a me connaitre! Elle jeta en avant et de cote ses pupilles pour prendre connaissance de mon grand'pere et de mon pere, et sans doute l'idee qu'elle en rapporta fut celle que nous etions ridicules, car elle se detourna et d'un air indifferent et dedaigneux, se placa de cote pour epargner a son visage d'etre dans leur champ visuel; et tandis que continuant a marcher et ne l'ayant pas apercue, ils m'avaient depasse, elle laissa ses regards filer de toute leur longueur dans ma direction, sans expression particuliere, sans avoir l'air de me voir, mais avec une fixite et un sourire dissimule, que je ne pouvais interpreter d'apres les notions que l'on m'avait donnees sur la bonne education, que comme une preuve d'outrageant mepris; et sa main esquissait en meme temps un geste indecent, auquel quand il etait adresse en public a une personne qu'on ne connaissait pas, le petit dictionnaire de civilite que je portais en moi ne donnait qu'un seul sens, celui d'une intention insolente. --Allons, Gilberte, viens; qu'est-ce que tu fais, cria d'une voix percante et autoritaire une dame en blanc que je n'avais pas vue, et a quelque distance de laquelle un Monsieur habille de coutil et que je ne connaissais pas, fixait sur moi des yeux qui lui sortaient de la tete; et cessant brusquement de sourire, la jeune fille prit sa beche et s'eloigna sans se retourner de mon cote, d'un air docile, impenetrable et sournois. Ainsi passa pres de moi ce nom de Gilberte, donne comme un talisman qui me permettait peut-etre de retrouver un jour celle dont il venait de faire une personne et qui, l'instant d'avant, n'etait qu'une image incertaine. Ainsi passa-t-il, profere au-dessus des jasmins et des giroflees, aigre et frais comme les gouttes de l'arrosoir vert; impregnant, irisant la zone d'air pur qu'il avait traversee--et qu'il isolait,--du mystere de la vie de celle qu'il designait",4.860401303650426,1.5959698537260156,0.328688042743412,0.05336275367306961,4.680618158403091,4.0,2.643631452134001,50.096774193548384,47.0,32.89607765491265,1.3155183515775917,1.0,0.6253890007595876,1553,690,0.44430135222150674,8474,31,24.650796247765186,50781413457.72645,26670910.429478176,0.8634307076533635,0.8592888877309602,44.69392165008415,19.470858484099455,13.742535322968653,22.794665891199134,25.664098622852748,11.131178364455891,73.7284548117068,11.838709677419354,True,58.0,0.8860294117647058,4.45063025210084,1904.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0069074402999802645,0.003552397868561279,0.0041444641799881585,0.16228991596638656,32,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"sans les faire jamais devier. Parfois dans le ciel de l'apres-midi passait la lune blanche comme une nuee, furtive, sans eclat, comme une actrice dont ce n'est pas l'heure de jouer et qui, de la salle, en toilette de ville, regarde un moment ses camarades, s'effacant, ne voulant pas qu'on fasse attention a elle. J'aimais a retrouver son image dans des tableaux et dans des livres, mais ces uvres d'art etaient bien differentes--du moins pendant les premieres annees, avant que Bloch eut accoutume mes yeux et ma pensee a des harmonies plus subtiles--de celles ou la lune me paraitrait belle aujourd'hui et ou je ne l'eusse pas reconnue alors. C'etait, par exemple, quelque roman de Saintine, un paysage de Gleyre ou elle decoupe nettement sur le ciel une faucille d'argent, de ces uvres naivement incompletes comme etaient mes propres impressions et que les surs de ma grand'mere s'indignaient de me voir aimer. Elles pensaient qu'on doit mettre devant les enfants, et qu'ils font preuve de gout en aimant d'abord, les uvres que, parvenu a la maturite, on admire definitivement. C'est sans doute qu'elles se figuraient les merites esthetiques comme des objets materiels qu'un il ouvert ne peut faire autrement que de percevoir, sans avoir eu besoin d'en murir lentement des equivalents dans son propre cur. C'est du cote de Meseglise, a Montjouvain, maison situee au bord d'une grande mare et adossee a un talus buissonneux que demeurait M. Vinteuil. Aussi croisait-on souvent sur la route sa fille, conduisant un buggy a toute allure. A partir d'une certaine annee on ne la rencontra plus seule, mais avec une amie plus agee, qui avait mauvaise reputation dans le pays et qui un jour s'installa definitivement a Montjouvain. On disait: Faut-il que ce pauvre M. Vinteuil soit aveugle par la tendresse pour ne pas s'apercevoir de ce qu'on raconte, et permettre a sa fille, lui qui se scandalise d'une parole DEPLACEE, de faire vivre sous son toit une femme pareille. Il dit que c'est une femme superieure, un grand cur et qu'elle aurait eu des dispositions extraordinaires pour la musique si elle les avait cultivees. Il peut etre sur que ce n'est pas de musique qu'elle s'occupe avec sa fille. M. Vinteuil le disait; et il est en effet remarquable combien une personne excite toujours d'admiration pour ses qualites morales chez les parents de toute autre personne avec qui elle a des relations charnelles. L'amour physique, si injustement decrie, force tellement tout etre a manifester jusqu'aux moindres parcelles qu'il possede de bonte, d'abandon de soi, qu'elles resplendissent jusqu'aux yeux de l'entourage immediat. Le docteur Percepied a qui sa grosse voix et ses gros sourcils permettaient de tenir tant qu'il voulait le role de perfide dont il n'avait pas le physique, sans compromettre en rien sa reputation inebranlable et immeritee de bourru bienfaisant, savait faire rire aux larmes le cure et tout le monde en disant d'un ton rude: He bien! il parait qu'elle fait de la musique avec son amie, Mlle Vinteuil. Ca a l'air de vous etonner. Moi je sais pas. C'est le pere Vinteuil qui m'a encore dit ca hier. Apres tout, elle a bien le droit d'aimer la musique, c'te fille. Moi je ne suis pas pour contrarier les vocations artistiques des enfants. Vinteuil non plus a ce qu'il parait. Et puis lui aussi il fait de la musique avec l'amie de sa fille. Ah! sapristi on en fait une musique dans c'te boite-la. Mais qu'est-ce que vous avez a rire; mais ils font trop de musique ces gens. L'autre jour j'ai rencontre le pere Vinteuil pres du cimetiere. Il ne tenait pas sur ses jambes. Pour ceux qui comme nous virent a cette epoque M. Vinteuil eviter les personnes qu'il connaissait, se detourner quand il les apercevait, vieillir en quelques mois, s'absorber dans son chagrin, devenir incapable de tout effort qui n'avait pas directement le bonheur de sa fille pour but, passer des journees entieres devant la tombe de sa femme,--il eut ete difficile de ne pas comprendre qu'il etait en train de mourir de chagrin, et de supposer qu'il ne se rendait pas compte des propos qui couraient. Il les connaissait, peut-etre meme y ajoutait-il foi. Il n'est peut-etre pas une personne, si grande que soit sa vertu, que la complexite des circonstances ne puisse amener a vivre un jour dans la familiarite du vice qu'elle condamne le plus formellement,--sans qu'elle le reconnaisse d'ailleurs tout a fait sous le deguisement de faits particuliers qu'il revet pour entrer en contact avec elle et la faire souffrir: paroles bizarres, attitude inexplicable, un certain soir, de tel etre qu'elle a par ailleurs tant de raisons pour aimer. Mais pour un homme comme M. Vinteuil il devait entrer bien plus de souffrance que pour un autre dans la resignation a une de ces situations qu'on croit a tort etre l'apanage exclusif du monde de la boheme: elles se produisent chaque fois qu'a besoin de se reserver la place et la securite qui lui sont necessaires, un vice que la nature elle-meme fait epanouir chez un enfant, parfois rien qu'en melant les vertus de son pere et de sa mere, comme la couleur de ses yeux. Mais de ce que M. Vinteuil connaissait peut-etre la conduite de sa fille, il ne s'ensuit pas que son culte pour elle en eut ete diminue. Les faits ne penetrent pas dans le monde ou vivent nos croyances, ils n'ont pas fait naitre celles-ci, ils ne les detruisent pas; ils peuvent leur infliger les plus constants dementis sans les affaiblir, et une avalanche de malheurs ou de maladies se succedant sans interruption dans une famille, ne la fera pas douter de la bonte de son Dieu ou du talent de son medecin. Mais quand M. Vinteuil songeait a sa fille et a lui-meme du point de vue du monde, du point de vue de leur reputation, quand il cherchait a se situer avec elle au rang qu'ils occupaient dans l'estime generale, alors ce jugement d'ordre social, il le portait exactement comme l'eut fait l'habitant de Combray qui lui eut ete le plus hostile, il se voyait avec sa fille dans le dernier bas-fond, et ses manieres en avaient recu depuis peu cette humilite, ce respect pour ceux qui se trouvaient au-dessus de lui et qu'il voyait d'en bas (eussent-ils ete fort au-dessous de lui jusque-la), cette tendance a chercher a remonter jusqu'a eux, qui est une resultante presque mecanique de toutes les decheances. Un jour que nous marchions avec Swann dans une rue de Combray, M. Vinteuil qui debouchait d'une autre, s'etait trouve trop brusquement en face de nous pour avoir le temps de nous eviter; et Swann avec cette orgueilleuse charite de l'homme du monde qui, au milieu de la dissolution de tous ses prejuges moraux, ne trouve dans l'infamie d'autrui qu'une raison d'exercer envers lui une bienveillance dont les temoignages chatouillent d'autant plus l'amour-propre de celui qui les donne, qu'il les sent plus precieux a celui qui les recoit, avait longuement cause avec M. Vinteuil, a qui, jusque-la il n'adressait pas la parole, et lui avait demande avant de nous quitter s'il n'enverrait pas un jour sa fille jouer a Tansonville. C'etait une invitation qui, il y a deux ans, eut indigne M. Vinteuil, mais qui, maintenant, le remplissait de sentiments si reconnaissants qu'il se croyait oblige par eux, a ne pas avoir l'indiscretion de l'accepter. L'amabilite de Swann envers sa fille lui semblait etre en soi-meme un appui si honorable et si delicieux qu'il pensait qu'il valait peut-etre mieux ne pas s'en servir, pour avoir la douceur toute platonique de le conserver. --Quel homme exquis, nous dit-il, quand Swann nous eut quittes, avec la meme enthousiaste veneration qui tient de spirituelles et jolies bourgeoises en respect et sous le charme d'une duchesse, fut-elle laide et sotte. Quel homme exquis! Quel malheur qu'il ait fait un mariage tout a fait deplace. Et alors, tant les gens les plus sinceres sont meles d'hypocrisie et depouillent en causant avec une personne l'opinion qu'ils ont d'elle et expriment des qu'elle n'est plus la, mes parents deplorerent avec M. Vinteuil le mariage de Swann au nom de principes et de convenances auxquels (par cela meme qu'ils les invoquaient en commun avec lui, en braves gens de meme acabit) ils avaient l'air de sous-entendre qu'il n'etait pas contrevenu a Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil n'envoya pas sa fille chez Swann. Et celui-ci fut le premier a le regretter. Car chaque fois qu'il venait de quitter M. Vinteuil, il se rappelait qu'il avait depuis quelque temps un renseignement a lui demander sur quelqu'un qui portait le meme nom que lui, un de ses parents, croyait-il. Et cette fois-la il s'etait bien promis de ne pas oublier ce qu'il avait a lui dire, quand M. Vinteuil enverrait sa fille a Tansonville. Comme la promenade du cote de Meseglise etait la moins longue des deux que nous faisions autour de Combray et qu'a cause de cela on la reservait pour les temps incertains, le climat du cote de Meseglise etait assez pluvieux et nous ne perdions jamais de vue la lisiere des bois de Roussainville dans l'epaisseur desquels nous pourrions nous mettre a couvert. Souvent le soleil se cachait derriere une nuee qui deformait son ovale et dont il jaunissait la bordure. L'eclat, mais non la clarte, etait enleve a la campagne ou toute vie semblait suspendue, tandis que le petit village de Roussainville sculptait sur le ciel le relief de ses aretes blanches avec une precision et un fini accablants. Un peu de vent faisait envoler un corbeau qui retombait dans le lointain, et, contre le ciel blanchissant, le lointain des bois paraissait plus bleu, comme peint dans ces camaieux qui decorent les trumeaux des anciennes demeures. Mais d'autres fois se mettait a tomber la pluie dont nous avait menaces le capucin que l'opticien avait a sa devanture; les gouttes d'eau comme des oiseaux migrateurs qui prennent leur vol tous ensemble, descendaient a rangs presses",4.008435353284018,1.7720272672216257,0.3258530832788455,0.09629993624438453,4.5363057324840765,4.0,2.6854681563238763,30.784313725490197,24.0,27.07311358951881,1.3178343949044586,1.0,0.6446253229356235,1570,612,0.38980891719745225,8170,51,22.72231973003561,7382068567.88809,3907924.0698189996,0.712415412068367,0.7170152092466548,64.10013175971027,11.966328212813789,11.59491666259705,15.167228674909456,15.328156862745097,9.911949044585988,53.14100162357937,6.882352941176471,True,61.0,0.8973001588141875,4.32503970354685,1889.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009969481180061038,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015666327568667347,0.003662258392675483,0.006103763987792472,0.1439915299100053,34,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pour les etres heureux qui vivaient, qui voyageaient avec elle; deployant sous l'epinier rose, a hauteur de mon epaule, la quintessence de leur familiarite, pour moi si douloureuse, avec elle, avec l'inconnu de sa vie ou je n'entrerais pas. Un instant (tandis que nous nous eloignions et que mon grand-pere murmurait: Ce pauvre Swann, quel role ils lui font jouer: on le fait partir pour qu'elle reste seule avec son Charlus, car c'est lui, je l'ai reconnu! Et cette petite, melee a toute cette infamie!) l'impression laissee en moi par le ton despotique avec lequel la mere de Gilberte lui avait parle sans qu'elle repliquat, en me la montrant comme forcee d'obeir a quelqu'un, comme n'etant pas superieure a tout, calma un peu ma souffrance, me rendit quelque espoir et diminua mon amour. Mais bien vite cet amour s'eleva de nouveau en moi comme une reaction par quoi mon cur humilie voulait se mettre de niveau avec Gilberte ou l'abaisser jusqu'a lui. Je l'aimais, je regrettais de ne pas avoir eu le temps et l'inspiration de l'offenser, de lui faire mal, et de la forcer a se souvenir de moi. Je la trouvais si belle que j'aurais voulu pouvoir revenir sur mes pas, pour lui crier en haussant les epaules: Comme je vous trouve laide, grotesque, comme vous me repugnez! Cependant je m'eloignais, emportant pour toujours, comme premier type d'un bonheur inaccessible aux enfants de mon espece de par des lois naturelles impossibles a transgresser, l'image d'une petite fille rousse, a la peau semee de taches roses, qui tenait une beche et qui riait en laissant filer sur moi de longs regards sournois et inexpressifs. Et deja le charme dont son nom avait encense cette place sous les epines roses ou il avait ete entendu ensemble par elle et par moi, allait gagner, enduire, embaumer, tout ce qui l'approchait, ses grands-parents que les miens avaient eu l'ineffable bonheur de connaitre, la sublime profession d'agent de change, le douloureux quartier des Champs-Elysees qu'elle habitait a Paris. Leonie, dit mon grand-pere en rentrant, j'aurais voulu t'avoir avec nous tantot. Tu ne reconnaitrais pas Tansonville. Si j'avais ose, je t'aurais coupe une branche de ces epines roses que tu aimais tant. Mon grand-pere racontait ainsi notre promenade a ma tante Leonie, soit pour la distraire, soit qu'on n'eut pas perdu tout espoir d'arriver a la faire sortir. Or elle aimait beaucoup autrefois cette propriete, et d'ailleurs les visites de Swann avaient ete les dernieres qu'elle avait recues, alors qu'elle fermait deja sa porte a tout le monde. Et de meme que quand il venait maintenant prendre de ses nouvelles (elle etait la seule personne de chez nous qu'il demandat encore a voir), elle lui faisait repondre qu'elle etait fatiguee, mais qu'elle le laisserait entrer la prochaine fois, de meme elle dit ce soir-la: Oui, un jour qu'il fera beau, j'irai en voiture jusqu'a la porte du parc. C'est sincerement qu'elle le disait. Elle eut aime revoir Swann et Tansonville; mais le desir qu'elle en avait suffisait a ce qui lui restait de forces; sa realisation les eut excedees. Quelquefois le beau temps lui rendait un peu de vigueur, elle se levait, s'habillait; la fatigue commencait avant qu'elle fut passee dans l'autre chambre et elle reclamait son lit. Ce qui avait commence pour elle--plus tot seulement que cela n'arrive d'habitude,--c'est ce grand renoncement de la vieillesse qui se prepare a la mort, s'enveloppe dans sa chrysalide, et qu'on peut observer, a la fin des vies qui se prolongent tard, meme entre les anciens amants qui se sont le plus aimes, entre les amis unis par les liens les plus spirituels et qui a partir d'une certaine annee cessent de faire le voyage ou la sortie necessaire pour se voir, cessent de s'ecrire et savent qu'ils ne communiqueront plus en ce monde. Ma tante devait parfaitement savoir qu'elle ne reverrait pas Swann, qu'elle ne quitterait plus jamais la maison, mais cette reclusion definitive devait lui etre rendue assez aisee pour la raison meme qui selon nous aurait du la lui rendre plus douloureuse: c'est que cette reclusion lui etait imposee par la diminution qu'elle pouvait constater chaque jour dans ses forces, et qui, en faisant de chaque action, de chaque mouvement, une fatigue, sinon une souffrance, donnait pour elle a l'inaction, a l'isolement, au silence, la douceur reparatrice et benie du repos. Ma tante n'alla pas voir la haie d'epines roses, mais a tous moments je demandais a mes parents si elle n'irait pas, si autrefois elle allait souvent a Tansonville, tachant de les faire parler des parents et grands-parents de Mlle Swann qui me semblaient grands comme des Dieux. Ce nom, devenu pour moi presque mythologique, de Swann, quand je causais avec mes parents, je languissais du besoin de le leur entendre dire, je n'osais pas le prononcer moi-meme, mais je les entrainais sur des sujets qui avoisinaient Gilberte et sa famille, qui la concernaient, ou je ne me sentais pas exile trop loin d'elle; et je contraignais tout d'un coup mon pere, en feignant de croire par exemple que la charge de mon grand-pere avait ete deja avant lui dans notre famille, ou que la haie d'epines roses que voulait voir ma tante Leonie se trouvait en terrain communal, a rectifier mon assertion, a me dire, comme malgre moi, comme de lui-meme: Mais non, cette charge-la etait au pere de Swann, cette haie fait partie du parc de Swann. Alors j'etais oblige de reprendre ma respiration, tant, en se posant sur la place ou il etait toujours ecrit en moi, pesait a m'etouffer ce nom qui, au moment ou je l'entendais, me paraissait plus plein que tout autre, parce qu'il etait lourd de toutes les fois ou, d'avance, je l'avais mentalement profere. Il me causait un plaisir que j'etais confus d'avoir ose reclamer a mes parents, car ce plaisir etait si grand qu'il avait du exiger d'eux pour qu'ils me le procurassent beaucoup de peine, et sans compensation, puisqu'il n'etait pas un plaisir pour eux. Aussi je detournais la conversation par discretion. Par scrupule aussi. Toutes les seductions singulieres que je mettais dans ce nom de Swann, je les retrouvais en lui des qu'ils le prononcaient. Il me semblait alors tout d'un coup que mes parents ne pouvaient pas ne pas les ressentir, qu'ils se trouvaient places a mon point de vue, qu'ils apercevaient a leur tour, absolvaient, epousaient mes reves, et j'etais malheureux comme si je les avais vaincus et depraves. Cette annee-la, quand, un peu plus tot que d'habitude, mes parents eurent fixe le jour de rentrer a Paris, le matin du depart, comme on m'avait fait friser pour etre photographie, coiffer avec precaution un chapeau que je n'avais encore jamais mis et revetir une douillette de velours, apres m'avoir cherche partout, ma mere me trouva en larmes dans le petit raidillon, contigu a Tansonville, en train de dire adieu aux aubepines, entourant de mes bras les branches piquantes, et, comme une princesse de tragedie a qui peseraient ces vains ornements, ingrat envers l'importune main qui en formant tous ces nuds avait pris soin sur mon front d'assembler mes cheveux, foulant aux pieds mes papillotes arrachees et mon chapeau neuf. Ma mere ne fut pas touchee par mes larmes, mais elle ne put retenir un cri a la vue de la coiffe defoncee et de la douillette perdue. Je ne l'entendis pas: O mes pauvres petites aubepines, disais-je en pleurant, ce n'est pas vous qui voudriez me faire du chagrin, me forcer a partir. Vous, vous ne m'avez jamais fait de peine! Aussi je vous aimerai toujours. Et, essuyant mes larmes, je leur promettais, quand je serais grand, de ne pas imiter la vie insensee des autres hommes et, meme a Paris, les jours de printemps, au lieu d'aller faire des visites et ecouter des niaiseries, de partir dans la campagne voir les premieres aubepines. Une fois dans les champs, on ne les quittait plus pendant tout le reste de la promenade qu'on faisait du cote de Meseglise. Ils etaient perpetuellement parcourus, comme par un chemineau invisible, par le vent qui etait pour moi le genie particulier de Combray. Chaque annee, le jour de notre arrivee, pour sentir que j'etais bien a Combray, je montais le retrouver qui courait dans les sayons et me faisait courir a sa suite. On avait toujours le vent a cote de soi du cote de Meseglise, sur cette plaine bombee ou pendant des lieues il ne rencontre aucun accident de terrain. Je savais que Mlle Swann allait souvent a Laon passer quelques jours et, bien que ce fut a plusieurs lieues, la distance se trouvant compensee par l'absence de tout obstacle, quand, par les chauds apres-midi, je voyais un meme souffle, venu de l'extreme horizon, abaisser les bles les plus eloignes, se propager comme un flot sur toute l'immense etendue et venir se coucher, murmurant et tiede, parmi les sainfoins et les trefles, a mes pieds, cette plaine qui nous etait commune a tous deux semblait nous rapprocher, nous unir, je pensais que ce souffle avait passe aupres d'elle, que c'etait quelque message d'elle qu'il me chuchotait sans que je pusse le comprendre, et je l'embrassais au passage. A gauche etait un village qui s'appelait Champieu (Campus Pagani, selon le cure). Sur la droite, on apercevait par dela les bles, les deux clochers ciseles et rustiques de Saint-Andre-des-Champs, eux-memes effiles, ecailleux, imbriques d'alveoles, guilloches, jaunissants et grumeleux, comme deux epis. A intervalles symetriques, au milieu de l'inimitable ornementation de leurs feuilles qu'on ne peut confondre avec la feuille d'aucun autre arbre fruitier, les pommiers ouvraient leurs larges petales de satin blanc ou suspendaient les timides bouquets de leurs rougissants boutons. C'est du cote de Meseglise que j'ai remarque pour la premiere fois l'ombre ronde que les pommiers font sur la terre ensoleillee, et aussi ces soies d'or impalpable que le couchant tisse obliquement sous les feuilles, et que je voyais mon pere interrompre de sa canne",4.205567407116952,1.6825970267209833,0.33598194395113495,0.07854604502060045,4.565772669220945,4.0,2.573408250238347,34.8,28.0,28.35222899330648,1.288633461047254,1.0,0.5902234979451351,1566,632,0.40357598978288634,8258,45,27.78667347286365,1168419939387.7654,607602672.5885415,0.7999466386708346,0.7938837575358014,62.49460919540232,13.187874840357598,11.297417166548648,16.26993614303959,17.474789272030655,10.196168582375478,56.766794380587484,7.644444444444445,True,66.0,0.874154966198648,4.2943317732709305,1923.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004436378302077031,0.004033071183706392,0.004234724742891712,0.15080603224128966,33,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"du ciel. Elles ne se separent point, elles ne vont pas a l'aventure pendant la rapide traversee, mais chacune tenant sa place, attire a elle celle qui la suit et le ciel en est plus obscurci qu'au depart des hirondelles. Nous nous refugions dans le bois. Quand leur voyage semblait fini, quelques-unes, plus debiles, plus lentes, arrivaient encore. Mais nous ressortions de notre abri, car les gouttes se plaisent aux feuillages, et la terre etait deja presque sechee que plus d'une s'attardait a jouer sur les nervures d'une feuille, et suspendue a la pointe, reposee, brillant au soleil, tout d'un coup se laissait glisser de toute la hauteur de la branche et nous tombait sur le nez. Souvent aussi nous allions nous abriter, pele-mele avec les Saints et les Patriarches de pierre sous le porche de Saint-Andre-des-Champs. Que cette eglise etait francaise! Au-dessus de la porte, les Saints, les rois-chevaliers une fleur de lys a la main, des scenes de noces et de funerailles, etaient representes comme ils pouvaient l'etre dans l'ame de Francoise. Le sculpteur avait aussi narre certaines anecdotes relatives a Aristote et a Virgile de la meme facon que Francoise a la cuisine parlait volontiers de saint Louis comme si elle l'avait personnellement connu, et generalement pour faire honte par la comparaison a mes grands-parents moins justes. On sentait que les notions que l'artiste medieval et la paysanne medievale (survivant au XIXe siecle) avaient de l'histoire ancienne ou chretienne, et qui se distinguaient par autant d'inexactitude que de bonhomie, ils les tenaient non des livres, mais d'une tradition a la fois antique et directe, ininterrompue, orale, deformee, meconnaissable et vivante. Une autre personnalite de Combray que je reconnaissais aussi, virtuelle et prophetisee, dans la sculpture gothique de Saint-Andre-des-Champs c'etait le jeune Theodore, le garcon de chez Camus. Francoise sentait d'ailleurs si bien en lui un pays et un contemporain que, quand ma tante Leonie etait trop malade pour que Francoise put suffire a la retourner dans son lit, a la porter dans son fauteuil, plutot que de laisser la fille de cuisine monter se faire bien voir de ma tante, elle appelait Theodore. Or, ce garcon qui passait et avec raison pour si mauvais sujet, etait tellement rempli de l'ame qui avait decore Saint-Andre-des-Champs et notamment des sentiments de respect que Francoise trouvait dus aux pauvres malades, a sa pauvre maitresse, qu'il avait pour soulever la tete de ma tante sur son oreiller la mine naive et zelee des petits anges des bas-reliefs, s'empressant, un cierge a la main, autour de la Vierge defaillante, comme si les visages de pierre sculptee, grisatres et nus, ainsi que sont les bois en hiver, n'etaient qu'un ensommeillement, qu'une reserve, prete a refleurir dans la vie en innombrables visages populaires, reverends et futes comme celui de Theodore, enlumines de la rougeur d'une pomme mure. Non plus appliquee a la pierre comme ces petits anges, mais detachee du porche, d'une stature plus qu'humaine, debout sur un socle comme sur un tabouret qui lui evitat de poser ses pieds sur le sol humide, une sainte avait les joues pleines, le sein ferme et qui gonflait la draperie comme une grappe mure dans un sac de crin, le front etroit, le nez court et mutin, les prunelles enfoncees, l'air valide, insensible et courageux des paysannes de la contree. Cette ressemblance qui insinuait dans la statue une douceur que je n'y avais pas cherchee, etait souvent certifiee par quelque fille des champs, venue comme nous se mettre a couvert et dont la presence, pareille a celle de ces feuillages parietaires qui ont pousse a cote des feuillages sculptes, semblait destinee a permettre, par une confrontation avec la nature, de juger de la verite de l'uvre d'art. Devant nous, dans le lointain, terre promise ou maudite, Roussainville, dans les murs duquel je n'ai jamais penetre, Roussainville, tantot, quand la pluie avait deja cesse pour nous, continuait a etre chatie comme un village de la Bible par toutes les lances de l'orage qui flagellaient obliquement les demeures de ses habitants, ou bien etait deja pardonne par Dieu le Pere qui faisait descendre vers lui, inegalement longues, comme les rayons d'un ostensoir d'autel, les tiges d'or effrangees de son soleil reparu. Quelquefois le temps etait tout a fait gate, il fallait rentrer et rester enferme dans la maison. Ca et la au loin dans la campagne que l'obscurite et l'humidite faisaient ressembler a la mer, des maisons isolees, accrochees au flanc d'une colline plongee dans la nuit et dans l'eau, brillaient comme des petits bateaux qui ont replie leurs voiles et sont immobiles au large pour toute la nuit. Mais qu'importait la pluie, qu'importait l'orage! L'ete, le mauvais temps n'est qu'une humeur passagere, superficielle, du beau temps sous-jacent et fixe, bien different du beau temps instable et fluide de l'hiver et qui, au contraire, installe sur la terre ou il s'est solidifie en denses feuillages sur lesquels la pluie peut s'egoutter sans compromettre la resistance de leur permanente joie, a hisse pour toute la saison, jusque dans les rues du village, aux murs des maisons et des jardins, ses pavillons de soie violette ou blanche. Assis dans le petit salon, ou j'attendais l'heure du diner en lisant, j'entendais l'eau degoutter de nos marronniers, mais je savais que l'averse ne faisait que vernir leurs feuilles et qu'ils promettaient de demeurer la, comme des gages de l'ete, toute la nuit pluvieuse, a assurer la continuite du beau temps; qu'il avait beau pleuvoir, demain, au-dessus de la barriere blanche de Tansonville, onduleraient, aussi nombreuses, de petites feuilles en forme de cur; et c'est sans tristesse que j'apercevais le peuplier de la rue des Perchamps adresser a l'orage des supplications et des salutations desesperees; c'est sans tristesse que j'entendais au fond du jardin les derniers roulements du tonnerre roucouler dans les lilas. Si le temps etait mauvais des le matin, mes parents renoncaient a la promenade et je ne sortais pas. Mais je pris ensuite l'habitude d'aller, ces jours-la, marcher seul du cote de Meseglise-la-Vineuse, dans l'automne ou nous dumes venir a Combray pour la succession de ma tante Leonie, car elle etait enfin morte, faisant triompher a la fois ceux qui pretendaient que son regime affaiblissant finirait par la tuer, et non moins les autres qui avaient toujours soutenu qu'elle souffrait d'une maladie non pas imaginaire mais organique, a l'evidence de laquelle les sceptiques seraient bien obliges de se rendre quand elle y aurait succombe; et ne causant par sa mort de grande douleur qu'a un seul etre, mais a celui-la, sauvage. Pendant les quinze jours que dura la derniere maladie de ma tante, Francoise ne la quitta pas un instant, ne se deshabilla pas, ne laissa personne lui donner aucun soin, et ne quitta son corps que quand il fut enterre. Alors nous comprimes que cette sorte de crainte ou Francoise avait vecu des mauvaises paroles, des soupcons, des coleres de ma tante avait developpe chez elle un sentiment que nous avions pris pour de la haine et qui etait de la veneration et de l'amour. Sa veritable maitresse, aux decisions impossibles a prevoir, aux ruses difficiles a dejouer, au bon cur facile a flechir, sa souveraine, son mysterieux et tout-puissant monarque n'etait plus. A cote d'elle nous comptions pour bien peu de chose. Il etait loin le temps ou quand nous avions commence a venir passer nos vacances a Combray, nous possedions autant de prestige que ma tante aux yeux de Francoise. Cet automne-la tout occupes des formalites a remplir, des entretiens avec les notaires et avec les fermiers, mes parents n'ayant guere de loisir pour faire des sorties que le temps d'ailleurs contrariait, prirent l'habitude de me laisser aller me promener sans eux du cote de Meseglise, enveloppe dans un grand plaid qui me protegeait contre la pluie et que je jetais d'autant plus volontiers sur mes epaules que je sentais que ses rayures ecossaises scandalisaient Francoise, dans l'esprit de qui on n'aurait pu faire entrer l'idee que la couleur des vetements n'a rien a faire avec le deuil et a qui d'ailleurs le chagrin que nous avions de la mort de ma tante plaisait peu, parce que nous n'avions pas donne de grand repas funebre, que nous ne prenions pas un son de voix special pour parler d'elle, que meme parfois je chantonnais. Je suis sur que dans un livre--et en cela j'etais bien moi-meme comme Francoise--cette conception du deuil d'apres la Chanson de Roland et le portail de Saint-Andre-des-Champs m'eut ete sympathique. Mais des que Francoise etait aupres de moi, un demon me poussait a souhaiter qu'elle fut en colere, je saisissais le moindre pretexte pour lui dire que je regrettais ma tante parce que c'etait une bonne femme, malgre ses ridicules, mais nullement parce que c'etait ma tante, qu'elle eut pu etre ma tante et me sembler odieuse, et sa mort ne me faire aucune peine, propos qui m'eussent semble ineptes dans un livre. Si alors Francoise remplie comme un poete d'un flot de pensees confuses sur le chagrin, sur les souvenirs de famille, s'excusait de ne pas savoir repondre a mes theories et disait: Je ne sais pas m'esprimer, je triomphais de cet aveu avec un bon sens ironique et brutal digne du docteur Percepied; et si elle ajoutait: Elle etait tout de meme de la parentese, il reste toujours le respect qu'on doit a la parentese, je haussais les epaules et je me disais: Je suis bien bon de discuter avec une illettree qui fait des cuirs pareils, adoptant ainsi pour juger Francoise le point de vue mesquin d'hommes dont ceux qui les meprisent le plus dans l'impartialite de la meditation, sont fort capables de tenir le role quand ils jouent une des scenes vulgaires de la vie. Mes promenades de cet automne-la furent d'autant plus agreables que je les faisais apres de longues heures passees sur un livre. Quand j'etais fatigue d'avoir lu toute la matinee dans la salle, jetant mon plaid sur",4.178275988158983,2.0059969462960883,0.3606792001979177,0.10371003213273838,4.659774436090226,4.0,2.6436495904603117,38.0,30.5,29.25991895311498,1.3214285714285714,1.0,0.6382282526980997,1596,688,0.43107769423558895,8362,42,25.07614671132954,77701990467.13496,40617872.695836365,0.7815724589475771,0.7999284863471985,56.472142857142885,14.822857142857142,12.247364363353366,17.881704260651627,19.51753759398496,10.820526315789472,62.12280701754386,9.166666666666666,True,59.0,0.8849973863042342,4.371144798745426,1913.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00967870684494113,0.00967870684494113,0.00967870684494113,0.007483536220315307,0.0,0.0,0.007982438635002993,0.006585511873877469,0.004789463181001796,0.1578672242550967,35,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"mes epaules, je sortais: mon corps oblige depuis longtemps de garder l'immobilite, mais qui s'etait charge sur place d'animation et de vitesse accumulees, avait besoin ensuite, comme une toupie qu'on lache, de les depenser dans toutes les directions. Les murs des maisons, la haie de Tansonville, les arbres du bois de Roussainville, les buissons auxquels s'adosse Montjouvain, recevaient des coups de parapluie ou de canne, entendaient des cris joyeux, qui n'etaient, les uns et les autres, que des idees confuses qui m'exaltaient et qui n'ont pas atteint le repos dans la lumiere, pour avoir prefere a un lent et difficile eclaircissement, le plaisir d'une derivation plus aisee vers une issue immediate. La plupart des pretendues traductions de ce que nous avons ressenti ne font ainsi que nous en debarrasser en le faisant sortir de nous sous une forme indistincte qui ne nous apprend pas a le connaitre. Quand j'essaye de faire le compte de ce que je dois au cote de Meseglise, des humbles decouvertes dont il fut le cadre fortuit ou le necessaire inspirateur, je me rappelle que c'est, cet automne-la, dans une de ces promenades, pres du talus broussailleux qui protege Montjouvain, que je fus frappe pour la premiere fois de ce desaccord entre nos impressions et leur expression habituelle. Apres une heure de pluie et de vent contre lesquels j'avais lutte avec allegresse, comme j'arrivais au bord de la mare de Montjouvain devant une petite cahute recouverte en tuiles ou le jardinier de M. Vinteuil serrait ses instruments de jardinage, le soleil venait de reparaitre, et ses dorures lavees par l'averse reluisaient a neuf dans le ciel, sur les arbres, sur le mur de la cahute, sur son toit de tuile encore mouille, a la crete duquel se promenait une poule. Le vent qui soufflait tirait horizontalement les herbes folles qui avaient pousse dans la paroi du mur, et les plumes de duvet de la poule, qui, les unes et les autres se laissaient filer au gre de son souffle jusqu'a l'extremite de leur longueur, avec l'abandon de choses inertes et legeres. Le toit de tuile faisait dans la mare, que le soleil rendait de nouveau reflechissante, une marbrure rose, a laquelle je n'avais encore jamais fait attention. Et voyant sur l'eau et a la face du mur un pale sourire repondre au sourire du ciel, je m'ecriai dans mon enthousiasme en brandissant mon parapluie referme: Zut, zut, zut, zut. Mais en meme temps je sentis que mon devoir eut ete de ne pas m'en tenir a ces mots opaques et de tacher de voir plus clair dans mon ravissement. Et c'est a ce moment-la encore,--grace a un paysan qui passait, l'air deja d'etre d'assez mauvaise humeur, qui le fut davantage quand il faillit recevoir mon parapluie dans la figure, et qui repondit sans chaleur a mes beau temps, n'est-ce pas, il fait bon marcher,--que j'appris que les memes emotions ne se produisent pas simultanement, dans un ordre preetabli, chez tous les hommes. Plus tard chaque fois qu'une lecture un peu longue m'avait mis en humeur de causer, le camarade a qui je brulais d'adresser la parole venait justement de se livrer au plaisir de la conversation et desirait maintenant qu'on le laissat lire tranquille. Si je venais de penser a mes parents avec tendresse et de prendre les decisions les plus sages et les plus propres a leur faire plaisir, ils avaient employe le meme temps a apprendre une peccadille que j'avais oubliee et qu'ils me reprochaient severement au moment ou je m'elancais vers eux pour les embrasser. Parfois a l'exaltation que me donnait la solitude, s'en ajoutait une autre que je ne savais pas en departager nettement, causee par le desir de voir surgir devant moi une paysanne, que je pourrais serrer dans mes bras. Ne brusquement, et sans que j'eusse eu le temps de le rapporter exactement a sa cause, au milieu de pensees tres differentes, le plaisir dont il etait accompagne ne me semblait qu'un degre superieur de celui qu'elles me donnaient. Je faisais un merite de plus a tout ce qui etait a ce moment-la dans mon esprit, au reflet rose du toit de tuile, aux herbes folles, au village de Roussainville ou je desirais depuis longtemps aller, aux arbres de son bois, au clocher de son eglise, de cet emoi nouveau qui me les faisait seulement paraitre plus desirables parce que je croyais que c'etait eux qui le provoquaient, et qui semblait ne vouloir que me porter vers eux plus rapidement quand il enflait ma voile d'une brise puissante, inconnue et propice. Mais si ce desir qu'une femme apparut ajoutait pour moi aux charmes de la nature quelque chose de plus exaltant, les charmes de la nature, en retour, elargissaient ce que celui de la femme aurait eu de trop restreint. Il me semblait que la beaute des arbres c'etait encore la sienne et que l'ame de ces horizons, du village de Roussainville, des livres que je lisais cette annee-la, son baiser me la livrerait; et mon imagination reprenant des forces au contact de ma sensualite, ma sensualite se repandant dans tous les domaines de mon imagination, mon desir n'avait plus de limites. C'est qu'aussi,--comme il arrive dans ces moments de reverie au milieu de la nature ou l'action de l'habitude etant suspendue, nos notions abstraites des choses mises de cote, nous croyons d'une foi profonde, a l'originalite, a la vie individuelle du lieu ou nous nous trouvons--la passante qu'appelait mon desir me semblait etre non un exemplaire quelconque de ce type general: la femme, mais un produit necessaire et naturel de ce sol. Car en ce temps-la tout ce qui n'etait pas moi, la terre et les etres, me paraissait plus precieux, plus important, doue d'une existence plus reelle que cela ne parait aux hommes faits. Et la terre et les etres je ne les separais pas. J'avais le desir d'une paysanne de Meseglise ou de Roussainville, d'une pecheuse de Balbec, comme j'avais le desir de Meseglise et de Balbec. Le plaisir qu'elles pouvaient me donner m'aurait paru moins vrai, je n'aurais plus cru en lui, si j'en avais modifie a ma guise les conditions. Connaitre a Paris une pecheuse de Balbec ou une paysanne de Meseglise c'eut ete recevoir des coquillages que je n'aurais pas vus sur la plage, une fougere que je n'aurais pas trouvee dans les bois, c'eut ete retrancher au plaisir que la femme me donnerait tous ceux au milieu desquels l'avait enveloppee mon imagination. Mais errer ainsi dans les bois de Roussainville sans une paysanne a embrasser, c'etait ne pas connaitre de ces bois le tresor cache, la beaute profonde. Cette fille que je ne voyais que criblee de feuillages, elle etait elle-meme pour moi comme une plante locale d'une espece plus elevee seulement que les autres et dont la structure permet d'approcher de plus pres qu'en elles, la saveur profonde du pays. Je pouvais d'autant plus facilement le croire (et que les caresses par lesquelles elle m'y ferait parvenir, seraient aussi d'une sorte particuliere et dont je n'aurais pas pu connaitre le plaisir par une autre qu'elle), que j'etais pour longtemps encore a l'age ou on ne l'a pas encore abstrait ce plaisir de la possession des femmes differentes avec lesquelles on l'a goute, ou on ne l'a pas reduit a une notion generale qui les fait considerer des lors comme les instruments interchangeables d'un plaisir toujours identique. Il n'existe meme pas, isole, separe et formule dans l'esprit, comme le but qu'on poursuit en s'approchant d'une femme, comme la cause du trouble prealable qu'on ressent. A peine y songe-t-on comme a un plaisir qu'on aura; plutot, on l'appelle son charme a elle; car on ne pense pas a soi, on ne pense qu'a sortir de soi. Obscurement attendu, immanent et cache, il porte seulement a un tel paroxysme au moment ou il s'accomplit, les autres plaisirs que nous causent les doux regards, les baisers de celle qui est aupres de nous, qu'il nous apparait surtout a nous-meme comme une sorte de transport de notre reconnaissance pour la bonte de cur de notre compagne et pour sa touchante predilection a notre egard que nous mesurons aux bienfaits, au bonheur dont elle nous comble. Helas, c'etait en vain que j'implorais le donjon de Roussainville, que je lui demandais de faire venir aupres de moi quelque enfant de son village, comme au seul confident que j'avais eu de mes premiers desirs, quand au haut de notre maison de Combray, dans le petit cabinet sentant l'iris, je ne voyais que sa tour au milieu du carreau de la fenetre entr'ouverte, pendant qu'avec les hesitations heroiques du voyageur qui entreprend une exploration ou du desespere qui se suicide, defaillant, je me frayais en moi-meme une route inconnue et que je croyais mortelle, jusqu'au moment ou une trace naturelle comme celle d'un colimacon s'ajoutait aux feuilles du cassis sauvage qui se penchaient jusqu'a moi. En vain je le suppliais maintenant. En vain, tenant l'etendue dans le champ de ma vision, je la drainais de mes regards qui eussent voulu en ramener une femme. Je pouvais aller jusqu'au porche de Saint-Andre-des-Champs; jamais ne s'y trouvait la paysanne que je n'eusse pas manque d'y rencontrer si j'avais ete avec mon grand-pere et dans l'impossibilite de lier conversation avec elle. Je fixais indefiniment le tronc d'un arbre lointain, de derriere lequel elle allait surgir et venir a moi; l'horizon scrute restait desert, la nuit tombait, c'etait sans espoir que mon attention s'attachait, comme pour aspirer les creatures qu'ils pouvaient receler, a ce sol sterile, a cette terre epuisee; et ce n'etait plus d'allegresse, c'etait de rage que je frappais les arbres du bois de Roussainville d'entre lesquels ne sortait pas plus d'etres vivants que s'ils eussent ete des arbres peints sur la toile d'un panorama, quand, ne pouvant me resigner a rentrer a la maison avant d'avoir serre dans mes bras la femme que j'avais tant desiree, j'etais pourtant oblige de reprendre le chemin",4.524970388782316,1.794614716422939,0.3226403767023558,0.09494591844514577,4.552986512524085,4.0,2.71782321241611,38.925,33.0,26.567261337970084,1.3140655105973025,1.0,0.6566795110966258,1557,622,0.39948619139370584,8163,40,22.689689767796658,7145079449.043547,3824988.998417316,0.7547966622007198,0.7472159086089385,56.15618280346824,15.09672302504817,12.730933301510706,18.473018625561977,19.477066473988437,10.211123956326269,61.725256904303144,8.875,True,65.0,0.9004282655246253,4.369914346895075,1868.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.017509925684617733,0.007126132546065356,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007940547694187111,0.006922528759034918,0.0,0.16274089935760172,36,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"de Combray en m'avouant a moi-meme qu'etait de moins en moins probable le hasard qui l'eut mise sur mon chemin. Et s'y fut-elle trouvee, d'ailleurs, eusse-je ose lui parler? Il me semblait qu'elle m'eut considere comme un fou; je cessais de croire partages par d'autres etres, de croire vrais en dehors de moi les desirs que je formais pendant ces promenades et qui ne se realisaient pas. Ils ne m'apparaissaient plus que comme les creations purement subjectives, impuissantes, illusoires, de mon temperament. Ils n'avaient plus de lien avec la nature, avec la realite qui des lors perdait tout charme et toute signification et n'etait plus a ma vie qu'un cadre conventionnel comme l'est a la fiction d'un roman le wagon sur la banquette duquel le voyageur le lit pour tuer le temps. C'est peut-etre d'une impression ressentie aussi aupres de Montjouvain, quelques annees plus tard, impression restee obscure alors, qu'est sortie, bien apres, l'idee que je me suis faite du sadisme. On verra plus tard que, pour de tout autres raisons, le souvenir de cette impression devait jouer un role important dans ma vie. C'etait par un temps tres chaud; mes parents qui avaient du s'absenter pour toute la journee, m'avaient dit de rentrer aussi tard que je voudrais; et etant alle jusqu'a la mare de Montjouvain ou j'aimais revoir les reflets du toit de tuile, je m'etais etendu a l'ombre et endormi dans les buissons du talus qui domine la maison, la ou j'avais attendu mon pere autrefois, un jour qu'il etait alle voir M. Vinteuil. Il faisait presque nuit quand je m'eveillai, je voulus me lever, mais je vis Mlle Vinteuil (autant que je pus la reconnaitre, car je ne l'avais pas vue souvent a Combray, et seulement quand elle etait encore une enfant, tandis qu'elle commencait d'etre une jeune fille) qui probablement venait de rentrer, en face de moi, a quelques centimetres de moi, dans cette chambre ou son pere avait recu le mien et dont elle avait fait son petit salon a elle. La fenetre etait entr'ouverte, la lampe etait allumee, je voyais tous ses mouvements sans qu'elle me vit, mais en m'en allant j'aurais fait craquer les buissons, elle m'aurait entendu et elle aurait pu croire que je m'etais cache la pour l'epier. Elle etait en grand deuil, car son pere etait mort depuis peu. Nous n'etions pas alles la voir, ma mere ne l'avait pas voulu a cause d'une vertu qui chez elle limitait seule les effets de la bonte: la pudeur; mais elle la plaignait profondement. Ma mere se rappelant la triste fin de vie de M. Vinteuil, tout absorbee d'abord par les soins de mere et de bonne d'enfant qu'il donnait a sa fille, puis par les souffrances que celle-ci lui avait causees; elle revoyait le visage torture qu'avait eu le vieillard tous les derniers temps; elle savait qu'il avait renonce a jamais a achever de transcrire au net toute son uvre des dernieres annees, pauvres morceaux d'un vieux professeur de piano, d'un ancien organiste de village dont nous imaginions bien qu'ils n'avaient guere de valeur en eux-memes, mais que nous ne meprisions pas parce qu'ils en avaient tant pour lui dont ils avaient ete la raison de vivre avant qu'il les sacrifiat a sa fille, et qui pour la plupart pas meme notes, conserves seulement dans sa memoire, quelques-uns inscrits sur des feuillets epars, illisibles, resteraient inconnus; ma mere pensait a cet autre renoncement plus cruel encore auquel M. Vinteuil avait ete contraint, le renoncement a un avenir de bonheur honnete et respecte pour sa fille; quand elle evoquait toute cette detresse supreme de l'ancien maitre de piano de mes tantes, elle eprouvait un veritable chagrin et songeait avec effroi a celui autrement amer que devait eprouver Mlle Vinteuil tout mele du remords d'avoir a peu pres tue son pere. Pauvre M. Vinteuil, disait ma mere, il a vecu et il est mort pour sa fille, sans avoir recu son salaire. Le recevra-t-il apres sa mort et sous quelle forme? Il ne pourrait lui venir que d'elle. Au fond du salon de Mlle Vinteuil, sur la cheminee etait pose un petit portrait de son pere que vivement elle alla chercher au moment ou retentit le roulement d'une voiture qui venait de la route, puis elle se jeta sur un canape, et tira pres d'elle une petite table sur laquelle elle placa le portrait, comme M. Vinteuil autrefois avait mis a cote de lui le morceau qu'il avait le desir de jouer a mes parents. Bientot son amie entra. Mlle Vinteuil l'accueillit sans se lever, ses deux mains derriere la tete et se recula sur le bord oppose du sofa comme pour lui faire une place. Mais aussitot elle sentit qu'elle semblait ainsi lui imposer une attitude qui lui etait peut-etre importune. Elle pensa que son amie aimerait peut-etre mieux etre loin d'elle sur une chaise, elle se trouva indiscrete, la delicatesse de son cur s'en alarma; reprenant toute la place sur le sofa elle ferma les yeux et se mit a bailler pour indiquer que l'envie de dormir etait la seule raison pour laquelle elle s'etait ainsi etendue. Malgre la familiarite rude et dominatrice qu'elle avait avec sa camarade, je reconnaissais les gestes obsequieux et reticents, les brusques scrupules de son pere. Bientot elle se leva, feignit de vouloir fermer les volets et de n'y pas reussir. --Laisse donc tout ouvert, j'ai chaud, dit son amie. --Mais c'est assommant, on nous verra, repondit Mlle Vinteuil. Mais elle devina sans doute que son amie penserait qu'elle n'avait dit ces mots que pour la provoquer a lui repondre par certains autres qu'elle avait en effet le desir d'entendre, mais que par discretion elle voulait lui laisser l'initiative de prononcer. Aussi son regard que je ne pouvais distinguer, dut-il prendre l'expression qui plaisait tant a ma grand'mere, quand elle ajouta vivement: --Quand je dis nous voir, je veux dire nous voir lire, c'est assommant, quelque chose insignifiante qu'on fasse, de penser que des yeux vous voient. Par une generosite instinctive et une politesse involontaire elle taisait les mots premedites qu'elle avait juges indispensables a la pleine realisation de son desir. Et a tous moments au fond d'elle-meme une vierge timide et suppliante implorait et faisait reculer un soudard fruste et vainqueur. --Oui, c'est probable qu'on nous regarde a cette heure-ci, dans cette campagne frequentee, dit ironiquement son amie. Et puis quoi? Ajouta-t-elle (en croyant devoir accompagner d'un clignement d'yeux malicieux et tendre, ces mots qu'elle recita par bonte, comme un texte, qu'elle savait etre agreable a Mlle Vinteuil, d'un ton qu'elle s'efforcait de rendre cynique), quand meme on nous verrait ce n'en est que meilleur. Mlle Vinteuil fremit et se leva. Son cur scrupuleux et sensible ignorait quelles paroles devaient spontanement venir s'adapter a la scene que ses sens reclamaient. Elle cherchait le plus loin qu'elle pouvait de sa vraie nature morale, a trouver le langage propre a la fille vicieuse qu'elle desirait d'etre, mais les mots qu'elle pensait que celle-ci eut prononces sincerement lui paraissaient faux dans sa bouche. Et le peu qu'elle s'en permettait etait dit sur un ton guinde ou ses habitudes de timidite paralysaient ses velleites d'audace, et s'entremelait de: tu n'as pas froid, tu n'as pas trop chaud, tu n'as pas envie d'etre seule et de lire? --Mademoiselle me semble avoir des pensees bien lubriques, ce soir, finit-elle par dire, repetant sans doute une phrase qu'elle avait entendue autrefois dans la bouche de son amie. Dans l'echancrure de son corsage de crepe Mlle Vinteuil sentit que son amie piquait un baiser, elle poussa un petit cri, s'echappa, et elles se poursuivirent en sautant, faisant voleter leurs larges manches comme des ailes et gloussant et piaillant comme des oiseaux amoureux. Puis Mlle Vinteuil finit par tomber sur le canape, recouverte par le corps de son amie. Mais celle-ci tournait le dos a la petite table sur laquelle etait place le portrait de l'ancien professeur de piano. Mlle Vinteuil comprit que son amie ne le verrait pas si elle n'attirait pas sur lui son attention, et elle lui dit, comme si elle venait seulement de le remarquer: --Oh! ce portrait de mon pere qui nous regarde, je ne sais pas qui a pu le mettre la, j'ai pourtant dit vingt fois que ce n'etait pas sa place. Je me souvins que c'etaient les mots que M. Vinteuil avait dits a mon pere a propos du morceau de musique. Ce portrait leur servait sans doute habituellement pour des profanations rituelles, car son amie lui repondit par ces paroles qui devaient faire partie de ses reponses liturgiques: --Mais laisse-le donc ou il est, il n'est plus la pour nous embeter. Crois-tu qu'il pleurnicherait, qu'il voudrait te mettre ton manteau, s'il te voyait la, la fenetre ouverte, le vilain singe. Mlle Vinteuil repondit par des paroles de doux reproche: Voyons, voyons, qui prouvaient la bonte de sa nature, non qu'elles fussent dictees par l'indignation que cette facon de parler de son pere eut pu lui causer (evidemment c'etait la un sentiment qu'elle s'etait habituee, a l'aide de quels sophismes? a faire taire en elle dans ces minutes-la), mais parce qu'elles etaient comme un frein que pour ne pas se montrer egoiste elle mettait elle-meme au plaisir que son amie cherchait a lui procurer. Et puis cette moderation souriante en repondant a ces blasphemes, ce reproche hypocrite et tendre, paraissaient peut-etre a sa nature franche et bonne, une forme particulierement infame, une forme doucereuse de cette sceleratesse qu'elle cherchait a s'assimiler. Mais elle ne put resister a l'attrait du plaisir qu'elle eprouverait a etre traitee avec douceur par une personne si implacable envers un mort sans defense; elle sauta sur les genoux de son amie, et lui tendit chastement son front a baiser comme elle aurait pu faire si elle avait ete sa fille, sentant avec delices qu'elles allaient ainsi toutes deux au bout de la cruaute en ravissant a M. Vinteuil, jusque dans le tombeau,",3.568819603428086,1.5031950941778376,0.34294699132219364,0.11173412588133412,4.573623559539053,4.0,2.5322545776948906,26.47457627118644,20.0,24.003076026183788,1.291293213828425,1.0,0.6043279606836532,1562,631,0.4039692701664533,8226,59,23.11483255504666,10930605712.698908,5771175.138700585,0.6749434219352131,0.676792400186522,70.71989919486103,9.972344668938128,9.945555015845908,12.740918856746024,13.34905510102216,9.974852752880924,48.369582673235094,5.796610169491525,True,57.0,0.8912354804646251,4.343189017951426,1894.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009710702002832288,0.00606918875177018,0.0,0.1573389651531151,37,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"sa paternite. Son amie lui prit la tete entre ses mains et lui deposa un baiser sur le front avec cette docilite que lui rendait facile la grande affection qu'elle avait pour Mlle Vinteuil et le desir de mettre quelque distraction dans la vie si triste maintenant de l'orpheline. --Sais-tu ce que j'ai envie de lui faire a cette vieille horreur? dit-elle en prenant le portrait. Et elle murmura a l'oreille de Mlle Vinteuil quelque chose que je ne pus entendre. --Oh! tu n'oserais pas. --Je n'oserais pas cracher dessus? sur ca? dit l'amie avec une brutalite voulue. Je n'en entendis pas davantage, car Mlle Vinteuil, d'un air las, gauche, affaire, honnete et triste, vint fermer les volets et la fenetre, mais je savais maintenant, pour toutes les souffrances que pendant sa vie M. Vinteuil avait supportees a cause de sa fille, ce qu'apres la mort il avait recu d'elle en salaire. Et pourtant j'ai pense depuis que si M. Vinteuil avait pu assister a cette scene, il n'eut peut-etre pas encore perdu sa foi dans le bon cur de sa fille, et peut-etre meme n'eut-il pas eu en cela tout a fait tort. Certes, dans les habitudes de Mlle Vinteuil l'apparence du mal etait si entiere qu'on aurait eu de la peine a la rencontrer realisee a ce degre de perfection ailleurs que chez une sadique; c'est a la lumiere de la rampe des theatres du boulevard plutot que sous la lampe d'une maison de campagne veritable qu'on peut voir une fille faire cracher une amie sur le portrait d'un pere qui n'a vecu que pour elle; et il n'y a guere que le sadisme qui donne un fondement dans la vie a l'esthetique du melodrame. Dans la realite, en dehors des cas de sadisme, une fille aurait peut-etre des manquements aussi cruels que ceux de Mlle Vinteuil envers la memoire et les volontes de son pere mort, mais elle ne les resumerait pas expressement en un acte d'un symbolisme aussi rudimentaire et aussi naif; ce que sa conduite aurait de criminel serait plus voile aux yeux des autres et meme a ses yeux a elle qui ferait le mal sans se l'avouer. Mais, au-dela de l'apparence, dans le cur de Mlle Vinteuil, le mal, au debut du moins, ne fut sans doute pas sans melange. Une sadique comme elle est l'artiste du mal, ce qu'une creature entierement mauvaise ne pourrait etre car le mal ne lui serait pas exterieur, il lui semblerait tout naturel, ne se distinguerait meme pas d'elle; et la vertu, la memoire des morts, la tendresse filiale, comme elle n'en aurait pas le culte, elle ne trouverait pas un plaisir sacrilege a les profaner. Les sadiques de l'espece de Mlle Vinteuil sont des etre si purement sentimentaux, si naturellement vertueux que meme le plaisir sensuel leur parait quelque chose de mauvais, le privilege des mechants. Et quand ils se concedent a eux-memes de s'y livrer un moment, c'est dans la peau des mechants qu'ils tachent d'entrer et de faire entrer leur complice, de facon a avoir eu un moment l'illusion de s'etre evades de leur ame scrupuleuse et tendre, dans le monde inhumain du plaisir. Et je comprenais combien elle l'eut desire en voyant combien il lui etait impossible d'y reussir. Au moment ou elle se voulait si differente de son pere, ce qu'elle me rappelait c'etait les facons de penser, de dire, du vieux professeur de piano. Bien plus que sa photographie, ce qu'elle profanait, ce qu'elle faisait servir a ses plaisirs mais qui restait entre eux et elle et l'empechait de les gouter directement, c'etait la ressemblance de son visage, les yeux bleus de sa mere a lui qu'il lui avait transmis comme un bijou de famille, ces gestes d'amabilite qui interposaient entre le vice de Mlle Vinteuil et elle une phraseologie, une mentalite qui n'etait pas faite pour lui et l'empechait de le connaitre comme quelque chose de tres different des nombreux devoirs de politesse auxquels elle se consacrait d'habitude. Ce n'est pas le mal qui lui donnait l'idee du plaisir, qui lui semblait agreable; c'est le plaisir qui lui semblait malin. Et comme chaque fois qu'elle s'y adonnait il s'accompagnait pour elle de ces pensees mauvaises qui le reste du temps etaient absentes de son ame vertueuse, elle finissait par trouver au plaisir quelque chose de diabolique, par l'identifier au Mal. Peut-etre Mlle Vinteuil sentait-elle que son amie n'etait pas foncierement mauvaise, et qu'elle n'etait pas sincere au moment ou elle lui tenait ces propos blasphematoires. Du moins avait-elle le plaisir d'embrasser sur son visage, des sourires, des regards, feints peut-etre, mais analogues dans leur expression vicieuse et basse a ceux qu'aurait eus non un etre de bonte et de souffrance, mais un etre de cruaute et de plaisir. Elle pouvait s'imaginer un instant qu'elle jouait vraiment les jeux qu'eut joues avec une complice aussi denaturee, une fille qui aurait ressenti en effet ces sentiments barbares a l'egard de la memoire de son pere. Peut-etre n'eut-elle pas pense que le mal fut un etat si rare, si extraordinaire, si depaysant, ou il etait si reposant d'emigrer, si elle avait su discerner en elle comme en tout le monde, cette indifference aux souffrances qu'on cause et qui, quelques autres noms qu'on lui donne, est la forme terrible et permanente de la cruaute. S'il etait assez simple d'aller du cote de Meseglise, c'etait une autre affaire d'aller du cote de Guermantes, car la promenade etait longue et l'on voulait etre sur du temps qu'il ferait. Quand on semblait entrer dans une serie de beaux jours; quand Francoise desesperee qu'il ne tombat pas une goutte d'eau pour les pauvres recoltes, et ne voyant que de rares nuages blancs nageant a la surface calme et bleue du ciel s'ecriait en gemissant: Ne dirait-on pas qu'on voit ni plus ni moins des chiens de mer qui jouent en montrant la-haut leurs museaux? Ah! ils pensent bien a faire pleuvoir pour les pauvres laboureurs! Et puis quand les bles seront pousses, alors la pluie se mettra a tomber tout a petit patapon, sans discontinuer, sans plus savoir sur quoi elle tombe que si c'etait sur la mer; quand mon pere avait recu invariablement les memes reponses favorables du jardinier et du barometre, alors on disait au diner: Demain s'il fait le meme temps, nous irons du cote de Guermantes. On partait tout de suite apres dejeuner par la petite porte du jardin et on tombait dans la rue des Perchamps, etroite et formant un angle aigu, remplie de graminees au milieu desquelles deux ou trois guepes passaient la journee a herboriser, aussi bizarre que son nom d'ou me semblaient deriver ses particularites curieuses et sa personnalite reveche, et qu'on chercherait en vain dans le Combray d'aujourd'hui ou sur son trace ancien s'eleve l'ecole. Mais ma reverie (semblable a ces architectes eleves de Viollet-le-Duc, qui, croyant retrouver sous un jube Renaissance et un autel du XVIIe siecle les traces d'un chur roman, remettent tout l'edifice dans l'etat ou il devait etre au XIIe siecle) ne laisse pas une pierre du batiment nouveau, reperce et restitue la rue des Perchamps. Elle a d'ailleurs pour ces reconstitutions, des donnees plus precises que n'en ont generalement les restaurateurs: quelques images conservees par ma memoire, les dernieres peut-etre qui existent encore actuellement, et destinees a etre bientot aneanties, de ce qu'etait le Combray du temps de mon enfance; et parce que c'est lui-meme qui les a tracees en moi avant de disparaitre, emouvantes,--si on peut comparer un obscur portrait a ces effigies glorieuses dont ma grand'mere aimait a me donner des reproductions--comme ces gravures anciennes de la Cene ou ce tableau de Gentile Bellini dans lesquels l'on voit en un etat qui n'existe plus aujourd'hui le chef-d'uvre de Vinci et le portail de Saint-Marc. On passait, rue de l'Oiseau, devant la vieille hotellerie de l'Oiseau flesche dans la grande cour de laquelle entrerent quelquefois au XVIIe siecle les carrosses des duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes et de Montmorency quand elles avaient a venir a Combray pour quelque contestation avec leurs fermiers, pour une question d'hommage. On gagnait le mail entre les arbres duquel apparaissait le clocher de Saint-Hilaire. Et j'aurais voulu pouvoir m'asseoir la et rester toute la journee a lire en ecoutant les cloches; car il faisait si beau et si tranquille que, quand sonnait l'heure, on aurait dit non qu'elle rompait le calme du jour mais qu'elle le debarrassait de ce qu'il contenait et que le clocher avec l'exactitude indolente et soigneuse d'une personne qui n'a rien d'autre a faire, venait seulement--pour exprimer et laisser tomber les quelques gouttes d'or que la chaleur y avait lentement et naturellement amassees--de presser, au moment voulu, la plenitude du silence. Le plus grand charme du cote de Guermantes, c'est qu'on y avait presque tout le temps a cote de soi le cours de la Vivonne. On la traversait une premiere fois, dix minutes apres avoir quitte la maison, sur une passerelle dite le Pont-Vieux. Des le lendemain de notre arrivee, le jour de Paques, apres le sermon s'il faisait beau temps, je courais jusque-la, voir dans ce desordre d'un matin de grande fete ou quelques preparatifs somptueux font paraitre plus sordides les ustensiles de menage qui trainent encore, la riviere qui se promenait deja en bleu-ciel entre les terres encore noires et nues, accompagnee seulement d'une bande de coucous arrives trop tot et de primeveres en avance, cependant que ca et la une violette au bec bleu laissait flechir sa tige sous le poids de la goutte d'odeur qu'elle tenait dans son cornet. Le Pont-Vieux debouchait dans un sentier de halage qui a cet endroit se tapissait l'ete du feuillage bleu d'un noisetier sous lequel un pecheur en chapeau de paille avait pris racine.

"la seule personne dont je n'aie jamais decouvert l'identite. Il devait connaitre mes parents, car il soulevait son chapeau quand nous passions; je voulais alors demander son nom, mais on me faisait signe de me taire pour ne pas effrayer le poisson. Nous nous engagions dans le sentier de halage qui dominait le courant d'un talus de plusieurs pieds; de l'autre cote la rive etait basse, etendue en vastes pres jusqu'au village et jusqu'a la gare qui en etait distante. Ils etaient semes des restes, a demi enfouis dans l'herbe, du chateau des anciens comtes de Combray qui au moyen age avait de ce cote le cours de la Vivonne comme defense contre les attaques des sires de Guermantes et des abbes de Martinville. Ce n'etaient plus que quelques fragments de tours bossuant la prairie, a peine apparents, quelques creneaux d'ou jadis l'arbaletrier lancait des pierres, d'ou le guetteur surveillait Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt, toutes terres vassales de Guermantes entre lesquelles Combray etait enclave, aujourd'hui au ras de l'herbe, domines par les enfants de l'ecole des freres qui venaient la apprendre leurs lecons ou jouer aux recreations;--passe presque descendu dans la terre, couche au bord de l'eau comme un promeneur qui prend le frais, mais me donnant fort a songer, me faisant ajouter dans le nom de Combray a la petite ville d'aujourd'hui une cite tres differente, retenant mes pensees par son visage incomprehensible et d'autrefois qu'il cachait a demi sous les boutons d'or. Ils etaient fort nombreux a cet endroit qu'ils avaient choisi pour leurs jeux sur l'herbe, isoles, par couples, par troupes, jaunes comme un jaune d'uf, brillants d'autant plus, me semblait-il, que ne pouvant deriver vers aucune velleite de degustation le plaisir que leur vue me causait, je l'accumulais dans leur surface doree, jusqu'a ce qu'il devint assez puissant pour produire de l'inutile beaute; et cela des ma plus petite enfance, quand du sentier de halage je tendais les bras vers eux sans pouvoir epeler completement leur joli nom de Princes de contes de fees francais, venus peut-etre il y a bien des siecles d'Asie mais apatries pour toujours au village, contents du modeste horizon, aimant le soleil et le bord de l'eau, fideles a la petite vue de la gare, gardant encore pourtant comme certaines de nos vieilles toiles peintes, dans leur simplicite populaire, un poetique eclat d'orient. Je m'amusais a regarder les carafes que les gamins mettaient dans la Vivonne pour prendre les petits poissons, et qui, remplies par la riviere, ou elles sont a leur tour encloses, a la fois contenant aux flancs transparents comme une eau durcie, et contenu plonge dans un plus grand contenant de cristal liquide et courant, evoquaient l'image de la fraicheur d'une facon plus delicieuse et plus irritante qu'elles n'eussent fait sur une table servie, en ne la montrant qu'en fuite dans cette alliteration perpetuelle entre l'eau sans consistance ou les mains ne pouvaient la capter et le verre sans fluidite ou le palais ne pourrait en jouir. Je me promettais de venir la plus tard avec des lignes; j'obtenais qu'on tirat un peu de pain des provisions du gouter; j'en jetais dans la Vivonne des boulettes qui semblaient suffire pour y provoquer un phenomene de sursaturation, car l'eau se solidifiait aussitot autour d'elles en grappes ovoides de tetards inanities qu'elle tenait sans doute jusque-la en dissolution, invisibles, tout pres d'etre en voie de cristallisation. Bientot le cours de la Vivonne s'obstrue de plantes d'eau. Il y en a d'abord d'isolees comme tel nenufar a qui le courant au travers duquel il etait place d'une facon malheureuse laissait si peu de repos que comme un bac actionne mecaniquement il n'abordait une rive que pour retourner a celle d'ou il etait venu, refaisant eternellement la double traversee. Pousse vers la rive, son pedoncule se depliait, s'allongeait, filait, atteignait l'extreme limite de sa tension jusqu'au bord ou le courant le reprenait, le vert cordage se repliait sur lui-meme et ramenait la pauvre plante a ce qu'on peut d'autant mieux appeler son point de depart qu'elle n'y restait pas une seconde sans en repartir par une repetition de la meme manuvre. Je la retrouvais de promenade en promenade, toujours dans la meme situation, faisant penser a certains neurastheniques au nombre desquels mon grand-pere comptait ma tante Leonie, qui nous offrent sans changement au cours des annees le spectacle des habitudes bizarres qu'ils se croient chaque fois a la veille de secouer et qu'ils gardent toujours; pris dans l'engrenage de leurs malaises et de leurs manies, les efforts dans lesquels ils se debattent inutilement pour en sortir ne font qu'assurer le fonctionnement et faire jouer le declic de leur dietetique etrange, ineluctable et funeste. Tel etait ce nenufar, pareil aussi a quelqu'un de ces malheureux dont le tourment singulier, qui se repete indefiniment durant l'eternite, excitait la curiosite de Dante et dont il se serait fait raconter plus longuement les particularites et la cause par le supplicie lui-meme, si Virgile, s'eloignant a grands pas, ne l'avait force a le rattraper au plus vite, comme moi mes parents. Mais plus loin le courant se ralentit, il traverse une propriete dont l'acces etait ouvert au public par celui a qui elle appartenait et qui s'y etait complu a des travaux d'horticulture aquatique, faisant fleurir, dans les petits etangs que forme la Vivonne, de veritables jardins de nympheas. Comme les rives etaient a cet endroit tres boisees, les grandes ombres des arbres donnaient a l'eau un fond qui etait habituellement d'un vert sombre mais que parfois, quand nous rentrions par certains soirs rasserenes d'apres-midi orageux, j'ai vu d'un bleu clair et cru, tirant sur le violet, d'apparence cloisonnee et de gout japonais. Ca et la, a la surface, rougissait comme une fraise une fleur de nymphea au cur ecarlate, blanc sur les bords. Plus loin, les fleurs plus nombreuses etaient plus pales, moins lisses, plus grenues, plus plissees, et disposees par le hasard en enroulements si gracieux qu'on croyait voir flotter a la derive, comme apres l'effeuillement melancolique d'une fete galante, des roses mousseuses en guirlandes denouees. Ailleurs un coin semblait reserve aux especes communes qui montraient le blanc et rose proprets de la julienne, laves comme de la porcelaine avec un soin domestique, tandis qu'un peu plus loin, pressees les unes contre les autres en une veritable plate-bande flottante, on eut dit des pensees des jardins qui etaient venues poser comme des papillons leur ailes bleuatres et glacees, sur l'obliquite transparente de ce parterre d'eau; de ce parterre celeste aussi: car il donnait aux fleurs un sol d'une couleur plus precieuse, plus emouvante que la couleur des fleurs elles-memes; et, soit que pendant l'apres-midi il fit etinceler sous les nympheas le kaleidoscope d'un bonheur attentif, silencieux et mobile, ou qu'il s'emplit vers le soir, comme quelque port lointain, du rose et de la reverie du couchant, changeant sans cesse pour rester toujours en accord, autour des corolles de teintes plus fixes, avec ce qu'il y a de plus profond, de plus fugitif, de plus mysterieux,--avec ce qu'il y a d'infini,--dans l'heure, il semblait les avoir fait fleurir en plein ciel. Au sortir de ce parc, la Vivonne redevient courante. Que de fois j'ai vu, j'ai desire imiter quand je serais libre de vivre a ma guise, un rameur, qui, ayant lache l'aviron, s'etait couche a plat sur le dos, la tete en bas, au fond de sa barque, et la laissant flotter a la derive, ne pouvant voir que le ciel qui filait lentement au-dessus de lui, portait sur son visage l'avant-gout du bonheur et de la paix. Nous nous asseyions entre les iris au bord de l'eau. Dans le ciel ferie, flanait longuement un nuage oisif. Par moments oppressee par l'ennui, une carpe se dressait hors de l'eau dans une aspiration anxieuse. C'etait l'heure du gouter. Avant de repartir nous restions longtemps a manger des fruits, du pain et du chocolat, sur l'herbe ou parvenaient jusqu'a nous, horizontaux, affaiblis, mais denses et metalliques encore, des sons de la cloche de Saint-Hilaire qui ne s'etaient pas melanges a l'air qu'ils traversaient depuis si longtemps, et coteles par la palpitation successive de toutes leurs lignes sonores, vibraient en rasant les fleurs, a nos pieds. Parfois, au bord de l'eau entouree de bois, nous rencontrions une maison dite de plaisance, isolee, perdue, qui ne voyait rien, du monde, que la riviere qui baignait ses pieds. Une jeune femme dont le visage pensif et les voiles elegants n'etaient pas de ce pays et qui sans doute etait venue, selon l'expression populaire s'enterrer la, gouter le plaisir amer de sentir que son nom, le nom surtout de celui dont elle n'avait pu garder le cur, y etait inconnu, s'encadrait dans la fenetre qui ne lui laissait pas regarder plus loin que la barque amarree pres de la porte. Elle levait distraitement les yeux en entendant derriere les arbres de la rive la voix des passants dont avant qu'elle eut apercu leur visage, elle pouvait etre certaine que jamais ils n'avaient connu, ni ne connaitraient l'infidele, que rien dans leur passe ne gardait sa marque, que rien dans leur avenir n'aurait l'occasion de la recevoir. On sentait que, dans son renoncement, elle avait volontairement quitte des lieux ou elle aurait pu du moins apercevoir celui qu'elle aimait, pour ceux-ci qui ne l'avaient jamais vu. Et je la regardais, revenant de quelque promenade sur un chemin ou elle savait qu'il ne passerait pas, oter de ses mains resignees de longs gants d'une grace inutile. Jamais dans la promenade du cote de Guermantes nous ne pumes remonter jusqu'aux sources de la Vivonne, auxquelles j'avais souvent pense et qui avaient pour moi une existence si abstraite, si ideale, que j'avais ete aussi surpris quand on m'avait dit qu'elles se trouvaient dans le departement, a une certaine distance kilometrique de Combray, que le jour ou j'avais appris qu'il y avait un autre point precis de la terre ou s'ouvrait, dans l'antiquite, l'entree des Enfers.

"Mais en meme temps, sur cette image que le nez proeminent, les yeux percants, epinglaient dans ma vision (peut-etre parce que c'etait eux qui l'avaient d'abord atteinte, qui y avaient fait la premiere encoche, au moment ou je n'avais pas encore le temps de songer que la femme qui apparaissait devant moi pouvait etre Mme de Guermantes), sur cette image toute recente, inchangeable, j'essayais d'appliquer l'idee: C'est Mme de Guermantes sans parvenir qu'a la faire manuvrer en face de l'image, comme deux disques separes par un intervalle. Mais cette Mme de Guermantes a laquelle j'avais si souvent reve, maintenant que je voyais qu'elle existait effectivement en dehors de moi, en prit plus de puissance encore sur mon imagination qui, un moment paralysee au contact d'une realite si differente de ce qu'elle attendait, se mit a reagir et a me dire: Glorieux des avant Charlemagne, les Guermantes avaient le droit de vie et de mort sur leurs vassaux; la duchesse de Guermantes descend de Genevieve de Brabant. Elle ne connait, ni ne consentirait a connaitre aucune des personnes qui sont ici. Et--o merveilleuse independance des regards humains, retenus au visage par une corde si lache, si longue, si extensible qu'ils peuvent se promener seuls loin de lui--pendant que Mme de Guermantes etait assise dans la chapelle au-dessus des tombes de ses morts, ses regards flanaient ca et la, montaient le long des piliers, s'arretaient meme sur moi comme un rayon de soleil errant dans la nef, mais un rayon de soleil qui, au moment ou je recus sa caresse, me sembla conscient. Quant a Mme de Guermantes elle-meme, comme elle restait immobile, assise comme une mere qui semble ne pas voir les audaces espiegles et les entreprises indiscretes de ses enfants qui jouent et interpellent des personnes qu'elle ne connait pas, il me fut impossible de savoir si elle approuvait ou blamait dans le desuvrement de son ame, le vagabondage de ses regards. Je trouvais important qu'elle ne partit pas avant que j'eusse pu la regarder suffisamment, car je me rappelais que depuis des annees je considerais sa vue comme eminemment desirable, et je ne detachais pas mes yeux d'elle, comme si chacun de mes regards eut pu materiellement emporter et mettre en reserve en moi le souvenir du nez proeminent, des joues rouges, de toutes ces particularites qui me semblaient autant de renseignements precieux, authentiques et singuliers sur son visage. Maintenant que me le faisaient trouver beau toutes les pensees que j'y rapportais--et peut-etre surtout, forme de l'instinct de conservation des meilleures parties de nous-memes, ce desir qu'on a toujours de ne pas avoir ete decu,--la replacant (puisque c'etait une seule personne qu'elle et cette duchesse de Guermantes que j'avais evoquee jusque-la) hors du reste de l'humanite dans laquelle la vue pure et simple de son corps me l'avait fait un instant confondre, je m'irritais en entendant dire autour de moi: Elle est mieux que Mme Sazerat, que Mlle Vinteuil, comme si elle leur eut ete comparable. Et mes regards s'arretant a ses cheveux blonds, a ses yeux bleus, a l'attache de son cou et omettant les traits qui eussent pu me rappeler d'autres visages, je m'ecriais devant ce croquis volontairement incomplet: Qu'elle est belle! Quelle noblesse! Comme c'est bien une fiere Guermantes, la descendante de Genevieve de Brabant, que j'ai devant moi! Et l'attention avec laquelle j'eclairais son visage l'isolait tellement, qu'aujourd'hui si je repense a cette ceremonie, il m'est impossible de revoir une seule des personnes qui y assistaient sauf elle et le suisse qui repondit affirmativement quand je lui demandai si cette dame etait bien Mme de Guermantes. Mais elle, je la revois, surtout au moment du defile dans la sacristie qu'eclairait le soleil intermittent et chaud d'un jour de vent et d'orage, et dans laquelle Mme de Guermantes se trouvait au milieu de tous ces gens de Combray dont elle ne savait meme pas les noms, mais dont l'inferiorite proclamait trop sa suprematie pour qu'elle ne ressentit pas pour eux une sincere bienveillance et auxquels du reste elle esperait imposer davantage encore a force de bonne grace et de simplicite. Aussi, ne pouvant emettre ces regards volontaires, charges d'une signification precise, qu'on adresse a quelqu'un qu'on connait, mais seulement laisser ses pensees distraites s'echapper incessamment devant elle en un flot de lumiere bleue qu'elle ne pouvait contenir, elle ne voulait pas qu'il put gener, paraitre dedaigner ces petites gens qu'il rencontrait au passage, qu'il atteignait a tous moments. Je revois encore, au-dessus de sa cravate mauve, soyeuse et gonflee, le doux etonnement de ses yeux auxquels elle avait ajoute sans oser le destiner a personne mais pour que tous pussent en prendre leur part un sourire un peu timide de suzeraine qui a l'air de s'excuser aupres de ses vassaux et de les aimer. Ce sourire tomba sur moi qui ne la quittais pas des yeux. Alors me rappelant ce regard qu'elle avait laisse s'arreter sur moi, pendant la messe, bleu comme un rayon de soleil qui aurait traverse le vitrail de Gilbert le Mauvais, je me dis: Mais sans doute elle fait attention a moi. Je crus que je lui plaisais, qu'elle penserait encore a moi quand elle aurait quitte l'eglise, qu'a cause de moi elle serait peut-etre triste le soir a Guermantes. Et aussitot je l'aimai, car s'il peut quelquefois suffire pour que nous aimions une femme qu'elle nous regarde avec mepris comme j'avais cru qu'avait fait Mlle Swann et que nous pensions qu'elle ne pourra jamais nous appartenir, quelquefois aussi il peut suffire qu'elle nous regarde avec bonte comme faisait Mme de Guermantes et que nous pensions qu'elle pourra nous appartenir. Ses yeux bleuissaient comme une pervenche impossible a cueillir et que pourtant elle m'eut dediee; et le soleil menace par un nuage, mais dardant encore de toute sa force sur la place et dans la sacristie, donnait une carnation de geranium aux tapis rouges qu'on y avait etendus par terre pour la solennite et sur lesquels s'avancait en souriant Mme de Guermantes, et ajoutait a leur lainage un veloute rose, un epiderme de lumiere, cette sorte de tendresse, de serieuse douceur dans la pompe et dans la joie qui caracterisent certaines pages de Lohengrin, certaines peintures de Carpaccio, et qui font comprendre que Baudelaire ait pu appliquer au son de la trompette l'epithete de delicieux. Combien depuis ce jour, dans mes promenades du cote de Guermantes, il me parut plus affligeant encore qu'auparavant de n'avoir pas de dispositions pour les lettres, et de devoir renoncer a etre jamais un ecrivain celebre. Les regrets que j'en eprouvais, tandis que je restais seul a rever un peu a l'ecart, me faisaient tant souffrir, que pour ne plus les ressentir, de lui-meme par une sorte d'inhibition devant la douleur, mon esprit s'arretait entierement de penser aux vers, aux romans, a un avenir poetique sur lequel mon manque de talent m'interdisait de compter. Alors, bien en dehors de toutes ces preoccupations litteraires et ne s'y rattachant en rien, tout d'un coup un toit, un reflet de soleil sur une pierre, l'odeur d'un chemin me faisaient arreter par un plaisir particulier qu'ils me donnaient, et aussi parce qu'ils avaient l'air de cacher au dela de ce que je voyais, quelque chose qu'ils invitaient a venir prendre et que malgre mes efforts je n'arrivais pas a decouvrir. Comme je sentais que cela se trouvait en eux, je restais la, immobile, a regarder, a respirer, a tacher d'aller avec ma pensee au dela de l'image ou de l'odeur. Et s'il me fallait rattraper mon grand-pere, poursuivre ma route, je cherchais a les retrouver, en fermant les yeux; je m'attachais a me rappeler exactement la ligne du toit, la nuance de la pierre qui, sans que je pusse comprendre pourquoi, m'avaient semble pleines, pretes a s'entr'ouvrir, a me livrer ce dont elles n'etaient qu'un couvercle. Certes ce n'etait pas des impressions de ce genre qui pouvaient me rendre l'esperance que j'avais perdue de pouvoir etre un jour ecrivain et poete, car elles etaient toujours liees a un objet particulier depourvu de valeur intellectuelle et ne se rapportant a aucune verite abstraite. Mais du moins elles me donnaient un plaisir irraisonne, l'illusion d'une sorte de fecondite et par la me distrayaient de l'ennui, du sentiment de mon impuissance que j'avais eprouves chaque fois que j'avais cherche un sujet philosophique pour une grande uvre litteraire. Mais le devoir de conscience etait si ardu que m'imposaient ces impressions de forme, de parfum ou de couleur--de tacher d'apercevoir ce qui se cachait derriere elles, que je ne tardais pas a me chercher a moi-meme des excuses qui me permissent de me derober a ces efforts et de m'epargner cette fatigue. Par bonheur mes parents m'appelaient, je sentais que je n'avais pas presentement la tranquillite necessaire pour poursuivre utilement ma recherche, et qu'il valait mieux n'y plus penser jusqu'a ce que je fusse rentre, et ne pas me fatiguer d'avance sans resultat. Alors je ne m'occupais plus de cette chose inconnue qui s'enveloppait d'une forme ou d'un parfum, bien tranquille puisque je la ramenais a la maison, protegee par le revetement d'images sous lesquelles je la trouverais vivante, comme les poissons que les jours ou on m'avait laisse aller a la peche, je rapportais dans mon panier couverts par une couche d'herbe qui preservait leur fraicheur. Une fois a la maison je songeais a autre chose et ainsi s'entassaient dans mon esprit (comme dans ma chambre les fleurs que j'avais cueillies dans mes promenades ou les objets qu'on m'avait donnes), une pierre ou jouait un reflet, un toit, un son de cloche, une odeur de feuilles, bien des images differentes sous lesquelles il y a longtemps qu'est morte la realite pressentie que je n'ai pas eu assez de volonte pour arriver a decouvrir. Une fois pourtant,--ou notre promenade s'etant prolongee fort au dela de sa duree habituelle, nous avions ete bien heureux de rencontrer a mi-chemin du retour, comme l'apres-midi finissait, le docteur Percepied qui passait",4.835721338176297,1.3275296001611006,0.32848354802353824,0.0826957920562126,4.688387096774194,4.0,2.803970798216854,48.4375,50.5,24.667713589832356,1.3490322580645162,1.0,0.674021895110574,1550,627,0.4045161290322581,8436,32,22.313528438300594,4905036828.53054,2628637.099962776,0.8517065783662181,0.8298586154977481,43.54280846774195,19.219205645161292,13.575384162921281,22.13629032258065,24.871053225806456,11.15661935483871,73.98588709677419,12.375,True,76.0,0.9008574490889604,4.520900321543408,1866.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01624405705229794,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.015451664025356577,0.015154516640253565,0.0053486529318541995,0.1489817792068596,41,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"non plus nous ne pumes pousser jusqu'au terme que j'eusse tant souhaite d'atteindre, jusqu'a Guermantes. Je savais que la residaient des chatelains, le duc et la duchesse de Guermantes, je savais qu'ils etaient des personnages reels et actuellement existants, mais chaque fois que je pensais a eux, je me les representais tantot en tapisserie, comme etait la comtesse de Guermantes, dans le Couronnement d'Esther de notre eglise, tantot de nuances changeantes comme etait Gilbert le Mauvais dans le vitrail ou il passait du vert chou au bleu prune selon que j'etais encore a prendre de l'eau benite ou que j'arrivais a nos chaises, tantot tout a fait impalpables comme l'image de Genevieve de Brabant, ancetre de la famille de Guermantes, que la lanterne magique promenait sur les rideaux de ma chambre ou faisait monter au plafond,--enfin toujours enveloppes du mystere des temps merovingiens et baignant comme dans un coucher de soleil dans la lumiere orangee qui emane de cette syllabe: antes. Mais si malgre cela ils etaient pour moi, en tant que duc et duchesse, des etres reels, bien qu'etranges, en revanche leur personne ducale se distendait demesurement, s'immaterialisait, pour pouvoir contenir en elle ce Guermantes dont ils etaient duc et duchesse, tout ce cote de Guermantes ensoleille, le cours de la Vivonne, ses nympheas et ses grands arbres, et tant de beaux apres-midi. Et je savais qu'ils ne portaient pas seulement le titre de duc et de duchesse de Guermantes, mais que depuis le XIVe siecle ou, apres avoir inutilement essaye de vaincre leurs anciens seigneurs ils s'etaient allies a eux par des mariages, ils etaient comtes de Combray, les premiers des citoyens de Combray par consequent et pourtant les seuls qui n'y habitassent pas. Comtes de Combray, possedant Combray au milieu de leur nom, de leur personne, et sans doute ayant effectivement en eux cette etrange et pieuse tristesse qui etait speciale a Combray; proprietaires de la ville, mais non d'une maison particuliere, demeurant sans doute dehors, dans la rue, entre ciel et terre, comme ce Gilbert de Guermantes, dont je ne voyais aux vitraux de l'abside de Saint-Hilaire que l'envers de laque noire, si je levais la tete quand j'allais chercher du sel chez Camus. Puis il arriva que sur le cote de Guermantes je passai parfois devant de petits enclos humides ou montaient des grappes de fleurs sombres. Je m'arretais, croyant acquerir une notion precieuse, car il me semblait avoir sous les yeux un fragment de cette region fluviatile, que je desirais tant connaitre depuis que je l'avais vue decrite par un de mes ecrivains preferes. Et ce fut avec elle, avec son sol imaginaire traverse de cours d'eau bouillonnants, que Guermantes, changeant d'aspect dans ma pensee, s'identifia, quand j'eus entendu le docteur Percepied nous parler des fleurs et des belles eaux vives qu'il y avait dans le parc du chateau. Je revais que Mme de Guermantes m'y faisait venir, eprise pour moi d'un soudain caprice; tout le jour elle y pechait la truite avec moi. Et le soir me tenant par la main, en passant devant les petits jardins de ses vassaux, elle me montrait le long des murs bas, les fleurs qui y appuient leurs quenouilles violettes et rouges et m'apprenait leurs noms. Elle me faisait lui dire le sujet des poemes que j'avais l'intention de composer. Et ces reves m'avertissaient que puisque je voulais un jour etre un ecrivain, il etait temps de savoir ce que je comptais ecrire. Mais des que je me le demandais, tachant de trouver un sujet ou je pusse faire tenir une signification philosophique infinie, mon esprit s'arretait de fonctionner, je ne voyais plus que le vide en face de mon attention, je sentais que je n'avais pas de genie ou peut-etre une maladie cerebrale l'empechait de naitre. Parfois je comptais sur mon pere pour arranger cela. Il etait si puissant, si en faveur aupres des gens en place qu'il arrivait a nous faire transgresser les lois que Francoise m'avait appris a considerer comme plus ineluctables que celles de la vie et de la mort, a faire retarder d'un an pour notre maison, seule de tout le quartier, les travaux de ravalement, a obtenir du ministre pour le fils de Mme Sazerat qui voulait aller aux eaux, l'autorisation qu'il passat le baccalaureat deux mois d'avance, dans la serie des candidats dont le nom commencait par un A au lieu d'attendre le tour des S. Si j'etais tombe gravement malade, si j'avais ete capture par des brigands, persuade que mon pere avait trop d'intelligences avec les puissances supremes, de trop irresistibles lettres de recommandation aupres du bon Dieu, pour que ma maladie ou ma captivite pussent etre autre chose que de vains simulacres sans danger pour moi, j'aurais attendu avec calme l'heure inevitable du retour a la bonne realite, l'heure de la delivrance ou de la guerison; peut-etre cette absence de genie, ce trou noir qui se creusait dans mon esprit quand je cherchais le sujet de mes ecrits futurs, n'etait-il aussi qu'une illusion sans consistance, et cesserait-elle par l'intervention de mon pere qui avait du convenir avec le Gouvernement et avec la Providence que je serais le premier ecrivain de l'epoque. Mais d'autres fois tandis que mes parents s'impatientaient de me voir rester en arriere et ne pas les suivre, ma vie actuelle au lieu de me sembler une creation artificielle de mon pere et qu'il pouvait modifier a son gre, m'apparaissait au contraire comme comprise dans une realite qui n'etait pas faite pour moi, contre laquelle il n'y avait pas de recours, au cur de laquelle je n'avais pas d'allie, qui ne cachait rien au dela d'elle-meme. Il me semblait alors que j'existais de la meme facon que les autres hommes, que je vieillirais, que je mourrais comme eux, et que parmi eux j'etais seulement du nombre de ceux qui n'ont pas de dispositions pour ecrire. Aussi, decourage, je renoncais a jamais a la litterature, malgre les encouragements que m'avait donnes Bloch. Ce sentiment intime, immediat, que j'avais du neant de ma pensee, prevalait contre toutes les paroles flatteuses qu'on pouvait me prodiguer, comme chez un mechant dont chacun vante les bonnes actions, les remords de sa conscience. Un jour ma mere me dit: Puisque tu parles toujours de Mme de Guermantes, comme le docteur Percepied l'a tres bien soignee il y a quatre ans, elle doit venir a Combray pour assister au mariage de sa fille. Tu pourras l'apercevoir a la ceremonie. C'etait du reste par le docteur Percepied que j'avais le plus entendu parler de Mme de Guermantes, et il nous avait meme montre le numero d'une revue illustree ou elle etait representee dans le costume qu'elle portait a un bal travesti chez la princesse de Leon. Tout d'un coup pendant la messe de mariage, un mouvement que fit le suisse en se deplacant me permit de voir assise dans une chapelle une dame blonde avec un grand nez, des yeux bleus et percants, une cravate bouffante en soie mauve, lisse, neuve et brillante, et un petit bouton au coin du nez. Et parce que dans la surface de son visage rouge, comme si elle eut eu tres chaud, je distinguais, diluees et a peine perceptibles, des parcelles d'analogie avec le portrait qu'on m'avait montre, parce que surtout les traits particuliers que je relevais en elle, si j'essayais de les enoncer, se formulaient precisement dans les memes termes: un grand nez, des yeux bleus, dont s'etait servi le docteur Percepied quand il avait decrit devant moi la duchesse de Guermantes, je me dis: cette dame ressemble a Mme de Guermantes; or la chapelle ou elle suivait la messe etait celle de Gilbert le Mauvais, sous les plates tombes de laquelle, dorees et distendues comme des alveoles de miel, reposaient les anciens comtes de Brabant, et que je me rappelais etre a ce qu'on m'avait dit reservee a la famille de Guermantes quand quelqu'un de ses membres venait pour une ceremonie a Combray; il ne pouvait vraisemblablement y avoir qu'une seule femme ressemblant au portrait de Mme de Guermantes, qui fut ce jour-la, jour ou elle devait justement venir, dans cette chapelle: c'etait elle! Ma deception etait grande. Elle provenait de ce que je n'avais jamais pris garde quand je pensais a Mme de Guermantes, que je me la representais avec les couleurs d'une tapisserie ou d'un vitrail, dans un autre siecle, d'une autre matiere que le reste des personnes vivantes. Jamais je ne m'etais avise qu'elle pouvait avoir une figure rouge, une cravate mauve comme Mme Sazerat, et l'ovale de ses joues me fit tellement souvenir de personnes que j'avais vues a la maison que le soupcon m'effleura, pour se dissiper d'ailleurs aussitot apres, que cette dame en son principe generateur, en toutes ses molecules, n'etait peut-etre pas substantiellement la duchesse de Guermantes, mais que son corps, ignorant du nom qu'on lui appliquait, appartenait a un certain type feminin, qui comprenait aussi des femmes de medecins et de commercants. C'est cela, ce n'est que cela, Mme de Guermantes! disait la mine attentive et etonnee avec laquelle je contemplais cette image qui naturellement n'avait aucun rapport avec celles qui sous le meme nom de Mme de Guermantes etaient apparues tant de fois dans mes songes, puisque, elle, elle n'avait pas ete comme les autres arbitrairement formee par moi, mais qu'elle m'avait saute aux yeux pour la premiere fois il y a un moment seulement, dans l'eglise; qui n'etait pas de la meme nature, n'etait pas colorable a volonte comme elles qui se laissaient imbiber de la teinte orangee d'une syllabe, mais etait si reelle que tout, jusqu'a ce petit bouton qui s'enflammait au coin du nez, certifiait son assujettissement aux lois de la vie, comme dans une apotheose de theatre, un plissement de la robe de la fee, un tremblement de son petit doigt, denoncent la presence materielle d'une actrice vivante, la ou nous etions incertains si nous n'avions pas devant les yeux une simple projection lumineuse.",3.9309934118606122,2.0170492150792105,0.3153928805031504,0.10772480756849687,4.610223642172524,4.0,2.717619285803668,39.125,35.5,34.57469269566976,1.3015974440894569,1.0,0.6342946606609486,1565,617,0.39424920127795526,8233,40,22.346313325643926,5068513040.543484,2720618.9160190467,0.7060768107573191,0.6693985738154304,57.00798123003197,15.027599840255593,11.65048021390901,17.92476038338658,19.846653354632586,10.551565495207665,63.08666134185303,9.375,True,53.0,0.8990874932903918,4.4192163177670425,1863.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.024663903770342666,0.017992519963610634,0.0056605680784393006,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.023653088042049936,0.015566562215708077,0.009299504700293136,0.15029522275899088,40,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"a accompagner leur souvenir de son visage inconscient ou distrait; et certes quand ils etaient longuement contemples par cet humble passant, par cet enfant qui revait,--comme l'est un roi, par un memorialiste perdu dans la foule,--ce coin de nature, ce bout de jardin n'eussent pu penser que ce serait grace a lui qu'ils seraient appeles a survivre en leurs particularites les plus ephemeres; et pourtant ce parfum d'aubepine qui butine le long de la haie ou les eglantiers le remplaceront bientot, un bruit de pas sans echo sur le gravier d'une allee, une bulle formee contre une plante aquatique par l'eau de la riviere et qui creve aussitot, mon exaltation les a portes et a reussi a leur faire traverser tant d'annees successives, tandis qu'alentour les chemins se sont effaces et que sont morts ceux qui les foulerent et le souvenir de ceux qui les foulerent. Parfois ce morceau de paysage amene ainsi jusqu'a aujourd'hui se detache si isole de tout, qu'il flotte incertain dans ma pensee comme une Delos fleurie, sans que je puisse dire de quel pays, de quel temps--peut-etre tout simplement de quel reve--il vient. Mais c'est surtout comme a des gisements profonds de mon sol mental, comme aux terrains resistants sur lesquels je m'appuie encore, que je dois penser au cote de Meseglise et au cote de Guermantes. C'est parce que je croyais aux choses, aux etres, tandis que je les parcourais, que les choses, les etres qu'ils m'ont fait connaitre, sont les seuls que je prenne encore au serieux et qui me donnent encore de la joie. Soit que la foi qui cree soit tarie en moi, soit que la realite ne se forme que dans la memoire, les fleurs qu'on me montre aujourd'hui pour la premiere fois ne me semblent pas de vraies fleurs. Le cote de Meseglise avec ses lilas, ses aubepines, ses bluets, ses coquelicots, ses pommiers, le cote de Guermantes avec sa riviere a tetards, ses nympheas et ses boutons d'or, ont constitue a tout jamais pour moi la figure des pays ou j'aimerais vivre, ou j'exige avant tout qu'on puisse aller a la peche, se promener en canot, voir des ruines de fortifications gothiques et trouver au milieu des bles, ainsi qu'etait Saint-Andre-des-Champs, une eglise monumentale, rustique et doree comme une meule; et les bluets, les aubepines, les pommiers qu'il m'arrive quand je voyage de rencontrer encore dans les champs, parce qu'ils sont situes a la meme profondeur, au niveau de mon passe, sont immediatement en communication avec mon cur. Et pourtant, parce qu'il y a quelque chose d'individuel dans les lieux, quand me saisit le desir de revoir le cote de Guermantes, on ne le satisferait pas en me menant au bord d'une riviere ou il y aurait d'aussi beaux, de plus beaux nympheas que dans la Vivonne, pas plus que le soir en rentrant,--a l'heure ou s'eveillait en moi cette angoisse qui plus tard emigre dans l'amour, et peut devenir a jamais inseparable de lui--, je n'aurais souhaite que vint me dire bonsoir une mere plus belle et plus intelligente que la mienne. Non; de meme que ce qu'il me fallait pour que je pusse m'endormir heureux, avec cette paix sans trouble qu'aucune maitresse n'a pu me donner depuis puisqu'on doute d'elles encore au moment ou on croit en elles, et qu'on ne possede jamais leur cur comme je recevais dans un baiser celui de ma mere, tout entier, sans la reserve d'une arriere-pensee, sans le reliquat d'une intention qui ne fut pas pour moi,--c'est que ce fut elle, c'est qu'elle inclinat vers moi ce visage ou il y avait au-dessous de l'il quelque chose qui etait, parait-il, un defaut, et que j'aimais a l'egal du reste, de meme ce que je veux revoir, c'est le cote de Guermantes que j'ai connu, avec la ferme qui est peu eloignee des deux suivantes serrees l'une contre l'autre, a l'entree de l'allee des chenes; ce sont ces prairies ou, quand le soleil les rend reflechissantes comme une mare, se dessinent les feuilles des pommiers, c'est ce paysage dont parfois, la nuit dans mes reves, l'individualite m'etreint avec une puissance presque fantastique et que je ne peux plus retrouver au reveil. Sans doute pour avoir a jamais indissolublement uni en moi des impressions differentes rien que parce qu'ils me les avaient fait eprouver en meme temps, le cote de Meseglise ou le cote de Guermantes m'ont expose, pour l'avenir, a bien des deceptions et meme a bien des fautes. Car souvent j'ai voulu revoir une personne sans discerner que c'etait simplement parce qu'elle me rappelait une haie d'aubepines, et j'ai ete induit a croire, a faire croire a un regain d'affection, par un simple desir de voyage. Mais par la meme aussi, et en restant presents en celles de mes impressions d'aujourd'hui auxquelles ils peuvent se relier, ils leur donnent des assises, de la profondeur, une dimension de plus qu'aux autres. Ils leur ajoutent aussi un charme, une signification qui n'est que pour moi. Quand par les soirs d'ete le ciel harmonieux gronde comme une bete fauve et que chacun boude l'orage, c'est au cote de Meseglise que je dois de rester seul en extase a respirer, a travers le bruit de la pluie qui tombe, l'odeur d'invisibles et persistants lilas. C'est ainsi que je restais souvent jusqu'au matin a songer au temps de Combray, a mes tristes soirees sans sommeil, a tant de jours aussi dont l'image m'avait ete plus recemment rendue par la saveur--ce qu'on aurait appele a Combray le parfum--d'une tasse de the, et par association de souvenirs a ce que, bien des annees apres avoir quitte cette petite ville, j'avais appris, au sujet d'un amour que Swann avait eu avant ma naissance, avec cette precision dans les details plus facile a obtenir quelquefois pour la vie de personnes mortes il y a des siecles que pour celle de nos meilleurs amis, et qui semble impossible comme semblait impossible de causer d'une ville a une autre--tant qu'on ignore le biais par lequel cette impossibilite a ete tournee. Tous ces souvenirs ajoutes les uns aux autres ne formaient plus qu'une masse, mais non sans qu'on ne put distinguer entre eux,--entre les plus anciens, et ceux plus recents, nes d'un parfum, puis ceux qui n'etaient que les souvenirs d'une autre personne de qui je les avais appris-- sinon des fissures, des failles veritables, du moins ces veinures, ces bigarrures de coloration, qui dans certaines roches, dans certains marbres, revelent des differences d'origine, d'age, de formation. Certes quand approchait le matin, il y avait bien longtemps qu'etait dissipee la breve incertitude de mon reveil. Je savais dans quelle chambre je me trouvais effectivement, je l'avais reconstruite autour de moi dans l'obscurite, et,--soit en m'orientant par la seule memoire, soit en m'aidant, comme indication, d'une faible lueur apercue, au pied de laquelle je placais les rideaux de la croisee--, je l'avais reconstruite tout entiere et meublee comme un architecte et un tapissier qui gardent leur ouverture primitive aux fenetres et aux portes, j'avais repose les glaces et remis la commode a sa place habituelle. Mais a peine le jour--et non plus le reflet d'une derniere braise sur une tringle de cuivre que j'avais pris pour lui--tracait-il dans l'obscurite, et comme a la craie, sa premiere raie blanche et rectificative, que la fenetre avec ses rideaux, quittait le cadre de la porte ou je l'avais situee par erreur, tandis que pour lui faire place, le bureau que ma memoire avait maladroitement installe la se sauvait a toute vitesse, poussant devant lui la cheminee et ecartant le mur mitoyen du couloir; une courette regnait a l'endroit ou il y a un instant encore s'etendait le cabinet de toilette, et la demeure que j'avais rebatie dans les tenebres etait allee rejoindre les demeures entrevues dans le tourbillon du reveil, mise en fuite par ce pale signe qu'avait trace au-dessus des rideaux le doigt leve du jour. Pour faire partie du petit noyau, du petit groupe, du petit clan des Verdurin, une condition etait suffisante mais elle etait necessaire: il fallait adherer tacitement a un Credo dont un des articles etait que le jeune pianiste, protege par Mme Verdurin cette annee-la et dont elle disait: Ca ne devrait pas etre permis de savoir jouer Wagner comme ca!, enfoncait a la fois Plante et Rubinstein et que le docteur Cottard avait plus de diagnostic que Potain. Toute nouvelle recrue a qui les Verdurin ne pouvaient pas persuader que les soirees des gens qui n'allaient pas chez eux etaient ennuyeuses comme la pluie, se voyait immediatement exclue. Les femmes etant a cet egard plus rebelles que les hommes a deposer toute curiosite mondaine et l'envie de se renseigner par soi-meme sur l'agrement des autres salons, et les Verdurin sentant d'autre part que cet esprit d'examen et ce demon de frivolite pouvaient par contagion devenir fatal a l'orthodoxie de la petite eglise, ils avaient ete amenes a rejeter successivement tous les fideles du sexe feminin. En dehors de la jeune femme du docteur, ils etaient reduits presque uniquement cette annee-la (bien que Mme Verdurin fut elle-meme vertueuse et d'une respectable famille bourgeoise excessivement riche et entierement obscure avec laquelle elle avait peu a peu cesse volontairement toute relation) a une personne presque du demi-monde, Mme de Crecy, que Mme Verdurin appelait par son petit nom, Odette, et declarait etre un amour et a la tante du pianiste, laquelle devait avoir tire le cordon; personnes ignorantes du monde et a la naivete de qui il avait ete si facile de faire accroire que la princesse de Sagan et la duchesse de Guermantes etaient obligees de payer des malheureux pour avoir du monde a leurs diners, que si on leur avait offert de les faire inviter chez ces deux grandes dames, l'ancienne concierge et la cocotte eussent dedaigneusement refuse. Les Verdurin n'invitaient pas a diner: on avait chez eux son couvert mis. Pour la soiree, il n'y avait pas de programme.

"en voiture a bride abattue, nous avait reconnus et fait monter avec lui,--j'eus une impression de ce genre et ne l'abandonnai pas sans un peu l'approfondir. On m'avait fait monter pres du cocher, nous allions comme le vent parce que le docteur avait encore avant de rentrer a Combray a s'arreter a Martinville-le-Sec chez un malade a la porte duquel il avait ete convenu que nous l'attendrions. Au tournant d'un chemin j'eprouvai tout a coup ce plaisir special qui ne ressemblait a aucun autre, a apercevoir les deux clochers de Martinville, sur lesquels donnait le soleil couchant et que le mouvement de notre voiture et les lacets du chemin avaient l'air de faire changer de place, puis celui de Vieuxvicq qui, separe d'eux par une colline et une vallee, et situe sur un plateau plus eleve dans le lointain, semblait pourtant tout voisin d'eux. En constatant, en notant la forme de leur fleche, le deplacement de leurs lignes, l'ensoleillement de leur surface, je sentais que je n'allais pas au bout de mon impression, que quelque chose etait derriere ce mouvement, derriere cette clarte, quelque chose qu'ils semblaient contenir et derober a la fois. Les clochers paraissaient si eloignes et nous avions l'air de si peu nous rapprocher d'eux, que je fus etonne quand, quelques instants apres, nous nous arretames devant l'eglise de Martinville. Je ne savais pas la raison du plaisir que j'avais eu a les apercevoir a l'horizon et l'obligation de chercher a decouvrir cette raison me semblait bien penible; j'avais envie de garder en reserve dans ma tete ces lignes remuantes au soleil et de n'y plus penser maintenant. Et il est probable que si je l'avais fait, les deux clochers seraient alles a jamais rejoindre tant d'arbres, de toits, de parfums, de sons, que j'avais distingues des autres a cause de ce plaisir obscur qu'ils m'avaient procure et que je n'ai jamais approfondi. Je descendis causer avec mes parents en attendant le docteur. Puis nous repartimes, je repris ma place sur le siege, je tournai la tete pour voir encore les clochers qu'un peu plus tard, j'apercus une derniere fois au tournant d'un chemin. Le cocher, qui ne semblait pas dispose a causer, ayant a peine repondu a mes propos, force me fut, faute d'autre compagnie, de me rabattre sur celle de moi-meme et d'essayer de me rappeler mes clochers. Bientot leurs lignes et leurs surfaces ensoleillees, comme si elles avaient ete une sorte d'ecorce, se dechirerent, un peu de ce qui m'etait cache en elles m'apparut, j'eus une pensee qui n'existait pas pour moi l'instant avant, qui se formula en mots dans ma tete, et le plaisir que m'avait fait tout a l'heure eprouver leur vue s'en trouva tellement accru que, pris d'une sorte d'ivresse, je ne pus plus penser a autre chose. A ce moment et comme nous etions deja loin de Martinville en tournant la tete je les apercus de nouveau, tout noirs cette fois, car le soleil etait deja couche. Par moments les tournants du chemin me les derobaient, puis ils se montrerent une derniere fois et enfin je ne les vis plus. Sans me dire que ce qui etait cache derriere les clochers de Martinville devait etre quelque chose d'analogue a une jolie phrase, puisque c'etait sous la forme de mots qui me faisaient plaisir, que cela m'etait apparu, demandant un crayon et du papier au docteur, je composai malgre les cahots de la voiture, pour soulager ma conscience et obeir a mon enthousiasme, le petit morceau suivant que j'ai retrouve depuis et auquel je n'ai eu a faire subir que peu de changements: Seuls, s'elevant du niveau de la plaine et comme perdus en rase campagne, montaient vers le ciel les deux clochers de Martinville. Bientot nous en vimes trois: venant se placer en face d'eux par une volte hardie, un clocher retardataire, celui de Vieuxvicq, les avait rejoints. Les minutes passaient, nous allions vite et pourtant les trois clochers etaient toujours au loin devant nous, comme trois oiseaux poses sur la plaine, immobiles et qu'on distingue au soleil. Puis le clocher de Vieuxvicq s'ecarta, prit ses distances, et les clochers de Martinville resterent seuls, eclaires par la lumiere du couchant que meme a cette distance, sur leurs pentes, je voyais jouer et sourire. Nous avions ete si longs a nous rapprocher d'eux, que je pensais au temps qu'il faudrait encore pour les atteindre quand, tout d'un coup, la voiture ayant tourne, elle nous deposa a leurs pieds; et ils s'etaient jetes si rudement au-devant d'elle, qu'on n'eut que le temps d'arreter pour ne pas se heurter au porche. Nous poursuivimes notre route; nous avions deja quitte Martinville depuis un peu de temps et le village apres nous avoir accompagnes quelques secondes avait disparu, que restes seuls a l'horizon a nous regarder fuir, ses clochers et celui de Vieuxvicq agitaient encore en signe d'adieu leurs cimes ensoleillees. Parfois l'un s'effacait pour que les deux autres pussent nous apercevoir un instant encore; mais la route changea de direction, ils virerent dans la lumiere comme trois pivots d'or et disparurent a mes yeux. Mais, un peu plus tard, comme nous etions deja pres de Combray, le soleil etant maintenant couche, je les apercus une derniere fois de tres loin qui n'etaient plus que comme trois fleurs peintes sur le ciel au-dessus de la ligne basse des champs. Ils me faisaient penser aussi aux trois jeunes filles d'une legende, abandonnees dans une solitude ou tombait deja l'obscurite; et tandis que nous nous eloignions au galop, je les vis timidement chercher leur chemin et apres quelques gauches trebuchements de leurs nobles silhouettes, se serrer les uns contre les autres, glisser l'un derriere l'autre, ne plus faire sur le ciel encore rose qu'une seule forme noire, charmante et resignee, et s'effacer dans la nuit. Je ne repensai jamais a cette page, mais a ce moment-la, quand, au coin du siege ou le cocher du docteur placait habituellement dans un panier les volailles qu'il avait achetees au marche de Martinville, j'eus fini de l'ecrire, je me trouvai si heureux, je sentais qu'elle m'avait si parfaitement debarrasse de ces clochers et de ce qu'ils cachaient derriere eux, que, comme si j'avais ete moi-meme une poule et si je venais de pondre un uf, je me mis a chanter a tue-tete. Pendant toute la journee, dans ces promenades, j'avais pu rever au plaisir que ce serait d'etre l'ami de la duchesse de Guermantes, de pecher la truite, de me promener en barque sur la Vivonne, et, avide de bonheur, ne demander en ces moments-la rien d'autre a la vie que de se composer toujours d'une suite d'heureux apres-midi. Mais quand sur le chemin du retour j'avais apercu sur la gauche une ferme, assez distante de deux autres qui etaient au contraire tres rapprochees, et a partir de laquelle pour entrer dans Combray il n'y avait plus qu'a prendre une allee de chenes bordee d'un cote de pres appartenant chacun a un petit clos et plantes a intervalles egaux de pommiers qui y portaient, quand ils etaient eclaires par le soleil couchant, le dessin japonais de leurs ombres, brusquement mon cur se mettait a battre, je savais qu'avant une demi-heure nous serions rentres, et que, comme c'etait de regle les jours ou nous etions alles du cote de Guermantes et ou le diner etait servi plus tard, on m'enverrait me coucher sitot ma soupe prise, de sorte que ma mere, retenue a table comme s'il y avait du monde a diner, ne monterait pas me dire bonsoir dans mon lit. La zone de tristesse ou je venais d'entrer etait aussi distincte de la zone, ou je m'elancais avec joie il y avait un moment encore que dans certains ciels une bande rose est separee comme par une ligne d'une bande verte ou d'une bande noire. On voit un oiseau voler dans le rose, il va en atteindre la fin, il touche presque au noir, puis il y est entre. Les desirs qui tout a l'heure m'entouraient, d'aller a Guermantes, de voyager, d'etre heureux, j'etais maintenant tellement en dehors d'eux que leur accomplissement ne m'eut fait aucun plaisir. Comme j'aurais donne tout cela pour pouvoir pleurer toute la nuit dans les bras de maman! Je frissonnais, je ne detachais pas mes yeux angoisses du visage de ma mere, qui n'apparaitrait pas ce soir dans la chambre ou je me voyais deja par la pensee, j'aurais voulu mourir. Et cet etat durerait jusqu'au lendemain, quand les rayons du matin, appuyant, comme le jardinier, leurs barreaux au mur revetu de capucines qui grimpaient jusqu'a ma fenetre, je sauterais a bas du lit pour descendre vite au jardin, sans plus me rappeler que le soir ramenerait jamais l'heure de quitter ma mere. Et de la sorte c'est du cote de Guermantes que j'ai appris a distinguer ces etats qui se succedent en moi, pendant certaines periodes, et vont jusqu'a se partager chaque journee, l'un revenant chasser l'autre, avec la ponctualite de la fievre; contigus, mais si exterieurs l'un a l'autre, si depourvus de moyens de communication entre eux, que je ne puis plus comprendre, plus meme me representer dans l'un, ce que j'ai desire, ou redoute, ou accompli dans l'autre. Aussi le cote de Meseglise et le cote de Guermantes restent-ils pour moi lies a bien des petits evenements de celle de toutes les diverses vies que nous menons parallelement, qui est la plus pleine de peripeties, la plus riche en episodes, je veux dire la vie intellectuelle. Sans doute elle progresse en nous insensiblement et les verites qui en ont change pour nous le sens et l'aspect, qui nous ont ouvert de nouveaux chemins, nous en preparions depuis longtemps la decouverte; mais c'etait sans le savoir; et elles ne datent pour nous que du jour, de la minute ou elles nous sont devenues visibles.

"jeune pianiste jouait, mais seulement si ca lui chantait, car on ne forcait personne et comme disait M. Verdurin: Tout pour les amis, vivent les camarades! Si le pianiste voulait jouer la chevauchee de la Walkyrie ou le prelude de Tristan, Mme Verdurin protestait, non que cette musique lui deplut, mais au contraire parce qu'elle lui causait trop d'impression. Alors vous tenez a ce que j'aie ma migraine? Vous savez bien que c'est la meme chose chaque fois qu'il joue ca. Je sais ce qui m'attend! Demain quand je voudrai me lever, bonsoir, plus personne! S'il ne jouait pas, on causait, et l'un des amis, le plus souvent leur peintre favori d'alors, lachait, comme disait M. Verdurin, une grosse faribole qui faisait s'esclaffer tout le monde, Mme Verdurin surtout, a qui,--tant elle avait l'habitude de prendre au propre les expressions figurees des emotions qu'elle eprouvait,--le docteur Cottard (un jeune debutant a cette epoque) dut un jour remettre sa machoire qu'elle avait decrochee pour avoir trop ri. L'habit noir etait defendu parce qu'on etait entre copains et pour ne pas ressembler aux ennuyeux dont on se garait comme de la peste et qu'on n'invitait qu'aux grandes soirees, donnees le plus rarement possible et seulement si cela pouvait amuser le peintre ou faire connaitre le musicien. Le reste du temps on se contentait de jouer des charades, de souper en costumes, mais entre soi, en ne melant aucun etranger au petit noyau. Mais au fur et a mesure que les camarades avaient pris plus de place dans la vie de Mme Verdurin, les ennuyeux, les reprouves, ce fut tout ce qui retenait les amis loin d'elle, ce qui les empechait quelquefois d'etre libres, ce fut la mere de l'un, la profession de l'autre, la maison de campagne ou la mauvaise sante d'un troisieme. Si le docteur Cottard croyait devoir partir en sortant de table pour retourner aupres d'un malade en danger: Qui sait, lui disait Mme Verdurin, cela lui fera peut-etre beaucoup plus de bien que vous n'alliez pas le deranger ce soir; il passera une bonne nuit sans vous; demain matin vous irez de bonne heure et vous le trouverez gueri. Des le commencement de decembre elle etait malade a la pensee que les fideles lacheraient pour le jour de Noel et le 1er janvier. La tante du pianiste exigeait qu'il vint diner ce jour-la en famille chez sa mere a elle: --Vous croyez qu'elle en mourrait, votre mere, s'ecria durement Mme Verdurin, si vous ne diniez pas avec elle le jour de l'an, comme en province! Ses inquietudes renaissaient a la semaine sainte: --Vous, Docteur, un savant, un esprit fort, vous venez naturellement le vendredi saint comme un autre jour? dit-elle a Cottard la premiere annee, d'un ton assure comme si elle ne pouvait douter de la reponse. Mais elle tremblait en attendant qu'il l'eut prononcee, car s'il n'etait pas venu, elle risquait de se trouver seule. --Je viendrai le vendredi saint... vous faire mes adieux car nous allons passer les fetes de Paques en Auvergne. --En Auvergne? pour vous faire manger par les puces et la vermine, grand bien vous fasse! Et apres un silence: --Si vous nous l'aviez dit au moins, nous aurions tache d'organiser cela et de faire le voyage ensemble dans des conditions confortables. De meme si un fidele avait un ami, ou une habituee un flirt qui serait capable de faire lacher quelquefois, les Verdurin qui ne s'effrayaient pas qu'une femme eut un amant pourvu qu'elle l'eut chez eux, l'aimat en eux, et ne le leur preferat pas, disaient: Eh bien! amenez-le votre ami. Et on l'engageait a l'essai, pour voir s'il etait capable de ne pas avoir de secrets pour Mme Verdurin, s'il etait susceptible d'etre agrege au petit clan. S'il ne l'etait pas on prenait a part le fidele qui l'avait presente et on lui rendait le service de le brouiller avec son ami ou avec sa maitresse. Dans le cas contraire, le nouveau devenait a son tour un fidele. Aussi quand cette annee-la, la demi-mondaine raconta a M. Verdurin qu'elle avait fait la connaissance d'un homme charmant, M. Swann, et insinua qu'il serait tres heureux d'etre recu chez eux, M. Verdurin transmit-il seance tenante la requete a sa femme. (Il n'avait jamais d'avis qu'apres sa femme, dont son role particulier etait de mettre a execution les desirs, ainsi que les desirs des fideles, avec de grandes ressources d'ingeniosite.) --Voici Mme de Crecy qui a quelque chose a te demander. Elle desirerait te presenter un de ses amis, M. Swann. Qu'en dis-tu? --Mais voyons, est-ce qu'on peut refuser quelque chose a une petite perfection comme ca. Taisez-vous, on ne vous demande pas votre avis, je vous dis que vous etes une perfection. --Puisque vous le voulez, repondit Odette sur un ton de marivaudage, et elle ajouta: vous savez que je ne suis pas fishing for compliments. --Eh bien! amenez-le votre ami, s'il est agreable. Certes le petit noyau n'avait aucun rapport avec la societe ou frequentait Swann, et de purs mondains auraient trouve que ce n'etait pas la peine d'y occuper comme lui une situation exceptionnelle pour se faire presenter chez les Verdurin. Mais Swann aimait tellement les femmes, qu'a partir du jour ou il avait connu a peu pres toutes celles de l'aristocratie et ou elles n'avaient plus rien eu a lui apprendre, il n'avait plus tenu a ces lettres de naturalisation, presque des titres de noblesse, que lui avait octroyees le faubourg Saint-Germain, que comme a une sorte de valeur d'echange, de lettre de credit denuee de prix en elle-meme, mais lui permettant de s'improviser une situation dans tel petit trou de province ou tel milieu obscur de Paris, ou la fille du hobereau ou du greffier lui avait semble jolie. Car le desir ou l'amour lui rendait alors un sentiment de vanite dont il etait maintenant exempt dans l'habitude de la vie (bien que ce fut lui sans doute qui autrefois l'avait dirige vers cette carriere mondaine ou il avait gaspille dans les plaisirs frivoles les dons de son esprit et fait servir son erudition en matiere d'art a conseiller les dames de la societe dans leurs achats de tableaux et pour l'ameublement de leurs hotels), et qui lui faisait desirer de briller, aux yeux d'une inconnue dont il s'etait epris, d'une elegance que le nom de Swann a lui tout seul n'impliquait pas. Il le desirait surtout si l'inconnue etait d'humble condition. De meme que ce n'est pas a un autre homme intelligent qu'un homme intelligent aura peur de paraitre bete, ce n'est pas par un grand seigneur, c'est par un rustre qu'un homme elegant craindra de voir son elegance meconnue. Les trois quarts des frais d'esprit et des mensonges de vanite qui ont ete prodigues depuis que le monde existe par des gens qu'ils ne faisaient que diminuer, l'ont ete pour des inferieurs. Et Swann qui etait simple et negligent avec une duchesse, tremblait d'etre meprise, posait, quand il etait devant une femme de chambre. Il n'etait pas comme tant de gens qui par paresse, ou sentiment resigne de l'obligation que cree la grandeur sociale de rester attache a un certain rivage, s'abstiennent des plaisirs que la realite leur presente en dehors de la position mondaine ou ils vivent cantonnes jusqu'a leur mort, se contentant de finir par appeler plaisirs, faute de mieux, une fois qu'ils sont parvenus a s'y habituer, les divertissements mediocres ou les supportables ennuis qu'elle renferme. Swann, lui, ne cherchait pas a trouver jolies les femmes avec qui il passait son temps, mais a passer son temps avec les femmes qu'il avait d'abord trouvees jolies. Et c'etait souvent des femmes de beaute assez vulgaire, car les qualites physiques qu'il recherchait sans s'en rendre compte etaient en complete opposition avec celles qui lui rendaient admirables les femmes sculptees ou peintes par les maitres qu'il preferait. La profondeur, la melancolie de l'expression, glacaient ses sens que suffisait au contraire a eveiller une chair saine, plantureuse et rose. Si en voyage il rencontrait une famille qu'il eut ete plus elegant de ne pas chercher a connaitre, mais dans laquelle une femme se presentait a ses yeux paree d'un charme qu'il n'avait pas encore connu, rester dans son quant a soi et tromper le desir qu'elle avait fait naitre, substituer un plaisir different au plaisir qu'il eut pu connaitre avec elle, en ecrivant a une ancienne maitresse de venir le rejoindre, lui eut semble une aussi lache abdication devant la vie, un aussi stupide renoncement a un bonheur nouveau, que si au lieu de visiter le pays, il s'etait confine dans sa chambre en regardant des vues de Paris. Il ne s'enfermait pas dans l'edifice de ses relations, mais en avait fait, pour pouvoir le reconstruire a pied d'uvre sur de nouveaux frais partout ou une femme lui avait plu, une de ces tentes demontables comme les explorateurs en emportent avec eux. Pour ce qui n'en etait pas transportable ou echangeable contre un plaisir nouveau, il l'eut donne pour rien, si enviable que cela parut a d'autres. Que de fois son credit aupres d'une duchesse, fait du desir accumule depuis des annees que celle-ci avait eu de lui etre agreable sans en avoir trouve l'occasion, il s'en etait defait d'un seul coup en reclamant d'elle par une indiscrete depeche une recommandation telegraphique qui le mit en relation sur l'heure avec un de ses intendants dont il avait remarque la fille a la campagne, comme ferait un affame qui troquerait un diamant contre un morceau de pain. Meme, apres coup, il s'en amusait, car il y avait en lui, rachetee par de rares delicatesses, une certaine muflerie. Puis, il appartenait a cette categorie d'hommes intelligents qui ont vecu dans l'oisivete et qui cherchent une consolation et peut-etre une excuse dans l'idee que cette oisivete offre a leur intelligence des objets aussi dignes d'interet que pourrait faire l'art ou l'etude, que la Vie contient des situations plus interessantes, plus romanesques que",3.5652586774403985,1.8531257796816971,0.32473560170944155,0.11493282607059849,4.57409793814433,4.0,2.554745778039005,26.305084745762713,21.0,22.802954192561813,1.3170103092783505,1.0,0.6590131093113658,1552,623,0.4014175257731959,8169,59,23.35400622013558,13884045611.647743,7377282.471651298,0.6546554722791088,0.6449839557733452,68.71626681810243,10.209704700331994,11.20814326018867,13.563271011707148,13.266543661541156,9.9704381443299,49.04993010658745,5.983050847457627,True,58.0,0.8931987247608927,4.340595111583422,1882.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005086987486010784,0.005086987486010784,0.005086987486010784,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004273069488249059,0.005290466985451216,0.0,0.1487778958554729,44,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"tous les romans. Il l'assurait du moins et le persuadait aisement aux plus affines de ses amis du monde notamment au baron de Charlus, qu'il s'amusait a egayer par le recit des aventures piquantes qui lui arrivaient, soit qu'ayant rencontre en chemin de fer une femme qu'il avait ensuite ramenee chez lui il eut decouvert qu'elle etait la sur d'un souverain entre les mains de qui se melaient en ce moment tous les fils de la politique europeenne, au courant de laquelle il se trouvait ainsi tenu d'une facon tres agreable, soit que par le jeu complexe des circonstances, il dependit du choix qu'allait faire le conclave, s'il pourrait ou non devenir l'amant d'une cuisiniere. Ce n'etait pas seulement d'ailleurs la brillante phalange de vertueuses douairieres, de generaux, d'academiciens, avec lesquels il etait particulierement lie, que Swann forcait avec tant de cynisme a lui servir d'entremetteurs. Tous ses amis avaient l'habitude de recevoir de temps en temps des lettres de lui ou un mot de recommandation ou d'introduction leur etait demande avec une habilete diplomatique qui, persistant a travers les amours successives et les pretextes differents, accusait, plus que n'eussent fait les maladresses, un caractere permanent et des buts identiques. Je me suis souvent fait raconter bien des annees plus tard, quand je commencai a m'interesser a son caractere a cause des ressemblances qu'en de tout autres parties il offrait avec le mien, que quand il ecrivait a mon grand-pere (qui ne l'etait pas encore, car c'est vers l'epoque de ma naissance que commenca la grande liaison de Swann et elle interrompit longtemps ces pratiques) celui-ci, en reconnaissant sur l'enveloppe l'ecriture de son ami, s'ecriait: Voila Swann qui va demander quelque chose: a la garde! Et soit mefiance, soit par le sentiment inconsciemment diabolique qui nous pousse a n'offrir une chose qu'aux gens qui n'en ont pas envie, mes grands-parents opposaient une fin de non-recevoir absolue aux prieres les plus faciles a satisfaire qu'il leur adressait, comme de le presenter a une jeune fille qui dinait tous les dimanches a la maison, et qu'ils etaient obliges, chaque fois que Swann leur en reparlait, de faire semblant de ne plus voir, alors que pendant toute la semaine on se demandait qui on pourrait bien inviter avec elle, finissant souvent par ne trouver personne, faute de faire signe a celui qui en eut ete si heureux. Quelquefois tel couple ami de mes grands-parents et qui jusque-la s'etait plaint de ne jamais voir Swann, leur annoncait avec satisfaction et peut-etre un peu le desir d'exciter l'envie, qu'il etait devenu tout ce qu'il y a de plus charmant pour eux, qu'il ne les quittait plus. Mon grand-pere ne voulait pas troubler leur plaisir mais regardait ma grand'mere en fredonnant: Quelques mois apres, si mon grand-pere demandait au nouvel ami de Swann: Et Swann, le voyez-vous toujours beaucoup? la figure de l'interlocuteur s'allongeait: Ne prononcez jamais son nom devant moi! --Mais je croyais que vous etiez si lies... Il avait ete ainsi pendant quelques mois le familier de cousins de ma grand'mere, dinant presque chaque jour chez eux. Brusquement il cessa de venir, sans avoir prevenu. On le crut malade, et la cousine de ma grand'mere allait envoyer demander de ses nouvelles quand a l'office elle trouva une lettre de lui qui trainait par megarde dans le livre de comptes de la cuisiniere. Il y annoncait a cette femme qu'il allait quitter Paris, qu'il ne pourrait plus venir. Elle etait sa maitresse, et au moment de rompre, c'etait elle seule qu'il avait juge utile d'avertir. Quand sa maitresse du moment etait au contraire une personne mondaine ou du moins une personne qu'une extraction trop humble ou une situation trop irreguliere n'empechait pas qu'il fit recevoir dans le monde, alors pour elle il y retournait, mais seulement dans l'orbite particulier ou elle se mouvait ou bien ou il l'avait entrainee. Inutile de compter sur Swann ce soir, disait-on, vous savez bien que c'est le jour d'Opera de son Americaine. Il la faisait inviter dans les salons particulierement fermes ou il avait ses habitudes, ses diners hebdomadaires, son poker; chaque soir, apres qu'un leger crepelage ajoute a la brosse de ses cheveux roux avait tempere de quelque douceur la vivacite de ses yeux verts, il choisissait une fleur pour sa boutonniere et partait pour retrouver sa maitresse a diner chez l'une ou l'autre des femmes de sa coterie; et alors, pensant a l'admiration et a l'amitie que les gens a la mode pour qui il faisait la pluie et le beau temps et qu'il allait retrouver la, lui prodigueraient devant la femme qu'il aimait, il retrouvait du charme a cette vie mondaine sur laquelle il s'etait blase, mais dont la matiere, penetree et coloree chaudement d'une flamme insinuee qui s'y jouait, lui semblait precieuse et belle depuis qu'il y avait incorpore un nouvel amour. Mais tandis que chacune de ces liaisons, ou chacun de ces flirts, avait ete la realisation plus ou moins complete d'un reve ne de la vue d'un visage ou d'un corps que Swann avait, spontanement, sans s'y efforcer, trouves charmants, en revanche quand un jour au theatre il fut presente a Odette de Crecy par un de ses amis d'autrefois, qui lui avait parle d'elle comme d'une femme ravissante avec qui il pourrait peut-etre arriver a quelque chose, mais en la lui donnant pour plus difficile qu'elle n'etait en realite afin de paraitre lui-meme avoir fait quelque chose de plus aimable en la lui faisant connaitre, elle etait apparue a Swann non pas certes sans beaute, mais d'un genre de beaute qui lui etait indifferent, qui ne lui inspirait aucun desir, lui causait meme une sorte de repulsion physique, de ces femmes comme tout le monde a les siennes, differentes pour chacun, et qui sont l'oppose du type que nos sens reclament. Pour lui plaire elle avait un profil trop accuse, la peau trop fragile, les pommettes trop saillantes, les traits trop tires. Ses yeux etaient beaux mais si grands qu'ils flechissaient sous leur propre masse, fatiguaient le reste de son visage et lui donnaient toujours l'air d'avoir mauvaise mine ou d'etre de mauvaise humeur. Quelque temps apres cette presentation au theatre, elle lui avait ecrit pour lui demander a voir ses collections qui l'interessaient tant, elle, ignorante qui avait le gout des jolies choses, disant qu'il lui semblait qu'elle le connaitrait mieux, quand elle l'aurait vu dans son home ou elle l'imaginait si confortable avec son the et ses livres, quoiqu'elle ne lui eut pas cache sa surprise qu'il habitat ce quartier qui devait etre si triste et qui etait si peu smart pour lui qui l'etait tant. Et apres qu'il l'eut laissee venir, en le quittant elle lui avait dit son regret d'etre restee si peu dans cette demeure ou elle avait ete heureuse de penetrer, parlant de lui comme s'il avait ete pour elle quelque chose de plus que les autres etres qu'elle connaissait et semblant etablir entre leurs deux personnes une sorte de trait d'union romanesque qui l'avait fait sourire. Mais a l'age deja un peu desabuse dont approchait Swann et ou l'on sait se contenter d'etre amoureux pour le plaisir de l'etre sans trop exiger de reciprocite, ce rapprochement des curs, s'il n'est plus comme dans la premiere jeunesse le but vers lequel tend necessairement l'amour, lui reste uni en revanche par une association d'idees si forte, qu'il peut en devenir la cause, s'il se presente avant lui. Autrefois on revait de posseder le cur de la femme dont on etait amoureux; plus tard sentir qu'on possede le cur d'une femme peut suffire a vous en rendre amoureux. Ainsi, a l'age ou il semblerait, comme on cherche surtout dans l'amour un plaisir subjectif, que la part du gout pour la beaute d'une femme devait y etre la plus grande, l'amour peut naitre--l'amour le plus physique--sans qu'il y ait eu, a sa base, un desir prealable. A cette epoque de la vie, on a deja ete atteint plusieurs fois par l'amour; il n'evolue plus seul suivant ses propres lois inconnues et fatales, devant notre cur etonne et passif. Nous venons a son aide, nous le faussons par la memoire, par la suggestion. En reconnaissant un de ses symptomes, nous nous rappelons, nous faisons renaitre les autres. Comme nous possedons sa chanson, gravee en nous tout entiere, nous n'avons pas besoin qu'une femme nous en dise le debut--rempli par l'admiration qu'inspire la beaute--, pour en trouver la suite. Et si elle commence au milieu,--la ou les curs se rapprochent, ou l'on parle de n'exister plus que l'un pour l'autre--, nous avons assez l'habitude de cette musique pour rejoindre tout de suite notre partenaire au passage ou elle nous attend. Odette de Crecy retourna voir Swann, puis rapprocha ses visites; et sans doute chacune d'elles renouvelait pour lui la deception qu'il eprouvait a se retrouver devant ce visage dont il avait un peu oublie les particularites dans l'intervalle, et qu'il ne s'etait rappele ni si expressif ni, malgre sa jeunesse, si fane; il regrettait, pendant qu'elle causait avec lui, que la grande beaute qu'elle avait ne fut pas du genre de celles qu'il aurait spontanement preferees. Il faut d'ailleurs dire que le visage d'Odette paraissait plus maigre et plus proeminent parce que le front et le haut des joues, cette surface unie et plus plane etait recouverte par la masse de cheveux qu'on portait, alors, prolonges en devants, souleves en crepes, repandus en meches folles le long des oreilles; et quant a son corps qui etait admirablement fait, il etait difficile d'en apercevoir la continuite (a cause des modes de l'epoque et quoiqu'elle fut une des femmes de Paris qui s'habillaient le mieux), tant le corsage, s'avancant en saillie comme sur un ventre imaginaire et finissant brusquement en pointe pendant que par en dessous commencait a s'enfler le ballon des doubles jupes, donnait a la femme l'air d'etre composee de pieces differentes mal emmanchees les unes dans les autres; tant les ruches,",4.106349579970767,1.5746676312878927,0.34585894864606725,0.08792786348224409,4.608723958333333,4.0,2.6242363843381815,41.513513513513516,28.0,37.72705790896016,1.2923177083333333,1.0,0.6238266845805398,1536,609,0.396484375,8295,37,21.195894613239336,1604205753.2205338,860625.4040882692,0.7799364867516689,0.7699985558433192,55.36870565878381,15.849619228603604,12.567638695301444,19.235613738738742,21.033846600506756,10.586276041666661,64.23486768018017,9.432432432432432,True,57.0,0.901824034334764,4.450107296137339,1864.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003616273229532898,0.0030135610246107484,0.0,0.1453862660944206,45,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"chose, M. Verdurin acheta pour trois cents francs une pierre reconstituee en laissant entendre qu'on pouvait difficilement en voir d'aussi belle. Quand Mme Verdurin avait annonce qu'on aurait, dans la soiree, M. Swann: Swann? s'etait ecrie le docteur d'un accent rendu brutal par la surprise, car la moindre nouvelle prenait toujours plus au depourvu que quiconque cet homme qui se croyait perpetuellement prepare a tout. Et voyant qu'on ne lui repondait pas: Swann? Qui ca, Swann! hurla-t-il au comble d'une anxiete qui se detendit soudain quand Mme Verdurin eut dit: Mais l'ami dont Odette nous avait parle. --Ah! bon, bon, ca va bien, repondit le docteur apaise. Quant au peintre il se rejouissait de l'introduction de Swann chez Mme Verdurin, parce qu'il le supposait amoureux d'Odette et qu'il aimait a favoriser les liaisons. Rien ne m'amuse comme de faire des mariages, confia-t-il, dans l'oreille, au docteur Cottard, j'en ai deja reussi beaucoup, meme entre femmes! En disant aux Verdurin que Swann etait tres smart, Odette leur avait fait craindre un ennuyeux. Il leur fit au contraire une excellente impression dont a leur insu sa frequentation dans la societe elegante etait une des causes indirectes. Il avait en effet sur les hommes meme intelligents qui ne sont jamais alles dans le monde, une des superiorites de ceux qui y ont un peu vecu, qui est de ne plus le transfigurer par le desir ou par l'horreur qu'il inspire a l'imagination, de le considerer comme sans aucune importance. Leur amabilite, separee de tout snobisme et de la peur de paraitre trop aimable, devenue independante, a cette aisance, cette grace des mouvements de ceux dont les membres assouplis executent exactement ce qu'ils veulent, sans participation indiscrete et maladroite du reste du corps. La simple gymnastique elementaire de l'homme du monde tendant la main avec bonne grace au jeune homme inconnu qu'on lui presente et s'inclinant avec reserve devant l'ambassadeur a qui on le presente, avait fini par passer sans qu'il en fut conscient dans toute l'attitude sociale de Swann, qui vis-a-vis de gens d'un milieu inferieur au sien comme etaient les Verdurin et leurs amis, fit instinctivement montre d'un empressement, se livra a des avances, dont, selon eux, un ennuyeux se fut abstenu. Il n'eut un moment de froideur qu'avec le docteur Cottard: en le voyant lui cligner de l'il et lui sourire d'un air ambigu avant qu'ils se fussent encore parle (mimique que Cottard appelait laisser venir), Swann crut que le docteur le connaissait sans doute pour s'etre trouve avec lui en quelque lieu de plaisir, bien que lui-meme y allat pourtant fort peu, n'ayant jamais vecu dans le monde de la noce. Trouvant l'allusion de mauvais gout, surtout en presence d'Odette qui pourrait en prendre une mauvaise idee de lui, il affecta un air glacial. Mais quand il apprit qu'une dame qui se trouvait pres de lui etait Mme Cottard, il pensa qu'un mari aussi jeune n'aurait pas cherche a faire allusion devant sa femme a des divertissements de ce genre; et il cessa de donner a l'air entendu du docteur la signification qu'il redoutait. Le peintre invita tout de suite Swann a venir avec Odette a son atelier, Swann le trouva gentil. Peut-etre qu'on vous favorisera plus que moi, dit Mme Verdurin, sur un ton qui feignait d'etre pique, et qu'on vous montrera le portrait de Cottard (elle l'avait commande au peintre). Pensez bien, monsieur Biche, rappela-t-elle au peintre, a qui c'etait une plaisanterie consacree de dire monsieur, a rendre le joli regard, le petit cote fin, amusant, de l'il. Vous savez que ce que je veux surtout avoir, c'est son sourire, ce que je vous ai demande c'est le portrait de son sourire. Et comme cette expression lui sembla remarquable elle la repeta tres haut pour etre sure que plusieurs invites l'eussent entendue, et meme, sous un pretexte vague, en fit d'abord rapprocher quelques-uns. Swann demanda a faire la connaissance de tout le monde, meme d'un vieil ami des Verdurin, Saniette, a qui sa timidite, sa simplicite et son bon cur avaient fait perdre partout la consideration que lui avaient value sa science d'archiviste, sa grosse fortune, et la famille distinguee dont il sortait. Il avait dans la bouche, en parlant, une bouillie qui etait adorable parce qu'on sentait qu'elle trahissait moins un defaut de la langue qu'une qualite de l'ame, comme un reste de l'innocence du premier age qu'il n'avait jamais perdue. Toutes les consonnes qu'il ne pouvait prononcer figuraient comme autant de duretes dont il etait incapable. En demandant a etre presente a M. Saniette, Swann fit a Mme Verdurin l'effet de renverser les roles (au point qu'en reponse, elle dit en insistant sur la difference: Monsieur Swann, voudriez-vous avoir la bonte de me permettre de vous presenter notre ami Saniette), mais excita chez Saniette une sympathie ardente que d'ailleurs les Verdurin ne revelerent jamais a Swann, car Saniette les agacait un peu et ils ne tenaient pas a lui faire des amis. Mais en revanche Swann les toucha infiniment en croyant devoir demander tout de suite a faire la connaissance de la tante du pianiste. En robe noire comme toujours, parce qu'elle croyait qu'en noir on est toujours bien et que c'est ce qu'il y a de plus distingue, elle avait le visage excessivement rouge comme chaque fois qu'elle venait de manger. Elle s'inclina devant Swann avec respect, mais se redressa avec majeste. Comme elle n'avait aucune instruction et avait peur de faire des fautes de francais, elle prononcait expres d'une maniere confuse, pensant que si elle lachait un cuir il serait estompe d'un tel vague qu'on ne pourrait le distinguer avec certitude, de sorte que sa conversation n'etait qu'un graillonnement indistinct duquel emergeaient de temps a autre les rares vocables dont elle se sentait sure. Swann crut pouvoir se moquer legerement d'elle en parlant a M. Verdurin lequel au contraire fut pique. --C'est une si excellente femme, repondit-il. Je vous accorde qu'elle n'est pas etourdissante; mais je vous assure qu'elle est agreable quand on cause seul avec elle. Je n'en doute pas, s'empressa de conceder Swann. Je voulais dire qu'elle ne me semblait pas eminente ajouta-t-il en detachant cet adjectif, et en somme c'est plutot un compliment! Tenez, dit M. Verdurin, je vais vous etonner, elle ecrit d'une maniere charmante. Vous n'avez jamais entendu son neveu? c'est admirable, n'est-ce pas, docteur? Voulez-vous que je lui demande de jouer quelque chose, Monsieur Swann? --Mais ce sera un bonheur..., commencait a repondre Swann, quand le docteur l'interrompit d'un air moqueur. En effet ayant retenu que dans la conversation l'emphase, l'emploi de formes solennelles, etait suranne, des qu'il entendait un mot grave dit serieusement comme venait de l'etre le mot bonheur, il croyait que celui qui l'avait prononce venait de se montrer prudhommesque. Et si, de plus, ce mot se trouvait figurer par hasard dans ce qu'il appelait un vieux cliche, si courant que ce mot fut d'ailleurs, le docteur supposait que la phrase commencee etait ridicule et la terminait ironiquement par le lieu commun qu'il semblait accuser son interlocuteur d'avoir voulu placer, alors que celui-ci n'y avait jamais pense. --Un bonheur pour la France! s'ecria-t-il malicieusement en levant les bras avec emphase. M. Verdurin ne put s'empecher de rire. --Qu'est-ce qu'ils ont a rire toutes ces bonnes gens-la, on a l'air de ne pas engendrer la melancolie dans votre petit coin la-bas, s'ecria Mme Verdurin. Si vous croyez que je m'amuse, moi, a rester toute seule en penitence, ajouta-t-elle sur un ton depite, en faisant l'enfant. Mme Verdurin etait assise sur un haut siege suedois en sapin cire, qu'un violoniste de ce pays lui avait donne et qu'elle conservait quoiqu'il rappelat la forme d'un escabeau et jurat avec les beaux meubles anciens qu'elle avait, mais elle tenait a garder en evidence les cadeaux que les fideles avaient l'habitude de lui faire de temps en temps, afin que les donateurs eussent le plaisir de les reconnaitre quand ils venaient. Aussi tachait-elle de persuader qu'on s'en tint aux fleurs et aux bonbons, qui du moins se detruisent; mais elle n'y reussissait pas et c'etait chez elle une collection de chauffe-pieds, de coussins, de pendules, de paravents, de barometres, de potiches, dans une accumulation de redites et un disparate d'etrennes. De ce poste eleve elle participait avec entrain a la conversation des fideles et s'egayait de leurs fumisteries, mais depuis l'accident qui etait arrive a sa machoire, elle avait renonce a prendre la peine de pouffer effectivement et se livrait a la place a une mimique conventionnelle qui signifiait sans fatigue ni risques pour elle, qu'elle riait aux larmes. Au moindre mot que lachait un habitue contre un ennuyeux ou contre un ancien habitue rejete au camp des ennuyeux,--et pour le plus grand desespoir de M. Verdurin qui avait eu longtemps la pretention d'etre aussi aimable que sa femme, mais qui riant pour de bon s'essoufflait vite et avait ete distance et vaincu par cette ruse d'une incessante et fictive hilarite--, elle poussait un petit cri, fermait entierement ses yeux d'oiseau qu'une taie commencait a voiler, et brusquement, comme si elle n'eut eu que le temps de cacher un spectacle indecent ou de parer a un acces mortel, plongeant sa figure dans ses mains qui la recouvraient et n'en laissaient plus rien voir, elle avait l'air de s'efforcer de reprimer, d'aneantir un rire qui, si elle s'y fut abandonnee, l'eut conduite a l'evanouissement. Telle, etourdie par la gaiete des fideles, ivre de camaraderie, de medisance et d'assentiment, Mme Verdurin, juchee sur son perchoir, pareille a un oiseau dont on eut trempe le colifichet dans du vin chaud, sanglotait d'amabilite. Cependant, M. Verdurin, apres avoir demande a Swann la permission d'allumer sa pipe (ici on ne se gene pas, on est entre camarades), priait le jeune artiste de se mettre au piano. --Allons, voyons, ne l'ennuie pas, il n'est pas ici pour etre tourmente, s'ecria Mme Verdurin, je ne veux pas qu'on le tourmente moi! --Mais pourquoi veux-tu que ca l'ennuie, dit",3.6961182592655764,1.5800292838790448,0.33721997656506153,0.09938009751959642,4.673535093367676,4.0,2.6909356674725835,27.24561403508772,21.0,22.611346865657985,1.3657437218287185,1.0,0.7060850254073511,1553,649,0.4179008370895042,8469,57,26.54427984060809,337313917822.8154,174322438.1513258,0.6726999131164381,0.6628655001521111,63.6387828876764,11.151565391263091,11.75648510118857,14.246603630776878,14.205157307305612,10.593972955569864,52.35829916065114,6.842105263157895,True,62.0,0.8770025839793282,4.376744186046512,1935.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005133774311383157,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003949057162602429,0.0017770757231710928,0.0019745285813012143,0.1648578811369509,47,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"les volants, le gilet suivaient en toute independance, selon la fantaisie de leur dessin ou la consistance de leur etoffe, la ligne qui les conduisait aux nuds, aux bouillons de dentelle, aux effiles de jais perpendiculaires, ou qui les dirigeait le long du busc, mais ne s'attachaient nullement a l'etre vivant, qui selon que l'architecture de ces fanfreluches se rapprochait ou s'ecartait trop de la sienne, s'y trouvait engonce ou perdu. Mais, quand Odette etait partie, Swann souriait en pensant qu'elle lui avait dit combien le temps lui durerait jusqu'a ce qu'il lui permit de revenir; il se rappelait l'air inquiet, timide avec lequel elle l'avait une fois prie que ce ne fut pas dans trop longtemps, et les regards qu'elle avait eus a ce moment-la, fixes sur lui en une imploration craintive, et qui la faisaient touchante sous le bouquet de fleurs de pensees artificielles fixe devant son chapeau rond de paille blanche, a brides de velours noir. Et vous, avait-elle dit, vous ne viendriez pas une fois chez moi prendre le the? Il avait allegue des travaux en train, une etude--en realite abandonnee depuis des annees--sur Ver Meer de Delft. Je comprends que je ne peux rien faire, moi chetive, a cote de grands savants comme vous autres, lui avait-elle repondu. Je serais comme la grenouille devant l'areopage. Et pourtant j'aimerais tant m'instruire, savoir, etre initiee. Comme cela doit etre amusant de bouquiner, de fourrer son nez dans de vieux papiers, avait-elle ajoute avec l'air de contentement de soi-meme que prend une femme elegante pour affirmer que sa joie est de se livrer sans crainte de se salir a une besogne malpropre, comme de faire la cuisine en mettant elle-meme les mains a la pate. Vous allez vous moquer de moi, ce peintre qui vous empeche de me voir (elle voulait parler de Ver Meer), je n'avais jamais entendu parler de lui; vit-il encore? Est-ce qu'on peut voir de ses uvres a Paris, pour que je puisse me representer ce que vous aimez, deviner un peu ce qu'il y a sous ce grand front qui travaille tant, dans cette tete qu'on sent toujours en train de reflechir, me dire: voila, c'est a cela qu'il est en train de penser. Quel reve ce serait d'etre melee a vos travaux! Il s'etait excuse sur sa peur des amities nouvelles, ce qu'il avait appele, par galanterie, sa peur d'etre malheureux. Vous avez peur d'une affection? comme c'est drole, moi qui ne cherche que cela, qui donnerais ma vie pour en trouver une, avait-elle dit d'une voix si naturelle, si convaincue, qu'il en avait ete remue. Vous avez du souffrir par une femme. Et vous croyez que les autres sont comme elle. Elle n'a pas su vous comprendre; vous etes un etre si a part. C'est cela que j'ai aime d'abord en vous, j'ai bien senti que vous n'etiez pas comme tout le monde. --Et puis d'ailleurs vous aussi, lui avait-il dit, je sais bien ce que c'est que les femmes, vous devez avoir des tas d'occupations, etre peu libre. --Moi, je n'ai jamais rien a faire! Je suis toujours libre, je le serai toujours pour vous. A n'importe quelle heure du jour ou de la nuit ou il pourrait vous etre commode de me voir, faites-moi chercher, et je serai trop heureuse d'accourir. Le ferez-vous? Savez-vous ce qui serait gentil, ce serait de vous faire presenter a Mme Verdurin chez qui je vais tous les soirs. Croyez-vous! si on s'y retrouvait et si je pensais que c'est un peu pour moi que vous y etes! Et sans doute, en se rappelant ainsi leurs entretiens, en pensant ainsi a elle quand il etait seul, il faisait seulement jouer son image entre beaucoup d'autres images de femmes dans des reveries romanesques; mais si, grace a une circonstance quelconque (ou meme peut-etre sans que ce fut grace a elle, la circonstance qui se presente au moment ou un etat, latent jusque-la, se declare, pouvant n'avoir influe en rien sur lui) l'image d'Odette de Crecy venait a absorber toutes ces reveries, si celles-ci n'etaient plus separables de son souvenir, alors l'imperfection de son corps ne garderait plus aucune importance, ni qu'il eut ete, plus ou moins qu'un autre corps, selon le gout de Swann, puisque devenu le corps de celle qu'il aimait, il serait desormais le seul qui fut capable de lui causer des joies et des tourments. Mon grand-pere avait precisement connu, ce qu'on n'aurait pu dire d'aucun de leurs amis actuels, la famille de ces Verdurin. Mais il avait perdu toute relation avec celui qu'il appelait le jeune Verdurin et qu'il considerait, un peu en gros, comme tombe--tout en gardant de nombreux millions--dans la boheme et la racaille. Un jour il recut une lettre de Swann lui demandant s'il ne pourrait pas le mettre en rapport avec les Verdurin: A la garde! a la garde! s'etait ecrie mon grand-pere, ca ne m'etonne pas du tout, c'est bien par la que devait finir Swann. Joli milieu! D'abord je ne peux pas faire ce qu'il me demande parce que je ne connais plus ce monsieur. Et puis ca doit cacher une histoire de femme, je ne me mele pas de ces affaires-la. Ah bien! nous allons avoir de l'agrement si Swann s'affuble des petits Verdurin. Et sur la reponse negative de mon grand-pere, c'est Odette qui avait amene elle-meme Swann chez les Verdurin. Les Verdurin avaient eu a diner, le jour ou Swann y fit ses debuts, le docteur et Mme Cottard, le jeune pianiste et sa tante, et le peintre qui avait alors leur faveur, auxquels s'etaient joints dans la soiree quelques autres fideles. Le docteur Cottard ne savait jamais d'une facon certaine de quel ton il devait repondre a quelqu'un, si son interlocuteur voulait rire ou etait serieux. Et a tout hasard il ajoutait a toutes ses expressions de physionomie l'offre d'un sourire conditionnel et provisoire dont la finesse expectante le disculperait du reproche de naivete, si le propos qu'on lui avait tenu se trouvait avoir ete facetieux. Mais comme pour faire face a l'hypothese opposee il n'osait pas laisser ce sourire s'affirmer nettement sur son visage, on y voyait flotter perpetuellement une incertitude ou se lisait la question qu'il n'osait pas poser: Dites-vous cela pour de bon? Il n'etait pas plus assure de la facon dont il devait se comporter dans la rue, et meme en general dans la vie, que dans un salon, et on le voyait opposer aux passants, aux voitures, aux evenements un malicieux sourire qui otait d'avance a son attitude toute impropriete puisqu'il prouvait, si elle n'etait pas de mise, qu'il le savait bien et que s'il avait adopte celle-la, c'etait par plaisanterie. Sur tous les points cependant ou une franche question lui semblait permise, le docteur ne se faisait pas faute de s'efforcer de restreindre le champ de ses doutes et de completer son instruction. C'est ainsi que, sur les conseils qu'une mere prevoyante lui avait donnes quand il avait quitte sa province, il ne laissait jamais passer soit une locution ou un nom propre qui lui etaient inconnus, sans tacher de se faire documenter sur eux. Pour les locutions, il etait insatiable de renseignements, car, leur supposant parfois un sens plus precis qu'elles n'ont, il eut desire savoir ce qu'on voulait dire exactement par celles qu'il entendait le plus souvent employer: la beaute du diable, du sang bleu, une vie de batons de chaise, le quart d'heure de Rabelais, etre le prince des elegances, donner carte blanche, etre reduit a quia, etc., et dans quels cas determines il pouvait a son tour les faire figurer dans ses propos. A leur defaut il placait des jeux de mots qu'il avait appris. Quant aux noms de personnes nouveaux qu'on prononcait devant lui il se contentait seulement de les repeter sur un ton interrogatif qu'il pensait suffisant pour lui valoir des explications qu'il n'aurait pas l'air de demander. Comme le sens critique qu'il croyait exercer sur tout lui faisait completement defaut, le raffinement de politesse qui consiste a affirmer, a quelqu'un qu'on oblige, sans souhaiter d'en etre cru, que c'est a lui qu'on a obligation, etait peine perdue avec lui, il prenait tout au pied de la lettre. Quel que fut l'aveuglement de Mme Verdurin a son egard, elle avait fini, tout en continuant a le trouver tres fin, par etre agacee de voir que quand elle l'invitait dans une avant-scene a entendre Sarah Bernhardt, lui disant, pour plus de grace: Vous etes trop aimable d'etre venu, docteur, d'autant plus que je suis sure que vous avez deja souvent entendu Sarah Bernhardt, et puis nous sommes peut-etre trop pres de la scene, le docteur Cottard qui etait entre dans la loge avec un sourire qui attendait pour se preciser ou pour disparaitre que quelqu'un d'autorise le renseignat sur la valeur du spectacle, lui repondait: En effet on est beaucoup trop pres et on commence a etre fatigue de Sarah Bernhardt. Mais vous m'avez exprime le desir que je vienne. Pour moi vos desirs sont des ordres. Je suis trop heureux de vous rendre ce petit service. Que ne ferait-on pas pour vous etre agreable, vous etes si bonne! Et il ajoutait: Sarah Bernhardt c'est bien la Voix d'Or, n'est-ce pas? On ecrit souvent aussi qu'elle brule les planches. C'est une expression bizarre, n'est-ce pas? dans l'espoir de commentaires qui ne venaient point. Tu sais, avait dit Mme Verdurin a son mari, je crois que nous faisons fausse route quand par modestie nous deprecions ce que nous offrons au docteur. C'est un savant qui vit en dehors de l'existence pratique, il ne connait pas par lui-meme la valeur des choses et il s'en rapporte a ce que nous lui en disons. --Je n'avais pas ose te le dire, mais je l'avais remarque, repondit M. Verdurin. Et au jour de l'an suivant, au lieu d'envoyer au docteur Cottard un rubis de trois mille francs en lui disant que c'etait bien peu de",3.720049490738964,1.7849992116787068,0.3424809429112444,0.1281808016725739,4.3761935073201785,4.0,2.41634968303221,23.102941176470587,17.5,22.708601444932164,1.2737110120942075,1.0,0.5972056001368479,1571,618,0.39338001273074474,7963,68,25.878642512112435,173361095281.17786,89361389.32019477,0.6926500786151459,0.7066761406533646,75.62956308271242,8.44993700153518,9.478462496947788,11.379941588347624,10.73334200771334,8.650795671546785,42.0717508518366,4.382352941176471,True,59.0,0.8747422680412371,4.104639175257732,1940.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009560428140912397,0.003117530915514912,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003325366309882573,0.004156707887353216,0.0037410370986178947,0.10412371134020619,46,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"l'esprit, il avait cesse de croire a leur realite, sans pouvoir non plus la nier tout a fait. Aussi avait-il pris l'habitude de se refugier dans des pensees sans importance qui lui permettaient de laisser de cote le fond des choses. De meme qu'il ne se demandait pas s'il n'eut pas mieux fait de ne pas aller dans le monde, mais en revanche savait avec certitude que s'il avait accepte une invitation il devait s'y rendre et que s'il ne faisait pas de visite apres il lui fallait laisser des cartes, de meme dans sa conversation il s'efforcait de ne jamais exprimer avec cur une opinion intime sur les choses, mais de fournir des details materiels qui valaient en quelque sorte par eux-memes et lui permettaient de ne pas donner sa mesure. Il etait extremement precis pour une recette de cuisine, pour la date de la naissance ou de la mort d'un peintre, pour la nomenclature de ses uvres. Parfois, malgre tout, il se laissait aller a emettre un jugement sur une uvre, sur une maniere de comprendre la vie, mais il donnait alors a ses paroles un ton ironique comme s'il n'adherait pas tout entier a ce qu'il disait. Or, comme certains valetudinaires chez qui tout d'un coup, un pays ou ils sont arrives, un regime different, quelquefois une evolution organique, spontanee et mysterieuse, semblent amener une telle regression de leur mal qu'ils commencent a envisager la possibilite inesperee de commencer sur le tard une vie toute differente, Swann trouvait en lui, dans le souvenir de la phrase qu'il avait entendue, dans certaines sonates qu'il s'etait fait jouer, pour voir s'il ne l'y decouvrirait pas, la presence d'une de ces realites invisibles auxquelles il avait cesse de croire et auxquelles, comme si la musique avait eu sur la secheresse morale dont il souffrait une sorte d'influence elective, il se sentait de nouveau le desir et presque la force de consacrer sa vie. Mais n'etant pas arrive a savoir de qui etait l'uvre qu'il avait entendue, il n'avait pu se la procurer et avait fini par l'oublier. Il avait bien rencontre dans la semaine quelques personnes qui se trouvaient comme lui a cette soiree et les avait interrogees; mais plusieurs etaient arrivees apres la musique ou parties avant; certaines pourtant etaient la pendant qu'on l'executait mais etaient allees causer dans un autre salon, et d'autres restees a ecouter n'avaient pas entendu plus que les premieres. Quant aux maitres de maison ils savaient que c'etait une uvre nouvelle que les artistes qu'ils avaient engages avaient demande a jouer; ceux-ci etant partis en tournee, Swann ne put pas en savoir davantage. Il avait bien des amis musiciens, mais tout en se rappelant le plaisir special et intraduisible que lui avait fait la phrase, en voyant devant ses yeux les formes qu'elle dessinait, il etait pourtant incapable de la leur chanter. Puis il cessa d'y penser. Or, quelques minutes a peine apres que le petit pianiste avait commence de jouer chez Mme Verdurin, tout d'un coup apres une note haute longuement tenue pendant deux mesures, il vit approcher, s'echappant de sous cette sonorite prolongee et tendue comme un rideau sonore pour cacher le mystere de son incubation, il reconnut, secrete, bruissante et divisee, la phrase aerienne et odorante qu'il aimait. Et elle etait si particuliere, elle avait un charme si individuel et qu'aucun autre n'aurait pu remplacer, que ce fut pour Swann comme s'il eut rencontre dans un salon ami une personne qu'il avait admiree dans la rue et desesperait de jamais retrouver. A la fin, elle s'eloigna, indicatrice, diligente, parmi les ramifications de son parfum, laissant sur le visage de Swann le reflet de son sourire. Mais maintenant il pouvait demander le nom de son inconnue (on lui dit que c'etait l'andante de la sonate pour piano et violon de Vinteuil), il la tenait, il pourrait l'avoir chez lui aussi souvent qu'il voudrait, essayer d'apprendre son langage et son secret. Aussi quand le pianiste eut fini, Swann s'approcha-t-il de lui pour lui exprimer une reconnaissance dont la vivacite plut beaucoup a Mme Verdurin. --Quel charmeur, n'est-ce pas, dit-elle a Swann; la comprend-il assez, sa sonate, le petit miserable? Vous ne saviez pas que le piano pouvait atteindre a ca. C'est tout excepte du piano, ma parole! Chaque fois j'y suis reprise, je crois entendre un orchestre. C'est meme plus beau que l'orchestre, plus complet. Le jeune pianiste s'inclina, et, souriant, soulignant les mots comme s'il avait fait un trait d'esprit: --Vous etes tres indulgente pour moi, dit-il. Et tandis que Mme Verdurin disait a son mari: Allons, donne-lui de l'orangeade, il l'a bien meritee, Swann racontait a Odette comment il avait ete amoureux de cette petite phrase. Quand Mme Verdurin, ayant dit d'un peu loin: Eh bien! il me semble qu'on est en train de vous dire de belles choses, Odette, elle repondit: Oui, de tres belles et Swann trouva delicieuse sa simplicite. Cependant il demandait des renseignements sur Vinteuil, sur son uvre, sur l'epoque de sa vie ou il avait compose cette sonate, sur ce qu'avait pu signifier pour lui la petite phrase, c'est cela surtout qu'il aurait voulu savoir. Mais tous ces gens qui faisaient profession d'admirer ce musicien (quand Swann avait dit que sa sonate etait vraiment belle, Mme Verdurin s'etait ecriee: Je vous crois un peu qu'elle est belle! Mais on n'avoue pas qu'on ne connait pas la sonate de Vinteuil, on n'a pas le droit de ne pas la connaitre, et le peintre avait ajoute: Ah! c'est tout a fait une tres grande machine, n'est-ce pas. Ce n'est pas si vous voulez la chose cher et public, n'est-ce pas, mais c'est la tres grosse impression pour les artistes), ces gens semblaient ne s'etre jamais pose ces questions car ils furent incapables d'y repondre. Meme a une ou deux remarques particulieres que fit Swann sur sa phrase preferee: --Tiens, c'est amusant, je n'avais jamais fait attention; je vous dirai que je n'aime pas beaucoup chercher la petite bete et m'egarer dans des pointes d'aiguille; on ne perd pas son temps a couper les cheveux en quatre ici, ce n'est pas le genre de la maison, repondit Mme Verdurin, que le docteur Cottard regardait avec une admiration beate et un zele studieux se jouer au milieu de ce flot d'expressions toutes faites. D'ailleurs lui et Mme Cottard avec une sorte de bon sens comme en ont aussi certaines gens du peuple se gardaient bien de donner une opinion ou de feindre l'admiration pour une musique qu'ils s'avouaient l'un a l'autre, une fois rentres chez eux, ne pas plus comprendre que la peinture de M. Biche. Comme le public ne connait du charme, de la grace, des formes de la nature que ce qu'il en a puise dans les poncifs d'un art lentement assimile, et qu'un artiste original commence par rejeter ces poncifs, M. et Mme Cottard, image en cela du public, ne trouvaient ni dans la sonate de Vinteuil, ni dans les portraits du peintre, ce qui faisait pour eux l'harmonie de la musique et la beaute de la peinture. Il leur semblait quand le pianiste jouait la sonate qu'il accrochait au hasard sur le piano des notes que ne reliaient pas en effet les formes auxquelles ils etaient habitues, et que le peintre jetait au hasard des couleurs sur ses toiles. Quand, dans celles-ci, ils pouvaient reconnaitre une forme, ils la trouvaient alourdie et vulgarisee (c'est-a-dire depourvue de l'elegance de l'ecole de peinture a travers laquelle ils voyaient dans la rue meme, les etres vivants), et sans verite, comme si M. Biche n'eut pas su comment etait construite une epaule et que les femmes n'ont pas les cheveux mauves. Pourtant les fideles s'etant disperses, le docteur sentit qu'il y avait la une occasion propice et pendant que Mme Verdurin disait un dernier mot sur la sonate de Vinteuil, comme un nageur debutant qui se jette a l'eau pour apprendre, mais choisit un moment ou il n'y a pas trop de monde pour le voir: --Alors, c'est ce qu'on appelle un musicien di primo cartello! s'ecria-t-il avec une brusque resolution. Swann apprit seulement que l'apparition recente de la sonate de Vinteuil avait produit une grande impression dans une ecole de tendances tres avancees mais etait entierement inconnue du grand public. --Je connais bien quelqu'un qui s'appelle Vinteuil, dit Swann, en pensant au professeur de piano des surs de ma grand'mere. --C'est peut-etre lui, s'ecria Mme Verdurin. --Oh! non, repondit Swann en riant. Si vous l'aviez vu deux minutes, vous ne vous poseriez pas la question. --Alors poser la question c'est la resoudre? dit le docteur. --Mais ce pourrait etre un parent, reprit Swann, cela serait assez triste, mais enfin un homme de genie peut etre le cousin d'une vieille bete. Si cela etait, j'avoue qu'il n'y a pas de supplice que je ne m'imposerais pour que la vieille bete me presentat a l'auteur de la sonate: d'abord le supplice de frequenter la vieille bete, et qui doit etre affreux. Le peintre savait que Vinteuil etait a ce moment tres malade et que le docteur Potain craignait de ne pouvoir le sauver. --Comment, s'ecria Mme Verdurin, il y a encore des gens qui se font soigner par Potain! --Ah! madame Verdurin, dit Cottard, sur un ton de marivaudage, vous oubliez que vous parlez d'un de mes conferes, je devrais dire un de mes maitres. Le peintre avait entendu dire que Vinteuil etait menace d'alienation mentale. Et il assurait qu'on pouvait s'en apercevoir a certains passages de sa sonate. Swann ne trouva pas cette remarque absurde, mais elle le troubla; car une uvre de musique pure ne contenant aucun des rapports logiques dont l'alteration dans le langage denonce la folie, la folie reconnue dans une sonate lui paraissait quelque chose d'aussi mysterieux que la folie d'une chienne, la folie d'un cheval, qui pourtant s'observent en effet. --Laissez-moi donc tranquille avec vos maitres, vous en savez dix fois autant que lui, repondit Mme",3.9246055721091335,2.0953764214953416,0.33994502809154475,0.11325980285224507,4.56258064516129,4.0,2.5069490103052656,27.678571428571427,23.0,23.03421922058659,1.344516129032258,1.0,0.6701123579822263,1550,591,0.38129032258064516,8170,56,23.933145404416972,24776102196.247135,13012658.716516353,0.7049808112057773,0.6904530639035834,64.99518548387098,11.069933179723503,11.20814326018867,13.961751152073731,13.899040552995388,9.958554838709674,51.485023041474655,6.589285714285714,True,44.0,0.8839285714285714,4.290966386554622,1904.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01607324516785351,0.003051881993896236,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006103763987792472,0.005289928789420142,0.008545269582909461,0.13130252100840337,49,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"Verdurin au docteur Cottard, du ton d'une personne qui a le courage de ses opinions et tient bravement tete a ceux qui ne sont pas du meme avis qu'elle. Vous ne tuez pas vos malades, vous, au moins! --Mais, Madame, il est de l'Academie, repliqua le docteur d'un ton air ironique. Si un malade prefere mourir de la main d'un des princes de la science... C'est beaucoup plus chic de pouvoir dire: C'est Potain qui me soigne. --Ah! c'est plus chic? dit Mme Verdurin. Alors il y a du chic dans les maladies, maintenant? je ne savais pas ca.. Ce que vous m'amusez, s'ecria-t-elle tout a coup en plongeant sa figure dans ses mains. Et moi, bonne bete qui discutais serieusement sans m'apercevoir que vous me faisiez monter a l'arbre. Quant a M. Verdurin, trouvant que c'etait un peu fatigant de se mettre a rire pour si peu, il se contenta de tirer une bouffee de sa pipe en songeant avec tristesse qu'il ne pouvait plus rattraper sa femme sur le terrain de l'amabilite. --Vous savez que votre ami nous plait beaucoup, dit Mme Verdurin a Odette au moment ou celle-ci lui souhaitait le bonsoir. Il est simple, charmant; si vous n'avez jamais a nous presenter que des amis comme cela, vous pouvez les amener. M. Verdurin fit remarquer que pourtant Swann n'avait pas apprecie la tante du pianiste. --Il s'est senti un peu depayse, cet homme, repondit Mme Verdurin, tu ne voudrais pourtant pas que, la premiere fois, il ait deja le ton de la maison comme Cottard qui fait partie de notre petit clan depuis plusieurs annees. La premiere fois ne compte pas, c'etait utile pour prendre langue. Odette, il est convenu qu'il viendra nous retrouver demain au Chatelet. Si vous alliez le prendre? --Mais non, il ne veut pas. --Ah! enfin, comme vous voudrez. Pourvu qu'il n'aille pas lacher au dernier moment! A la grande surprise de Mme Verdurin, il ne lacha jamais. Il allait les rejoindre n'importe ou, quelquefois dans les restaurants de banlieue ou on allait peu encore, car ce n'etait pas la saison, plus souvent au theatre, que Mme Verdurin aimait beaucoup, et comme un jour, chez elle, elle dit devant lui que pour les soirs de premieres, de galas, un coupe-file leur eut ete fort utile, que cela les avait beaucoup genes de ne pas en avoir le jour de l'enterrement de Gambetta, Swann qui ne parlait jamais de ses relations brillantes, mais seulement de celles mal cotees qu'il eut juge peu delicat de cacher, et au nombre desquelles il avait pris dans le faubourg Saint-Germain l'habitude de ranger les relations avec le monde officiel, repondit: --Je vous promets de m'en occuper, vous l'aurez a temps pour la reprise des Danicheff, je dejeune justement demain avec le Prefet de police a l'Elysee. --Comment ca, a l'Elysee? cria le docteur Cottard d'une voix tonnante. --Oui, chez M. Grevy, repondit Swann, un peu gene de l'effet que sa phrase avait produit. Et le peintre dit au docteur en maniere de plaisanterie: --Ca vous prend souvent? Generalement, une fois l'explication donnee, Cottard disait: Ah! bon, bon, ca va bien et ne montrait plus trace d'emotion. Mais cette fois-ci, les derniers mots de Swann, au lieu de lui procurer l'apaisement habituel, porterent au comble son etonnement qu'un homme avec qui il dinait, qui n'avait ni fonctions officielles, ni illustration d'aucune sorte, frayat avec le Chef de l'Etat. --Comment ca, M. Grevy? vous connaissez M. Grevy? dit-il a Swann de l'air stupide et incredule d'un municipal a qui un inconnu demande a voir le President de la Republique et qui, comprenant par ces mots a qui il a affaire, comme disent les journaux, assure au pauvre dement qu'il va etre recu a l'instant et le dirige sur l'infirmerie speciale du depot. --Je le connais un peu, nous avons des amis communs (il n'osa pas dire que c'etait le prince de Galles), du reste il invite tres facilement et je vous assure que ces dejeuners n'ont rien d'amusant, ils sont d'ailleurs tres simples, on n'est jamais plus de huit a table, repondit Swann qui tachait d'effacer ce que semblaient avoir de trop eclatant aux yeux de son interlocuteur, des relations avec le President de la Republique. Aussitot Cottard, s'en rapportant aux paroles de Swann, adopta cette opinion, au sujet de la valeur d'une invitation chez M. Grevy, que c'etait chose fort peu recherchee et qui courait les rues. Des lors il ne s'etonna plus que Swann, aussi bien qu'un autre, frequentat l'Elysee, et meme il le plaignait un peu d'aller a des dejeuners que l'invite avouait lui-meme etre ennuyeux. --Ah! bien, bien, ca va bien, dit-il sur le ton d'un douanier, mefiant tout a l'heure, mais qui, apres vos explications, vous donne son visa et vous laisse passer sans ouvrir vos malles. --Ah! je vous crois qu'ils ne doivent pas etre amusants ces dejeuners, vous avez de la vertu d'y aller, dit Mme Verdurin, a qui le President de la Republique apparaissait comme un ennuyeux particulierement redoutable parce qu'il disposait de moyens de seduction et de contrainte qui, employes a l'egard des fideles, eussent ete capables de les faire lacher. Il parait qu'il est sourd comme un pot et qu'il mange avec ses doigts. --En effet, alors, cela ne doit pas beaucoup vous amuser d'y aller, dit le docteur avec une nuance de commiseration; et, se rappelant le chiffre de huit convives: Sont-ce des dejeuners intimes? demanda-t-il vivement avec un zele de linguiste plus encore qu'une curiosite de badaud. Mais le prestige qu'avait a ses yeux le President de la Republique finit pourtant par triompher et de l'humilite de Swann et de la malveillance de Mme Verdurin, et a chaque diner, Cottard demandait avec interet: Verrons-nous ce soir M. Swann? Il a des relations personnelles avec M. Grevy. C'est bien ce qu'on appelle un gentleman? Il alla meme jusqu'a lui offrir une carte d'invitation pour l'exposition dentaire. --Vous serez admis avec les personnes qui seront avec vous, mais on ne laisse pas entrer les chiens. Vous comprenez je vous dis cela parce que j'ai eu des amis qui ne le savaient pas et qui s'en sont mordu les doigts. Quant a M. Verdurin il remarqua le mauvais effet qu'avait produit sur sa femme cette decouverte que Swann avait des amities puissantes dont il n'avait jamais parle. Si l'on n'avait pas arrange une partie au dehors, c'est chez les Verdurin que Swann retrouvait le petit noyau, mais il ne venait que le soir et n'acceptait presque jamais a diner malgre les instances d'Odette. --Je pourrais meme diner seule avec vous, si vous aimiez mieux cela, lui disait-elle. --Et Mme Verdurin? --Oh! ce serait bien simple. Je n'aurais qu'a dire que ma robe n'a pas ete prete, que mon cab est venu en retard. Il y a toujours moyen de s'arranger. --Vous etes gentille. Mais Swann se disait que s'il montrait a Odette (en consentant seulement a la retrouver apres diner), qu'il y avait des plaisirs qu'il preferait a celui d'etre avec elle, le gout qu'elle ressentait pour lui ne connaitrait pas de longtemps la satiete. Et, d'autre part, preferant infiniment a celle d'Odette, la beaute d'une petite ouvriere fraiche et bouffie comme une rose et dont il etait epris, il aimait mieux passer le commencement de la soiree avec elle, etant sur de voir Odette ensuite. C'est pour les memes raisons qu'il n'acceptait jamais qu'Odette vint le chercher pour aller chez les Verdurin. La petite ouvriere l'attendait pres de chez lui a un coin de rue que son cocher Remi connaissait, elle montait a cote de Swann et restait dans ses bras jusqu'au moment ou la voiture l'arretait devant chez les Verdurin. A son entree, tandis que Mme Verdurin montrant des roses qu'il avait envoyees le matin lui disait: Je vous gronde et lui indiquait une place a cote d'Odette, le pianiste jouait pour eux deux, la petite phrase de Vinteuil qui etait comme l'air national de leur amour. Il commencait par la tenue des tremolos de violon que pendant quelques mesures on entend seuls, occupant tout le premier plan, puis tout d'un coup ils semblaient s'ecarter et comme dans ces tableaux de Pieter de Hooch, qu'approfondit le cadre etroit d'une porte entr'ouverte, tout au loin, d'une couleur autre, dans le veloute d'une lumiere interposee, la petite phrase apparaissait, dansante, pastorale, intercalee, episodique, appartenant a un autre monde. Elle passait a plis simples et immortels, distribuant ca et la les dons de sa grace, avec le meme ineffable sourire; mais Swann y croyait distinguer maintenant du desenchantement. Elle semblait connaitre la vanite de ce bonheur dont elle montrait la voie. Dans sa grace legere, elle avait quelque chose d'accompli, comme le detachement qui succede au regret. Mais peu lui importait, il la considerait moins en elle-meme,--en ce qu'elle pouvait exprimer pour un musicien qui ignorait l'existence et de lui et d'Odette quand il l'avait composee, et pour tous ceux qui l'entendraient dans des siecles--, que comme un gage, un souvenir de son amour qui, meme pour les Verdurin que pour le petit pianiste, faisait penser a Odette en meme temps qu'a lui, les unissait; c'etait au point que, comme Odette, par caprice, l'en avait prie, il avait renonce a son projet de se faire jouer par un artiste la sonate entiere, dont il continua a ne connaitre que ce passage. Qu'avez-vous besoin du reste? lui avait-elle dit. C'est ca notre morceau. Et meme, souffrant de songer, au moment ou elle passait si proche et pourtant a l'infini, que tandis qu'elle s'adressait a eux, elle ne les connaissait pas, il regrettait presque qu'elle eut une signification, une beaute intrinseque et fixe, etrangere a eux, comme en des bijoux donnes, ou meme en des lettres ecrites par une femme aimee, nous en voulons a l'eau de la gemme, et aux mots du langage, de ne pas etre faits uniquement de l'essence d'une liaison passagere et d'un etre particulier. Souvent il se trouvait qu'il",3.247721953439287,1.7478191207140228,0.3567412258854939,0.10768361748773152,4.471881060116354,4.0,2.498289890362286,20.905405405405407,13.5,23.568284299788274,1.345830639948287,1.0,0.6906806960782552,1547,607,0.39237233354880413,8114,74,28.779829982041292,3154433318625.213,1630198097.4807303,0.5717840307991798,0.5464964291443013,71.75874137388843,8.443909659497898,10.758950730005283,11.775219692866754,10.085262495850735,9.078758888170654,42.17237373119726,4.445945945945946,True,65.0,0.869250645994832,4.19328165374677,1935.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.016165336607325557,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006138735420503376,0.002864743196234909,0.007366482504604052,0.13850129198966407,50,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"M. Verdurin, M. Swann ne connait peut-etre pas la sonate en fa diese que nous avons decouverte, il va nous jouer l'arrangement pour piano. --Ah! non, non, pas ma sonate! cria Mme Verdurin, je n'ai pas envie a force de pleurer de me fiche un rhume de cerveau avec nevralgies faciales, comme la derniere fois; merci du cadeau, je ne tiens pas a recommencer; vous etes bons vous autres, on voit bien que ce n'est pas vous qui garderez le lit huit jours! Cette petite scene qui se renouvelait chaque fois que le pianiste allait jouer enchantait les amis aussi bien que si elle avait ete nouvelle, comme une preuve de la seduisante originalite de la Patronne et de sa sensibilite musicale. Ceux qui etaient pres d'elle faisaient signe a ceux qui plus loin fumaient ou jouaient aux cartes, de se rapprocher, qu'il se passait quelque chose, leur disant, comme on fait au Reichstag dans les moments interessants: Ecoutez, ecoutez. Et le lendemain on donnait des regrets a ceux qui n'avaient pas pu venir en leur disant que la scene avait ete encore plus amusante que d'habitude. --Eh bien! voyons, c'est entendu, dit M. Verdurin, il ne jouera que l'andante. --Que l'andante, comme tu y vas s'ecria Mme Verdurin. C'est justement l'andante qui me casse bras et jambes. Il est vraiment superbe le Patron! C'est comme si dans la Neuvieme il disait: nous n'entendrons que le finale, ou dans les Maitres que l'ouverture. Le docteur cependant, poussait Mme Verdurin a laisser jouer le pianiste, non pas qu'il crut feints les troubles que la musique lui donnait--il y reconnaissait certains etats neurastheniques--mais par cette habitude qu'ont beaucoup de medecins, de faire flechir immediatement la severite de leurs prescriptions des qu'est en jeu, chose qui leur semble beaucoup plus importante, quelque reunion mondaine dont ils font partie et dont la personne a qui ils conseillent d'oublier pour une fois sa dyspepsie, ou sa grippe, est un des facteurs essentiels. --Vous ne serez pas malade cette fois-ci, vous verrez, lui dit-il en cherchant a la suggestionner du regard. Et si vous etes malade nous vous soignerons. --Bien vrai? repondit Mme Verdurin, comme si devant l'esperance d'une telle faveur il n'y avait plus qu'a capituler. Peut-etre aussi a force de dire qu'elle serait malade, y avait-il des moments ou elle ne se rappelait plus que c'etait un mensonge et prenait une ame de malade. Or ceux-ci, fatigues d'etre toujours obliges de faire dependre de leur sagesse la rarete de leurs acces, aiment se laisser aller a croire qu'ils pourront faire impunement tout ce qui leur plait et leur fait mal d'habitude, a condition de se remettre en les mains d'un etre puissant, qui, sans qu'ils aient aucune peine a prendre, d'un mot ou d'une pilule, les remettra sur pied. Odette etait allee s'asseoir sur un canape de tapisserie qui etait pres du piano: --Vous savez, j'ai ma petite place, dit-elle a Mme Verdurin. Celle-ci, voyant Swann sur une chaise, le fit lever: --Vous n'etes pas bien la, allez donc vous mettre a cote d'Odette, n'est-ce pas Odette, vous ferez bien une place a M. Swann? --Quel joli Beauvais, dit avant de s'asseoir Swann qui cherchait a etre aimable. --Ah! je suis contente que vous appreciiez mon canape, repondit Mme Verdurin. Et je vous previens que si vous voulez en voir d'aussi beau, vous pouvez y renoncer tout de suite. Jamais ils n'ont rien fait de pareil. Les petites chaises aussi sont des merveilles. Tout a l'heure vous regarderez cela. Chaque bronze correspond comme attribut au petit sujet du siege; vous savez, vous avez de quoi vous amuser si vous voulez regarder cela, je vous promets un bon moment. Rien que les petites frises des bordures, tenez la, la petite vigne sur fond rouge de l'Ours et les Raisins. Est-ce dessine? Qu'est-ce que vous en dites, je crois qu'ils le savaient plutot, dessiner! Est-elle assez appetissante cette vigne? Mon mari pretend que je n'aime pas les fruits parce que j'en mange moins que lui. Mais non, je suis plus gourmande que vous tous, mais je n'ai pas besoin de me les mettre dans la bouche puisque je jouis par les yeux. Qu'est ce que vous avez tous a rire? demandez au docteur, il vous dira que ces raisins-la me purgent. D'autres font des cures de Fontainebleau, moi je fais ma petite cure de Beauvais. Mais, monsieur Swann, vous ne partirez pas sans avoir touche les petits bronzes des dossiers. Est-ce assez doux comme patine? Mais non, a pleines mains, touchez-les bien. --Ah! si madame Verdurin commence a peloter les bronzes, nous n'entendrons pas de musique ce soir, dit le peintre. --Taisez-vous, vous etes un vilain. Au fond, dit-elle en se tournant vers Swann, on nous defend a nous autres femmes des choses moins voluptueuses que cela. Mais il n'y a pas une chair comparable a cela! Quand M. Verdurin me faisait l'honneur d'etre jaloux de moi--allons, sois poli au moins, ne dis pas que tu ne l'as jamais ete...-- --Mais je ne dis absolument rien. Voyons docteur je vous prends a temoin: est-ce que j'ai dit quelque chose? Swann palpait les bronzes par politesse et n'osait pas cesser tout de suite. --Allons, vous les caresserez plus tard; maintenant c'est vous qu'on va caresser, qu'on va caresser dans l'oreille; vous aimez cela, je pense; voila un petit jeune homme qui va s'en charger. Or quand le pianiste eut joue, Swann fut plus aimable encore avec lui qu'avec les autres personnes qui se trouvaient la. Voici pourquoi: L'annee precedente, dans une soiree, il avait entendu une uvre musicale executee au piano et au violon. D'abord, il n'avait goute que la qualite materielle des sons secretes par les instruments. Et c'avait deja ete un grand plaisir quand au-dessous de la petite ligne du violon mince, resistante, dense et directrice, il avait vu tout d'un coup chercher a s'elever en un clapotement liquide, la masse de la partie de piano, multiforme, indivise, plane et entrechoquee comme la mauve agitation des flots que charme et bemolise le clair de lune. Mais a un moment donne, sans pouvoir nettement distinguer un contour, donner un nom a ce qui lui plaisait, charme tout d'un coup, il avait cherche a recueillir la phrase ou l'harmonie--il ne savait lui-meme--qui passait et qui lui avait ouvert plus largement l'ame, comme certaines odeurs de roses circulant dans l'air humide du soir ont la propriete de dilater nos narines. Peut-etre est-ce parce qu'il ne savait pas la musique qu'il avait pu eprouver une impression aussi confuse, une de ces impressions qui sont peut-etre pourtant les seules purement musicales, inattendues, entierement originales, irreductibles a tout autre ordre d'impressions. Une impression de ce genre pendant un instant, est pour ainsi dire sine materia. Sans doute les notes que nous entendons alors, tendent deja, selon leur hauteur et leur quantite, a couvrir devant nos yeux des surfaces de dimensions variees, a tracer des arabesques, a nous donner des sensations de largeur, de tenuite, de stabilite, de caprice. Mais les notes sont evanouies avant que ces sensations soient assez formees en nous pour ne pas etre submergees par celles qu'eveillent deja les notes suivantes ou meme simultanees. Et cette impression continuerait a envelopper de sa liquidite et de son fondu les motifs qui par instants en emergent, a peine discernables, pour plonger aussitot et disparaitre, connus seulement par le plaisir particulier qu'ils donnent, impossibles a decrire, a se rappeler, a nommer, ineffables,--si la memoire, comme un ouvrier qui travaille a etablir des fondations durables au milieu des flots, en fabriquant pour nous des fac-similes de ces phrases fugitives, ne nous permettait de les comparer a celles qui leur succedent et de les differencier. Ainsi a peine la sensation delicieuse que Swann avait ressentie etait-elle expiree, que sa memoire lui en avait fourni seance tenante une transcription sommaire et provisoire, mais sur laquelle il avait jete les yeux tandis que le morceau continuait, si bien que quand la meme impression etait tout d'un coup revenue, elle n'etait deja plus insaisissable. Il s'en representait l'etendue, les groupements symetriques, la graphie, la valeur expressive; il avait devant lui cette chose qui n'est plus de la musique pure, qui est du dessin, de l'architecture, de la pensee, et qui permet de se rappeler la musique. Cette fois il avait distingue nettement une phrase s'elevant pendant quelques instants au-dessus des ondes sonores. Elle lui avait propose aussitot des voluptes particulieres, dont il n'avait jamais eu l'idee avant de l'entendre, dont il sentait que rien autre qu'elle ne pourrait les lui faire connaitre, et il avait eprouve pour elle comme un amour inconnu. D'un rythme lent elle le dirigeait ici d'abord, puis la, puis ailleurs, vers un bonheur noble, inintelligible et precis. Et tout d'un coup au point ou elle etait arrivee et d'ou il se preparait a la suivre, apres une pause d'un instant, brusquement elle changeait de direction et d'un mouvement nouveau, plus rapide, menu, melancolique, incessant et doux, elle l'entrainait avec elle vers des perspectives inconnues. Puis elle disparut. Il souhaita passionnement la revoir une troisieme fois. Et elle reparut en effet mais sans lui parler plus clairement, en lui causant meme une volupte moins profonde. Mais rentre chez lui il eut besoin d'elle, il etait comme un homme dans la vie de qui une passante qu'il a apercue un moment vient de faire entrer l'image d'une beaute nouvelle qui donne a sa propre sensibilite une valeur plus grande, sans qu'il sache seulement s'il pourra revoir jamais celle qu'il aime deja et dont il ignore jusqu'au nom. Meme cet amour pour une phrase musicale sembla un instant devoir amorcer chez Swann la possibilite d'une sorte de rajeunissement. Depuis si longtemps il avait renonce a appliquer sa vie a un but ideal et la bornait a la poursuite de satisfactions quotidiennes, qu'il croyait, sans jamais se le dire formellement, que cela ne changerait plus jusqu'a sa mort; bien plus, ne se sentant plus d'idees elevees dans",3.289944797728541,1.4760968589081005,0.3601867232226624,0.08482502690042984,4.641913152926369,4.0,2.591709756378194,21.767123287671232,16.0,18.770072760928592,1.3492762743864066,1.0,0.7002434476043787,1589,650,0.4090623033354311,8354,73,28.815906756785964,3270312809911.6147,1670231261.446177,0.6751632534174455,0.6715572128780711,70.59259704992373,8.82063811995138,10.840075552587543,12.054866936213868,11.316972594118816,10.134600377595973,43.98235299188772,4.835616438356165,True,62.0,0.8667007150153218,4.266598569969356,1958.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003195526263231476,0.005592170960655083,0.0,0.13125638406537282,48,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"s'etait tant attarde avec la jeune ouvriere avant d'aller chez les Verdurin, qu'une fois la petite phrase jouee par le pianiste, Swann s'apercevait qu'il etait bientot l'heure qu'Odette rentrat. Il la reconduisait jusqu'a la porte de son petit hotel, rue La Perouse, derriere l'Arc de Triomphe. Et c'etait peut-etre a cause de cela, pour ne pas lui demander toutes les faveurs, qu'il sacrifiait le plaisir moins necessaire pour lui de la voir plus tot, d'arriver chez les Verdurin avec elle, a l'exercice de ce droit qu'elle lui reconnaissait de partir ensemble et auquel il attachait plus de prix, parce que, grace a cela, il avait l'impression que personne ne la voyait, ne se mettait entre eux, ne l'empechait d'etre encore avec lui, apres qu'il l'avait quittee. Ainsi revenait-elle dans la voiture de Swann; un soir comme elle venait d'en descendre et qu'il lui disait a demain, elle cueillit precipitamment dans le petit jardin qui precedait la maison un dernier chrysantheme et le lui donna avant qu'il fut reparti. Il le tint serre contre sa bouche pendant le retour, et quand au bout de quelques jours la fleur fut fanee, il l'enferma precieusement dans son secretaire. Mais il n'entrait jamais chez elle. Deux fois seulement, dans l'apres-midi, il etait alle participer a cette operation capitale pour elle prendre le the. L'isolement et le vide de ces courtes rues (faites presque toutes de petits hotels contigus, dont tout a coup venait rompre la monotonie quelque sinistre echoppe, temoignage historique et reste sordide du temps ou ces quartiers etaient encore mal fames), la neige qui etait restee dans le jardin et aux arbres, le neglige de la saison, le voisinage de la nature, donnaient quelque chose de plus mysterieux a la chaleur, aux fleurs qu'il avait trouvees en entrant. Laissant a gauche, au rez-de-chaussee sureleve, la chambre a coucher d'Odette qui donnait derriere sur une petite rue parallele, un escalier droit entre des murs peints de couleur sombre et d'ou tombaient des etoffes orientales, des fils de chapelets turcs et une grande lanterne japonaise suspendue a une cordelette de soie (mais qui, pour ne pas priver les visiteurs des derniers conforts de la civilisation occidentale s'eclairait au gaz), montait au salon et au petit salon. Ils etaient precedes d'un etroit vestibule dont le mur quadrille d'un treillage de jardin, mais dore, etait borde dans toute sa longueur d'une caisse rectangulaire ou fleurissaient comme dans une serre une rangee de ces gros chrysanthemes encore rares a cette epoque, mais bien eloignes cependant de ceux que les horticulteurs reussirent plus tard a obtenir. Swann etait agace par la mode qui depuis l'annee derniere se portait sur eux, mais il avait eu plaisir, cette fois, a voir la penombre de la piece zebree de rose, d'oranger et de blanc par les rayons odorants de ces astres ephemeres qui s'allument dans les jours gris. Odette l'avait recu en robe de chambre de soie rose, le cou et les bras nus. Elle l'avait fait asseoir pres d'elle dans un des nombreux retraits mysterieux qui etaient menages dans les enfoncements du salon, proteges par d'immenses palmiers contenus dans des cache-pot de Chine, ou par des paravents auxquels etaient fixes des photographies, des nuds de rubans et des eventails. Elle lui avait dit: Vous n'etes pas confortable comme cela, attendez, moi je vais bien vous arranger, et avec le petit rire vaniteux qu'elle aurait eu pour quelque invention particuliere a elle, avait installe derriere la tete de Swann, sous ses pieds, des coussins de soie japonaise qu'elle petrissait comme si elle avait ete prodigue de ces richesses et insoucieuse de leur valeur. Mais quand le valet de chambre etait venu apporter successivement les nombreuses lampes qui, presque toutes enfermees dans des potiches chinoises, brulaient isolees ou par couples, toutes sur des meubles differents comme sur des autels et qui dans le crepuscule deja presque nocturne de cette fin d'apres-midi d'hiver avaient fait reparaitre un coucher de soleil plus durable, plus rose et plus humain,--faisant peut-etre rever dans la rue quelque amoureux arrete devant le mystere de la presence que decelaient et cachaient a la fois les vitres rallumees--, elle avait surveille severement du coin de l'il le domestique pour voir s'il les posait bien a leur place consacree. Elle pensait qu'en en mettant une seule la ou il ne fallait pas, l'effet d'ensemble de son salon eut ete detruit, et son portrait, place sur un chevalet oblique drape de peluche, mal eclaire. Aussi suivait-elle avec fievre les mouvements de cet homme grossier et le reprimanda-t-elle vivement parce qu'il avait passe trop pres de deux jardinieres qu'elle se reservait de nettoyer elle-meme dans sa peur qu'on ne les abimat et qu'elle alla regarder de pres pour voir s'il ne les avait pas ecornees. Elle trouvait a tous ses bibelots chinois des formes amusantes, et aussi aux orchidees, aux catleyas surtout, qui etaient, avec les chrysanthemes, ses fleurs preferees, parce qu'ils avaient le grand merite de ne pas ressembler a des fleurs, mais d'etre en soie, en satin. Celle-la a l'air d'etre decoupee dans la doublure de mon manteau, dit-elle a Swann en lui montrant une orchidee, avec une nuance d'estime pour cette fleur si chic, pour cette sur elegante et imprevue que la nature lui donnait, si loin d'elle dans l'echelle des etres et pourtant raffinee, plus digne que bien des femmes qu'elle lui fit une place dans son salon. En lui montrant tour a tour des chimeres a langues de feu decorant une potiche ou brodees sur un ecran, les corolles d'un bouquet d'orchidees, un dromadaire d'argent nielle aux yeux incrustes de rubis qui voisinait sur la cheminee avec un crapaud de jade, elle affectait tour a tour d'avoir peur de la mechancete, ou de rire de la cocasserie des monstres, de rougir de l'indecence des fleurs et d'eprouver un irresistible desir d'aller embrasser le dromadaire et le crapaud qu'elle appelait: cheris. Et ces affectations contrastaient avec la sincerite de certaines de ses devotions, notamment a Notre-Dame du Laghet qui l'avait jadis, quand elle habitait Nice, guerie d'une maladie mortelle et dont elle portait toujours sur elle une medaille d'or a laquelle elle attribuait un pouvoir sans limites. Odette fit a Swann son the, lui demanda: Citron ou creme? et comme il repondit creme, lui dit en riant: Un nuage! Et comme il le trouvait bon: Vous voyez que je sais ce que vous aimez. Ce the en effet avait paru a Swann quelque chose de precieux comme a elle-meme et l'amour a tellement besoin de se trouver une justification, une garantie de duree, dans des plaisirs qui au contraire sans lui n'en seraient pas et finissent avec lui, que quand il l'avait quittee a sept heures pour rentrer chez lui s'habiller, pendant tout le trajet qu'il fit dans son coupe, ne pouvant contenir la joie que cet apres-midi lui avait causee, il se repetait: Ce serait bien agreable d'avoir ainsi une petite personne chez qui on pourrait trouver cette chose si rare, du bon the. Une heure apres, il recut un mot d'Odette, et reconnut tout de suite cette grande ecriture dans laquelle une affectation de raideur britannique imposait une apparence de discipline a des caracteres informes qui eussent signifie peut-etre pour des yeux moins prevenus le desordre de la pensee, l'insuffisance de l'education, le manque de franchise et de volonte. Swann avait oublie son etui a cigarettes chez Odette. Que n'y avez-vous oublie aussi votre cur, je ne vous aurais pas laisse le reprendre. Une seconde visite qu'il lui fit eut plus d'importance peut-etre. En se rendant chez elle ce jour-la comme chaque fois qu'il devait la voir d'avance, il se la representait; et la necessite ou il etait pour trouver jolie sa figure de limiter aux seules pommettes roses et fraiches, les joues qu'elle avait si souvent jaunes, languissantes, parfois piquees de petits points rouges, l'affligeait comme une preuve que l'ideal est inaccessible et le bonheur mediocre. Il lui apportait une gravure qu'elle desirait voir. Elle etait un peu souffrante; elle le recut en peignoir de crepe de Chine mauve, ramenant sur sa poitrine, comme un manteau, une etoffe richement brodee. Debout a cote de lui, laissant couler le long de ses joues ses cheveux qu'elle avait denoues, flechissant une jambe dans une attitude legerement dansante pour pouvoir se pencher sans fatigue vers la gravure qu'elle regardait, en inclinant la tete, de ses grands yeux, si fatigues et maussades quand elle ne s'animait pas, elle frappa Swann par sa ressemblance avec cette figure de Zephora, la fille de Jethro, qu'on voit dans une fresque de la chapelle Sixtine. Swann avait toujours eu ce gout particulier d'aimer a retrouver dans la peinture des maitres non pas seulement les caracteres generaux de la realite qui nous entoure, mais ce qui semble au contraire le moins susceptible de generalite, les traits individuels des visages que nous connaissons: ainsi, dans la matiere d'un buste du doge Loredan par Antoine Rizzo, la saillie des pommettes, l'obliquite des sourcils, enfin la ressemblance criante de son cocher Remi; sous les couleurs d'un Ghirlandajo, le nez de M. de Palancy; dans un portrait de Tintoret, l'envahissement du gras de la joue par l'implantation des premiers poils des favoris, la cassure du nez, la penetration du regard, la congestion des paupieres du docteur du Boulbon. Peut-etre ayant toujours garde un remords d'avoir borne sa vie aux relations mondaines, a la conversation, croyait-il trouver une sorte d'indulgent pardon a lui accorde par les grands artistes, dans ce fait qu'ils avaient eux aussi considere avec plaisir, fait entrer dans leur uvre, de tels visages qui donnent a celle-ci un singulier certificat de realite et de vie, une saveur moderne; peut-etre aussi s'etait-il tellement laisse gagner par la frivolite des gens du monde qu'il eprouvait le besoin de trouver dans une uvre ancienne ces allusions anticipees et rajeunissantes a des noms propres d'aujourd'hui. Peut-etre au contraire avait-il garde suffisamment une nature d'artiste pour que ces caracteristiques individuelles lui causassent du",3.8238401673631217,1.594512763262761,0.34927712774784786,0.06552057211364422,4.728995578016424,4.0,2.6461976562585092,33.680851063829785,26.0,26.858261839942745,1.3202779532533164,1.0,0.67282748706744,1583,683,0.4314592545799116,8489,47,23.144436871275225,11259036316.051119,5932052.853556965,0.7616482642681702,0.7735281341605716,60.953421324982216,13.124811763282754,11.828899740908689,16.226604481122564,17.683994704372246,11.127656348704988,59.012499831991505,8.53191489361702,True,46.0,0.8914646996838778,4.472602739726027,1898.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005911912503694945,0.004433934377771209,0.0,0.15858798735511065,51,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"plaisir en prenant une signification plus generale, des qu'il les apercevait deracinees, delivrees, dans la ressemblance d'un portrait plus ancien avec un original qu'il ne representait pas. Quoi qu'il en soit et peut-etre parce que la plenitude d'impressions qu'il avait depuis quelque temps et bien qu'elle lui fut venue plutot avec l'amour de la musique, avait enrichi meme son gout pour la peinture, le plaisir fut plus profond et devait exercer sur Swann une influence durable, qu'il trouva a ce moment-la dans la ressemblance d'Odette avec la Zephora de ce Sandro di Mariano auquel on ne donne plus volontiers son surnom populaire de Botticelli depuis que celui-ci evoque au lieu de l'uvre veritable du peintre l'idee banale et fausse qui s'en est vulgarisee. Il n'estima plus le visage d'Odette selon la plus ou moins bonne qualite de ses joues et d'apres la douceur purement carnee qu'il supposait devoir leur trouver en les touchant avec ses levres si jamais il osait l'embrasser, mais comme un echeveau de lignes subtiles et belles que ses regards deviderent, poursuivant la courbe de leur enroulement, rejoignant la cadence de la nuque a l'effusion des cheveux et a la flexion des paupieres, comme en un portrait d'elle en lequel son type devenait intelligible et clair. Il la regardait; un fragment de la fresque apparaissait dans son visage et dans son corps, que des lors il chercha toujours a y retrouver soit qu'il fut aupres d'Odette, soit qu'il pensat seulement a elle, et bien qu'il ne tint sans doute au chef-d'uvre florentin que parce qu'il le retrouvait en elle, pourtant cette ressemblance lui conferait a elle aussi une beaute, la rendait plus precieuse. Swann se reprocha d'avoir meconnu le prix d'un etre qui eut paru adorable au grand Sandro, et il se felicita que le plaisir qu'il avait a voir Odette trouvat une justification dans sa propre culture esthetique. Il se dit qu'en associant la pensee d'Odette a ses reves de bonheur il ne s'etait pas resigne a un pis-aller aussi imparfait qu'il l'avait cru jusqu'ici, puisqu'elle contentait en lui ses gouts d'art les plus raffines. Il oubliait qu'Odette n'etait pas plus pour cela une femme selon son desir, puisque precisement son desir avait toujours ete oriente dans un sens oppose a ses gouts esthetiques. Le mot d'uvre florentine rendit un grand service a Swann. Il lui permit, comme un titre, de faire penetrer l'image d'Odette dans un monde de reves, ou elle n'avait pas eu acces jusqu'ici et ou elle s'impregna de noblesse. Et tandis que la vue purement charnelle qu'il avait eue de cette femme, en renouvelant perpetuellement ses doutes sur la qualite de son visage, de son corps, de toute sa beaute, affaiblissait son amour, ces doutes furent detruits, cet amour assure quand il eut a la place pour base les donnees d'une esthetique certaine; sans compter que le baiser et la possession qui semblaient naturels et mediocres s'ils lui etaient accordes par une chair abimee, venant couronner l'adoration d'une piece de musee, lui parurent devoir etre surnaturels et delicieux. Et quand il etait tente de regretter que depuis des mois il ne fit plus que voir Odette, il se disait qu'il etait raisonnable de donner beaucoup de son temps a un chef-d'uvre inestimable, coule pour une fois dans une matiere differente et particulierement savoureuse, en un exemplaire rarissime qu'il contemplait tantot avec l'humilite, la spiritualite et le desinteressement d'un artiste, tantot avec l'orgueil, l'egoisme et la sensualite d'un collectionneur. Il placa sur sa table de travail, comme une photographie d'Odette, une reproduction de la fille de Jethro. Il admirait les grands yeux, le delicat visage qui laissait deviner la peau imparfaite, les boucles merveilleuses des cheveux le long des joues fatiguees, et adaptant ce qu'il trouvait beau jusque-la d'une facon esthetique a l'idee d'une femme vivante, il le transformait en merites physiques qu'il se felicitait de trouver reunis dans un etre qu'il pourrait posseder. Cette vague sympathie qui nous porte vers un chef-d'uvre que nous regardons, maintenant qu'il connaissait l'original charnel de la fille de Jethro, elle devenait un desir qui supplea desormais a celui que le corps d'Odette ne lui avait pas d'abord inspire. Quand il avait regarde longtemps ce Botticelli, il pensait a son Botticelli a lui qu'il trouvait plus beau encore et approchant de lui la photographie de Zephora, il croyait serrer Odette contre son cur. Et cependant ce n'etait pas seulement la lassitude d'Odette qu'il s'ingeniait a prevenir, c'etait quelquefois aussi la sienne propre; sentant que depuis qu'Odette avait toutes facilites pour le voir, elle semblait n'avoir pas grand'chose a lui dire, il craignait que les facons un peu insignifiantes, monotones, et comme definitivement fixees, qui etaient maintenant les siennes quand ils etaient ensemble, ne finissent par tuer en lui cet espoir romanesque d'un jour ou elle voudrait declarer sa passion, qui seul l'avait rendu et garde amoureux. Et pour renouveler un peu l'aspect moral, trop fige, d'Odette, et dont il avait peur de se fatiguer, il lui ecrivait tout d'un coup une lettre pleine de deceptions feintes et de coleres simulees qu'il lui faisait porter avant le diner. Il savait qu'elle allait etre effrayee, lui repondre et il esperait que dans la contraction que la peur de le perdre ferait subir a son ame, jailliraient des mots qu'elle ne lui avait encore jamais dits; et en effet c'est de cette facon qu'il avait obtenu les lettres les plus tendres qu'elle lui eut encore ecrites dont l'une, qu'elle lui avait fait porter a midi de la Maison Doree (c'etait le jour de la fete de Paris-Murcie donnee pour les inondes de Murcie), commencait par ces mots: Mon ami, ma main tremble si fort que je peux a peine ecrire, et qu'il avait gardee dans le meme tiroir que la fleur sechee du chrysantheme. Ou bien si elle n'avait pas eu le temps de lui ecrire, quand il arriverait chez les Verdurin, elle irait vivement a lui et lui dirait: J'ai a vous parler, et il contemplerait avec curiosite sur son visage et dans ses paroles ce qu'elle lui avait cache jusque-la de son cur. Rien qu'en approchant de chez les Verdurin quand il apercevait, eclairees par des lampes, les grandes fenetres dont on ne fermait jamais les volets, il s'attendrissait en pensant a l'etre charmant qu'il allait voir epanoui dans leur lumiere d'or. Parfois les ombres des invites se detachaient minces et noires, en ecran, devant les lampes, comme ces petites gravures qu'on intercale de place en place dans un abat-jour translucide dont les autres feuillets ne sont que clarte. Il cherchait a distinguer la silhouette d'Odette. Puis, des qu'il etait arrive, sans qu'il s'en rendit compte, ses yeux brillaient d'une telle joie que M. Verdurin disait au peintre: Je crois que ca chauffe. Et la presence d'Odette ajoutait en effet pour Swann a cette maison ce dont n'etait pourvue aucune de celles ou il etait recu: une sorte d'appareil sensitif, de reseau nerveux qui se ramifiait dans toutes les pieces et apportait des excitations constantes a son cur. Ainsi le simple fonctionnement de cet organisme social qu'etait le petit clan prenait automatiquement pour Swann des rendez-vous quotidiens avec Odette et lui permettait de feindre une indifference a la voir, ou meme un desir de ne plus la voir, qui ne lui faisait pas courir de grands risques, puisque, quoi qu'il lui eut ecrit dans la journee, il la verrait forcement le soir et la ramenerait chez elle. Mais une fois qu'ayant songe avec maussaderie a cet inevitable retour ensemble, il avait emmene jusqu'au bois sa jeune ouvriere pour retarder le moment d'aller chez les Verdurin, il arriva chez eux si tard qu'Odette, croyant qu'il ne viendrait plus, etait partie. En voyant qu'elle n'etait plus dans le salon, Swann ressentit une souffrance au cur; il tremblait d'etre prive d'un plaisir qu'il mesurait pour la premiere fois, ayant eu jusque-la cette certitude de le trouver quand il le voulait, qui pour tous les plaisirs nous diminue ou meme nous empeche d'apercevoir aucunement leur grandeur. --As-tu vu la tete qu'il a fait quand il s'est apercu qu'elle n'etait pas la? dit M. Verdurin a sa femme, je crois qu'on peut dire qu'il est pince! --La tete qu'il a fait? demanda avec violence le docteur Cottard qui, etant alle un instant voir un malade, revenait chercher sa femme et ne savait pas de qui on parlait. --Comment vous n'avez pas rencontre devant la porte le plus beau des Swann? --Non. M. Swann est venu? --Oh! un instant seulement. Nous avons eu un Swann tres agite, tres nerveux. Vous comprenez, Odette etait partie. --Vous voulez dire qu'elle est du dernier bien avec lui, qu'elle lui a fait voir l'heure du berger, dit le docteur, experimentant avec prudence le sens de ces expressions. --Mais non, il n'y a absolument rien, et entre nous, je trouve qu'elle a bien tort et qu'elle se conduit comme une fameuse cruche, qu'elle est du reste. --Ta, ta, ta, dit M. Verdurin, qu'est-ce que tu en sais qu'il n'y a rien, nous n'avons pas ete y voir, n'est-ce pas. --A moi, elle me l'aurait dit, repliqua fierement Mme Verdurin. Je vous dis qu'elle me raconte toutes ses petites affaires! Comme elle n'a plus personne en ce moment, je lui ai dit qu'elle devrait coucher avec lui. Elle pretend qu'elle ne peut pas, qu'elle a bien eu un fort beguin pour lui mais qu'il est timide avec elle, que cela l'intimide a son tour, et puis qu'elle ne l'aime pas de cette maniere-la, que c'est un etre ideal, qu'elle a peur de deflorer le sentiment qu'elle a pour lui, est-ce que je sais, moi. Ce serait pourtant absolument ce qu'il lui faut. --Tu me permettras de ne pas etre de ton avis, dit M. Verdurin, il ne me revient qu'a demi ce monsieur; je le trouve poseur. Mme Verdurin s'immobilisa, prit une expression inerte comme si elle etait devenue une statue, fiction qui lui permit d'etre censee ne pas avoir entendu",3.7951627278038895,1.596236454012985,0.3289866741247175,0.08782278678492168,4.602101116217991,4.0,2.661817920108049,28.203703703703702,24.0,23.997978024107404,1.3486539724228497,1.0,0.7091303713337272,1523,628,0.412344057780696,8260,54,23.314887367034718,13351403762.77954,7098034.961605284,0.7026138636019995,0.7150807647177806,64.11211467376769,11.323561319034074,11.99289558779546,14.695795335716543,14.347748109238587,10.21084701247538,50.39674375623161,6.2592592592592595,True,54.0,0.8952684742158427,4.391281233386496,1881.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007862903225806451,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004838709677419355,0.0033266129032258063,0.0,0.1669324827219564,52,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"ce mot insupportable de poseur qui avait l'air d'impliquer qu'on pouvait poser avec eux, donc qu'on etait plus qu'eux. --Enfin, s'il n'y a rien, je ne pense pas que ce soit que ce monsieur la croit VERTUEUSE, dit ironiquement M. Verdurin. Et apres tout, on ne peut rien dire, puisqu'il a l'air de la croire intelligente. Je ne sais si tu as entendu ce qu'il lui debitait l'autre soir sur la sonate de Vinteuil; j'aime Odette de tout mon cur, mais pour lui faire des theories d'esthetique, il faut tout de meme etre un fameux jobard! --Voyons, ne dites pas du mal d'Odette, dit Mme Verdurin en faisant l'enfant. Elle est charmante. --Mais cela ne l'empeche pas d'etre charmante; nous ne disons pas du mal d'elle, nous disons que ce n'est pas une vertu ni une intelligence. Au fond, dit-il au peintre, tenez-vous tant que ca a ce qu'elle soit vertueuse? Elle serait peut-etre beaucoup moins charmante, qui sait? Sur le palier, Swann avait ete rejoint par le maitre d'hotel qui ne se trouvait pas la au moment ou il etait arrive et avait ete charge par Odette de lui dire,--mais il y avait bien une heure deja,--au cas ou il viendrait encore, qu'elle irait probablement prendre du chocolat chez Prevost avant de rentrer. Swann partit chez Prevost, mais a chaque pas sa voiture etait arretee par d'autres ou par des gens qui traversaient, odieux obstacles qu'il eut ete heureux de renverser si le proces-verbal de l'agent ne l'eut retarde plus encore que le passage du pieton. Il comptait le temps qu'il mettait, ajoutait quelques secondes a toutes les minutes pour etre sur de ne pas les avoir faites trop courtes, ce qui lui eut laisse croire plus grande qu'elle n'etait en realite sa chance d'arriver assez tot et de trouver encore Odette. Et a un moment, comme un fievreux qui vient de dormir et qui prend conscience de l'absurdite des revasseries qu'il ruminait sans se distinguer nettement d'elles, Swann tout d'un coup apercut en lui l'etrangete des pensees qu'il roulait depuis le moment ou on lui avait dit chez les Verdurin qu'Odette etait deja partie, la nouveaute de la douleur au cur dont il souffrait, mais qu'il constata seulement comme s'il venait de s'eveiller. Quoi? toute cette agitation parce qu'il ne verrait Odette que demain, ce que precisement il avait souhaite, il y a une heure, en se rendant chez Mme Verdurin. Il fut bien oblige de constater que dans cette meme voiture qui l'emmenait chez Prevost, il n'etait plus le meme, et qu'il n'etait plus seul, qu'un etre nouveau etait la avec lui, adherent, amalgame a lui, duquel il ne pourrait peut-etre pas se debarrasser, avec qui il allait etre oblige d'user de menagements comme avec un maitre ou avec une maladie. Et pourtant depuis un moment qu'il sentait qu'une nouvelle personne s'etait ainsi ajoutee a lui, sa vie lui paraissait plus interessante. C'est a peine s'il se disait que cette rencontre possible chez Prevost (de laquelle l'attente saccageait, denudait a ce point les moments qui la precedaient qu'il ne trouvait plus une seule idee, un seul souvenir derriere lequel il put faire reposer son esprit), il etait probable pourtant, si elle avait lieu, qu'elle serait comme les autres, fort peu de chose. Comme chaque soir, des qu'il serait avec Odette, jetant furtivement sur son changeant visage un regard aussitot detourne de peur qu'elle n'y vit l'avance d'un desir et ne crut plus a son desinteressement, il cesserait de pouvoir penser a elle, trop occupe a trouver des pretextes qui lui permissent de ne pas la quitter tout de suite et de s'assurer, sans avoir l'air d'y tenir, qu'il la retrouverait le lendemain chez les Verdurin: c'est-a-dire de prolonger pour l'instant et de renouveler un jour de plus la deception et la torture que lui apportait la vaine presence de cette femme qu'il approchait sans oser l'etreindre. Elle n'etait pas chez Prevost; il voulut chercher dans tous les restaurants des boulevards. Pour gagner du temps, pendant qu'il visitait les uns, il envoya dans les autres son cocher Remi (le doge Loredan de Rizzo) qu'il alla attendre ensuite--n'ayant rien trouve lui-meme--a l'endroit qu'il lui avait designe. La voiture ne revenait pas et Swann se representait le moment qui approchait, a la fois comme celui ou Remi lui dirait: Cette dame est la, et comme celui ou Remi lui dirait, cette dame n'etait dans aucun des cafes. Et ainsi il voyait la fin de la soiree devant lui, une et pourtant alternative, precedee soit par la rencontre d'Odette qui abolirait son angoisse, soit, par le renoncement force a la trouver ce soir, par l'acceptation de rentrer chez lui sans l'avoir vue. Le cocher revint, mais, au moment ou il s'arreta devant Swann, celui-ci ne lui dit pas: Avez-vous trouve cette dame? mais: Faites-moi donc penser demain a commander du bois, je crois que la provision doit commencer a s'epuiser. Peut-etre se disait-il que si Remi avait trouve Odette dans un cafe ou elle l'attendait, la fin de la soiree nefaste etait deja aneantie par la realisation commencee de la fin de soiree bienheureuse et qu'il n'avait pas besoin de se presser d'atteindre un bonheur capture et en lieu sur, qui ne s'echapperait plus. Mais aussi c'etait par force d'inertie; il avait dans l'ame le manque de souplesse que certains etres ont dans le corps, ceux-la qui au moment d'eviter un choc, d'eloigner une flamme de leur habit, d'accomplir un mouvement urgent, prennent leur temps, commencent par rester une seconde dans la situation ou ils etaient auparavant comme pour y trouver leur point d'appui, leur elan. Et sans doute si le cocher l'avait interrompu en lui disant: Cette dame est la, il eut repondu: Ah! oui, c'est vrai, la course que je vous avais donnee, tiens je n'aurais pas cru, et aurait continue a lui parler provision de bois pour lui cacher l'emotion qu'il avait eue et se laisser a lui-meme le temps de rompre avec l'inquietude et de se donner au bonheur. Mais le cocher revint lui dire qu'il ne l'avait trouvee nulle part, et ajouta son avis, en vieux serviteur: --Je crois que Monsieur n'a plus qu'a rentrer. Mais l'indifference que Swann jouait facilement quand Remi ne pouvait plus rien changer a la reponse qu'il apportait tomba, quand il le vit essayer de le faire renoncer a son espoir et a sa recherche: --Mais pas du tout, s'ecria-t-il, il faut que nous trouvions cette dame; c'est de la plus haute importance. Elle serait extremement ennuyee, pour une affaire, et froissee, si elle ne m'avait pas vu. --Je ne vois pas comment cette dame pourrait etre froissee, repondit Remi, puisque c'est elle qui est partie sans attendre Monsieur, qu'elle a dit qu'elle allait chez Prevost et qu'elle n'y etait pas, D'ailleurs on commencait a eteindre partout. Sous les arbres des boulevards, dans une obscurite mysterieuse, les passants plus rares erraient, a peine reconnaissables. Parfois l'ombre d'une femme qui s'approchait de lui, lui murmurant un mot a l'oreille, lui demandant de la ramener, fit tressaillir Swann. Il frolait anxieusement tous ces corps obscurs comme si parmi les fantomes des morts, dans le royaume sombre, il eut cherche Eurydice. De tous les modes de production de l'amour, de tous les agents de dissemination du mal sacre, il est bien l'un des plus efficaces, ce grand souffle d'agitation qui parfois passe sur nous. Alors l'etre avec qui nous nous plaisons a ce moment-la, le sort en est jete, c'est lui que nous aimerons. Il n'est meme pas besoin qu'il nous plut jusque-la plus ou meme autant que d'autres. Ce qu'il fallait, c'est que notre gout pour lui devint exclusif. Et cette condition-la est realisee quand--a ce moment ou il nous fait defaut--a la recherche des plaisirs que son agrement nous donnait, s'est brusquement substitue en nous un besoin anxieux, qui a pour objet cet etre meme, un besoin absurde, que les lois de ce monde rendent impossible a satisfaire et difficile a guerir--le besoin insense et douloureux de le posseder. Swann se fit conduire dans les derniers restaurants; c'est la seule hypothese du bonheur qu'il avait envisagee avec calme; il ne cachait plus maintenant son agitation, le prix qu'il attachait a cette rencontre et il promit en cas de succes une recompense a son cocher, comme si en lui inspirant le desir de reussir qui viendrait s'ajouter a celui qu'il en avait lui-meme, il pouvait faire qu'Odette, au cas ou elle fut deja rentree se coucher, se trouvat pourtant dans un restaurant du boulevard. Il poussa jusqu'a la Maison Doree, entra deux fois chez Tortoni et, sans l'avoir vue davantage, venait de ressortir du Cafe Anglais, marchant a grands pas, l'air hagard, pour rejoindre sa voiture qui l'attendait au coin du boulevard des Italiens, quand il heurta une personne qui venait en sens contraire: c'etait Odette; elle lui expliqua plus tard que n'ayant pas trouve de place chez Prevost, elle etait allee souper a la Maison Doree dans un enfoncement ou il ne l'avait pas decouverte, et elle regagnait sa voiture. Elle s'attendait si peu a le voir qu'elle eut un mouvement d'effroi. Quant a lui, il avait couru Paris non parce qu'il croyait possible de la rejoindre, mais parce qu'il lui etait trop cruel d'y renoncer. Mais cette joie que sa raison n'avait cesse d'estimer, pour ce soir, irrealisable, ne lui en paraissait maintenant que plus reelle; car, il n'y avait pas collabore par la prevision des vraisemblances, elle lui restait exterieure; il n'avait pas besoin de tirer de son esprit pour la lui fournir,--c'est d'elle-meme qu'emanait, c'est elle-meme qui projetait vers lui--cette verite qui rayonnait au point de dissiper comme un songe l'isolement qu'il avait redoute, et sur laquelle il appuyait, il reposait, sans penser, sa reverie heureuse. Ainsi un voyageur arrive par un beau temps au bord de la Mediterranee, incertain de l'existence des pays qu'il vient de quitter, laisse eblouir sa vue, plutot qu'il ne leur jette des regards, par",3.843302236172991,1.7315012780163908,0.348113389121528,0.10228568173801397,4.475506205094709,4.0,2.4967426830315835,27.836363636363636,20.0,21.43977920202083,1.3128674069235793,1.0,0.6389984979593111,1531,569,0.37165251469627697,8194,55,25.026928995407616,73970262805.62671,38466075.30193797,0.7533718630627306,0.7483560482286057,67.51250828335613,10.758017219880056,10.870585023148747,13.773343625675436,13.567816044177896,9.452619203135207,48.280517783979576,5.6909090909090905,True,50.0,0.8793551742069683,4.261050442017681,1923.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014004465191800285,0.010148163182463974,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005682971382179825,0.0036533387456870307,0.0,0.12740509620384816,53,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"la lune brillante qui repandait sa clarte entre ses yeux et les rues desertes, il pensait a cette autre figure claire et legerement rosee comme celle de la lune, qui, un jour, avait surgi dans sa pensee et, depuis projetait sur le monde la lumiere mysterieuse dans laquelle il le voyait. S'il arrivait apres l'heure ou Odette envoyait ses domestiques se coucher, avant de sonner a la porte du petit jardin, il allait d'abord dans la rue, ou donnait au rez-de-chaussee, entre les fenetres toutes pareilles, mais obscures, des hotels contigus, la fenetre, seule eclairee, de sa chambre. Il frappait au carreau, et elle, avertie, repondait et allait l'attendre de l'autre cote, a la porte d'entree. Il trouvait ouverts sur son piano quelques-uns des morceaux qu'elle preferait: la VALSE DES ROSES ou PAUVRE FOU de Tagliafico (qu'on devait, selon sa volonte ecrite, faire executer a son enterrement), il lui demandait de jouer a la place la petite phrase de la sonate de Vinteuil, bien qu'Odette jouat fort mal, mais la vision la plus belle qui nous reste d'une uvre est souvent celle qui s'eleva au-dessus des sons faux tires par des doigts malhabiles, d'un piano desaccorde. La petite phrase continuait a s'associer pour Swann a l'amour qu'il avait pour Odette. Il sentait bien que cet amour, c'etait quelque chose qui ne correspondait a rien d'exterieur, de constatable par d'autres que lui; il se rendait compte que les qualites d'Odette ne justifiaient pas qu'il attachat tant de prix aux moments passes aupres d'elle. Et souvent, quand c'etait l'intelligence positive qui regnait seule en Swann, il voulait cesser de sacrifier tant d'interets intellectuels et sociaux a ce plaisir imaginaire. Mais la petite phrase, des qu'il l'entendait, savait rendre libre en lui l'espace qui pour elle etait necessaire, les proportions de l'ame de Swann s'en trouvaient changees; une marge y etait reservee a une jouissance qui elle non plus ne correspondait a aucun objet exterieur et qui pourtant au lieu d'etre purement individuelle comme celle de l'amour, s'imposait a Swann comme une realite superieure aux choses concretes. Cette soif d'un charme inconnu, la petite phrase l'eveillait en lui, mais ne lui apportait rien de precis pour l'assouvir. De sorte que ces parties de l'ame de Swann ou la petite phrase avait efface le souci des interets materiels, les considerations humaines et valables pour tous, elle les avait laissees vacantes et en blanc, et il etait libre d'y inscrire le nom d'Odette. Puis a ce que l'affection d'Odette pouvait avoir d'un peu court et decevant, la petite phrase venait ajouter, amalgamer son essence mysterieuse. A voir le visage de Swann pendant qu'il ecoutait la phrase, on aurait dit qu'il etait en train d'absorber un anesthesique qui donnait plus d'amplitude a sa respiration. Et le plaisir que lui donnait la musique et qui allait bientot creer chez lui un veritable besoin, ressemblait en effet, a ces moments-la, au plaisir qu'il aurait eu a experimenter des parfums, a entrer en contact avec un monde pour lequel nous ne sommes pas faits, qui nous semble sans forme parce que nos yeux ne le percoivent pas, sans signification parce qu'il echappe a notre intelligence, que nous n'atteignons que par un seul sens. Grand repos, mysterieuse renovation pour Swann,--pour lui dont les yeux quoique delicats amateurs de peinture, dont l'esprit quoique fin observateur de murs, portaient a jamais la trace indelebile de la secheresse de sa vie--de se sentir transforme en une creature etrangere a l'humanite, aveugle, depourvue de facultes logiques, presque une fantastique licorne, une creature chimerique ne percevant le monde que par l'ouie. Et comme dans la petite phrase il cherchait cependant un sens ou son intelligence ne pouvait descendre, quelle etrange ivresse il avait a depouiller son ame la plus interieure de tous les secours du raisonnement et a la faire passer seule dans le couloir, dans le filtre obscur du son. Il commencait a se rendre compte de tout ce qu'il y avait de douloureux, peut-etre meme de secretement inapaise au fond de la douceur de cette phrase, mais il ne pouvait pas en souffrir. Qu'importait qu'elle lui dit que l'amour est fragile, le sien etait si fort! Il jouait avec la tristesse qu'elle repandait, il la sentait passer sur lui, mais comme une caresse qui rendait plus profond et plus doux le sentiment qu'il avait de son bonheur. Il la faisait rejouer dix fois, vingt fois a Odette, exigeant qu'en meme temps elle ne cessat pas de l'embrasser. Chaque baiser appelle un autre baiser. Ah! dans ces premiers temps ou l'on aime, les baisers naissent si naturellement! Ils foisonnent si presses les uns contre les autres; et l'on aurait autant de peine a compter les baisers qu'on s'est donnes pendant une heure que les fleurs d'un champ au mois de mai. Alors elle faisait mine de s'arreter, disant: Comment veux-tu que je joue comme cela si tu me tiens, je ne peux tout faire a la fois, sache au moins ce que tu veux, est-ce que je dois jouer la phrase ou faire des petites caresses, lui se fachait et elle eclatait d'un rire qui se changeait et retombait sur lui, en une pluie de baisers. Ou bien elle le regardait d'un air maussade, il revoyait un visage digne de figurer dans la Vie de Moise de Botticelli, il l'y situait, il donnait au cou d'Odette l'inclinaison necessaire; et quand il l'avait bien peinte a la detrempe, au XVe siecle, sur la muraille de la Sixtine, l'idee qu'elle etait cependant restee la, pres du piano, dans le moment actuel, prete a etre embrassee et possedee, l'idee de sa materialite et de sa vie venait l'enivrer avec une telle force que, l'il egare, les machoires tendues comme pour devorer, il se precipitait sur cette vierge de Botticelli et se mettait a lui pincer les joues. Puis, une fois qu'il l'avait quittee, non sans etre rentre pour l'embrasser encore parce qu'il avait oublie d'emporter dans son souvenir quelque particularite de son odeur ou de ses traits, tandis qu'il revenait dans sa victoria, benissant Odette de lui permettre ces visites quotidiennes, dont il sentait qu'elles ne devaient pas lui causer a elle une bien grande joie, mais qui en le preservant de devenir jaloux,--en lui otant l'occasion de souffrir de nouveau du mal qui s'etait declare en lui le soir ou il ne l'avait pas trouvee chez les Verdurin--l'aideraient a arriver, sans avoir plus d'autres de ces crises dont la premiere avait ete si douloureuse et resterait la seule, au bout de ces heures singulieres de sa vie, heures presque enchantees, a la facon de celles ou il traversait Paris au clair de lune. Et, remarquant, pendant ce retour, que l'astre etait maintenant deplace par rapport a lui, et presque au bout de l'horizon, sentant que son amour obeissait, lui aussi, a des lois immuables et naturelles, il se demandait si cette periode ou il etait entre durerait encore longtemps, si bientot sa pensee ne verrait plus le cher visage qu'occupant une position lointaine et diminuee, et pres de cesser de repandre du charme. Car Swann en trouvait aux choses, depuis qu'il etait amoureux, comme au temps ou, adolescent, il se croyait artiste; mais ce n'etait plus le meme charme, celui-ci c'est Odette seule qui le leur conferait. Il sentait renaitre en lui les inspirations de sa jeunesse qu'une vie frivole avait dissipees, mais elles portaient toutes le reflet, la marque d'un etre particulier; et, dans les longues heures qu'il prenait maintenant un plaisir delicat a passer chez lui, seul avec son ame en convalescence, il redevenait peu a peu lui-meme, mais a une autre. Il n'allait chez elle que le soir, et il ne savait rien de l'emploi de son temps pendant le jour, pas plus que de son passe, au point qu'il lui manquait meme ce petit renseignement initial qui, en nous permettant de nous imaginer ce que nous ne savons pas, nous donne envie de le connaitre. Aussi ne se demandait-il pas ce qu'elle pouvait faire, ni quelle avait ete sa vie. Il souriait seulement quelquefois en pensant qu'il y a quelques annees, quand il ne la connaissait pas, on lui avait parle d'une femme, qui, s'il se rappelait bien, devait certainement etre elle, comme d'une fille, d'une femme entretenue, une de ces femmes auxquelles il attribuait encore, comme il avait peu vecu dans leur societe, le caractere entier, foncierement pervers, dont les dota longtemps l'imagination de certains romanciers. Il se disait qu'il n'y a souvent qu'a prendre le contre-pied des reputations que fait le monde pour juger exactement une personne, quand, a un tel caractere, il opposait celui d'Odette, bonne, naive, eprise d'ideal, presque si incapable de ne pas dire la verite, que, l'ayant un jour priee, pour pouvoir diner seul avec elle, d'ecrire aux Verdurin qu'elle etait souffrante, le lendemain, il l'avait vue, devant Mme Verdurin qui lui demandait si elle allait mieux, rougir, balbutier et refleter malgre elle, sur son visage, le chagrin, le supplice que cela lui etait de mentir, et, tandis qu'elle multipliait dans sa reponse les details inventes sur sa pretendue indisposition de la veille, avoir l'air de faire demander pardon par ses regards suppliants et sa voix desolee de la faussete de ses paroles. Certains jours pourtant, mais rares, elle venait chez lui dans l'apres-midi, interrompre sa reverie ou cette etude sur Ver Meer a laquelle il s'etait remis dernierement. On venait lui dire que Mme de Crecy etait dans son petit salon. Il allait l'y retrouver, et quand il ouvrait la porte, au visage rose d'Odette, des qu'elle avait apercu Swann, venait--, changeant la forme de sa bouche, le regard de ses yeux, le modele de ses joues--se melanger un sourire. Une fois seul, il revoyait ce sourire, celui qu'elle avait eu la veille, un autre dont elle l'avait accueilli telle ou telle fois, celui qui avait ete sa reponse, en voiture, quand il lui avait demande s'il lui etait desagreable en redressant les catleyas; et la",4.306203493572909,1.5998861733660845,0.3243625336167974,0.0853300472578611,4.584457289659602,4.0,2.6254208906736194,37.07142857142857,32.0,24.56031725514696,1.3140655105973025,1.0,0.6596071140014407,1557,614,0.3943481053307643,8247,42,27.477530368350006,857708700044.496,447655897.7267724,0.7698580259230079,0.7655257689068093,58.03755780346823,14.373830167905314,11.899873341045819,17.3719240297275,18.698508120011006,10.358150289017335,59.807459399944946,8.428571428571429,True,53.0,0.8783924843423799,4.304279749478079,1916.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006056323811446452,0.009690118098314323,0.0,0.14822546972860126,55,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"les rayons qu'emet vers lui l'azur lumineux et resistant des eaux. Il monta avec elle dans la voiture qu'elle avait et dit a la sienne de suivre. Elle tenait a la main un bouquet de catleyas et Swann vit, sous sa fanchon de dentelle, qu'elle avait dans les cheveux des fleurs de cette meme orchidee attachees a une aigrette en plumes de cygnes. Elle etait habillee sous sa mantille, d'un flot de velours noir qui, par un rattrape oblique, decouvrait en un large triangle le bas d'une jupe de faille blanche et laissait voir un empiecement, egalement de faille blanche, a l'ouverture du corsage decollete, ou etaient enfoncees d'autres fleurs de catleyas. Elle etait a peine remise de la frayeur que Swann lui avait causee quand un obstacle fit faire un ecart au cheval. Ils furent vivement deplaces, elle avait jete un cri et restait toute palpitante, sans respiration. --Ce n'est rien, lui dit-il, n'ayez pas peur. Et il la tenait par l'epaule, l'appuyant contre lui pour la maintenir; puis il lui dit: --Surtout, ne me parlez pas, ne me repondez que par signes pour ne pas vous essouffler encore davantage. Cela ne vous gene pas que je remette droites les fleurs de votre corsage qui ont ete deplacees par le choc. J'ai peur que vous ne les perdiez, je voudrais les enfoncer un peu. Elle, qui n'avait pas ete habituee a voir les hommes faire tant de facons avec elle, dit en souriant: --Non, pas du tout, ca ne me gene pas. Mais lui, intimide par sa reponse, peut-etre aussi pour avoir l'air d'avoir ete sincere quand il avait pris ce pretexte, ou meme, commencant deja a croire qu'il l'avait ete, s'ecria: --Oh! non, surtout, ne parlez pas, vous allez encore vous essouffler, vous pouvez bien me repondre par gestes, je vous comprendrai bien. Sincerement je ne vous gene pas? Voyez, il y a un peu... je pense que c'est du pollen qui s'est repandu sur vous, vous permettez que je l'essuie avec ma main? Je ne vais pas trop fort, je ne suis pas trop brutal? Je vous chatouille peut-etre un peu? mais c'est que je ne voudrais pas toucher le velours de la robe pour ne pas le friper. Mais, voyez-vous, il etait vraiment necessaire de les fixer ils seraient tombes; et comme cela, en les enfoncant un peu moi-meme... Serieusement, je ne vous suis pas desagreable? Et en les respirant pour voir s'ils n'ont vraiment pas d'odeur non plus? Je n'en ai jamais senti, je peux? dites la verite. Souriant, elle haussa legerement les epaules, comme pour dire vous etes fou, vous voyez bien que ca me plait. Il elevait son autre main le long de la joue d'Odette; elle le regarda fixement, de l'air languissant et grave qu'ont les femmes du maitre florentin avec lesquelles il lui avait trouve de la ressemblance; amenes au bord des paupieres, ses yeux brillants, larges et minces, comme les leurs, semblaient prets a se detacher ainsi que deux larmes. Elle flechissait le cou comme on leur voit faire a toutes, dans les scenes paiennes comme dans les tableaux religieux. Et, en une attitude qui sans doute lui etait habituelle, qu'elle savait convenable a ces moments-la et qu'elle faisait attention a ne pas oublier de prendre, elle semblait avoir besoin de toute sa force pour retenir son visage, comme si une force invisible l'eut attire vers Swann. Et ce fut Swann, qui, avant qu'elle le laissat tomber, comme malgre elle, sur ses levres, le retint un instant, a quelque distance, entre ses deux mains. Il avait voulu laisser a sa pensee le temps d'accourir, de reconnaitre le reve qu'elle avait si longtemps caresse et d'assister a sa realisation, comme une parente qu'on appelle pour prendre sa part du succes d'un enfant qu'elle a beaucoup aime. Peut-etre aussi Swann attachait-il sur ce visage d'Odette non encore possedee, ni meme encore embrassee par lui, qu'il voyait pour la derniere fois, ce regard avec lequel, un jour de depart, on voudrait emporter un paysage qu'on va quitter pour toujours. Mais il etait si timide avec elle, qu'ayant fini par la posseder ce soir-la, en commencant par arranger ses catleyas, soit crainte de la froisser, soit peur de paraitre retrospectivement avoir menti, soit manque d'audace pour formuler une exigence plus grande que celle-la (qu'il pouvait renouveler puisqu'elle n'avait pas fiche Odette la premiere fois), les jours suivants il usa du meme pretexte. Si elle avait des catleyas a son corsage, il disait: C'est malheureux, ce soir, les catleyas n'ont pas besoin d'etre arranges, ils n'ont pas ete deplaces comme l'autre soir; il me semble pourtant que celui-ci n'est pas tres droit. Je peux voir s'ils ne sentent pas plus que les autres? Ou bien, si elle n'en avait pas: Oh! pas de catleyas ce soir, pas moyen de me livrer a mes petits arrangements. De sorte que, pendant quelque temps, ne fut pas change l'ordre qu'il avait suivi le premier soir, en debutant par des attouchements de doigts et de levres sur la gorge d'Odette et que ce fut par eux encore que commencaient chaque fois ses caresses; et, bien plus tard quand l'arrangement (ou le simulacre d'arrangement) des catleyas, fut depuis longtemps tombe en desuetude, la metaphore faire catleya, devenue un simple vocable qu'ils employaient sans y penser quand ils voulaient signifier l'acte de la possession physique--ou d'ailleurs l'on ne possede rien,--survecut dans leur langage, ou elle le commemorait, a cet usage oublie. Et peut-etre cette maniere particuliere de dire faire l'amour ne signifiait-elle pas exactement la meme chose que ses synonymes. On a beau etre blase sur les femmes, considerer la possession des plus differentes comme toujours la meme et connue d'avance, elle devient au contraire un plaisir nouveau s'il s'agit de femmes assez difficiles--ou crues telles par nous--pour que nous soyons obliges de la faire naitre de quelque episode imprevu de nos relations avec elles, comme avait ete la premiere fois pour Swann l'arrangement des catleyas. Il esperait en tremblant, ce soir-la (mais Odette, se disait-il, si elle etait dupe de sa ruse, ne pouvait le deviner), que c'etait la possession de cette femme qui allait sortir d'entre leurs larges petales mauves; et le plaisir qu'il eprouvait deja et qu'Odette ne tolerait peut-etre, pensait-il, que parce qu'elle ne l'avait pas reconnu, lui semblait, a cause de cela--comme il put paraitre au premier homme qui le gouta parmi les fleurs du paradis terrestre--un plaisir qui n'avait pas existe jusque-la, qu'il cherchait a creer, un plaisir--ainsi que le nom special qu'il lui donna en garda la trace--entierement particulier et nouveau. Maintenant, tous les soirs, quand il l'avait ramenee chez elle, il fallait qu'il entrat et souvent elle ressortait en robe de chambre et le conduisait jusqu'a sa voiture, l'embrassait aux yeux du cocher, disant: Qu'est-ce que cela peut me faire, que me font les autres? Les soirs ou il n'allait pas chez les Verdurin (ce qui arrivait parfois depuis qu'il pouvait la voir autrement), les soirs de plus en plus rares ou il allait dans le monde, elle lui demandait de venir chez elle avant de rentrer, quelque heure qu'il fut. C'etait le printemps, un printemps pur et glace. En sortant de soiree, il montait dans sa victoria, etendait une couverture sur ses jambes, repondait aux amis qui s'en allaient en meme temps que lui et lui demandaient de revenir avec eux qu'il ne pouvait pas, qu'il n'allait pas du meme cote, et le cocher partait au grand trot sachant ou on allait. Eux s'etonnaient, et de fait, Swann n'etait plus le meme. On ne recevait plus jamais de lettre de lui ou il demandat a connaitre une femme. Il ne faisait plus attention a aucune, s'abstenait d'aller dans les endroits ou on en rencontre. Dans un restaurant, a la campagne, il avait l'attitude inversee de celle a quoi, hier encore, on l'eut reconnu et qui avait semble devoir toujours etre la sienne. Tant une passion est en nous comme un caractere momentane et different qui se substitue a l'autre et abolit les signes jusque-la invariables par lesquels il s'exprimait! En revanche ce qui etait invariable maintenant, c'etait que ou que Swann se trouvat, il ne manquat pas d'aller rejoindre Odette. Le trajet qui le separait d'elle etait celui qu'il parcourait inevitablement et comme la pente meme irresistible et rapide de sa vie. A vrai dire, souvent reste tard dans le monde, il aurait mieux aime rentrer directement chez lui sans faire cette longue course et ne la voir que le lendemain; mais le fait meme de se deranger a une heure anormale pour aller chez elle, de deviner que les amis qui le quittaient se disaient: Il est tres tenu, il y a certainement une femme qui le force a aller chez elle a n'importe quelle heure, lui faisait sentir qu'il menait la vie des hommes qui ont une affaire amoureuse dans leur existence, et en qui le sacrifice qu'ils font de leur repos et de leurs interets a une reverie voluptueuse fait naitre un charme interieur. Puis sans qu'il s'en rendit compte, cette certitude qu'elle l'attendait, qu'elle n'etait pas ailleurs avec d'autres, qu'il ne reviendrait pas sans l'avoir vue, neutralisait cette angoisse oubliee mais toujours prete a renaitre qu'il avait eprouvee le soir ou Odette n'etait plus chez les Verdurin et dont l'apaisement actuel etait si doux que cela pouvait s'appeler du bonheur. Peut-etre etait-ce a cette angoisse qu'il etait redevable de l'importance qu'Odette avait prise pour lui. Les etres nous sont d'habitude si indifferents, que quand nous avons mis dans l'un d'eux de telles possibilites de souffrance et de joie, pour nous il nous semble appartenir a un autre univers, il s'entoure de poesie, il fait de notre vie comme une etendue emouvante ou il sera plus ou moins rapproche de nous. Swann ne pouvait se demander sans trouble ce qu'Odette deviendrait pour lui dans les annees qui allaient venir. Parfois, en voyant, de sa victoria, dans ces belles nuits froides,",3.836253022194572,1.6018179615793255,0.3221145651344165,0.10044180889730268,4.487523992322457,4.0,2.4835358977165005,25.62295081967213,19.0,23.018997097142115,1.2859884836852207,1.0,0.6191459805480923,1563,597,0.381957773512476,8157,61,26.060674424379656,207973067352.06317,107147381.42816238,0.7451043277978897,0.7595171140412152,72.03307919826314,9.577614927157736,10.480003223191101,12.833953200549596,12.517713413674834,9.431426743442096,46.41629694891077,5.327868852459017,True,57.0,0.871200412158681,4.202472952086553,1941.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004482020984007335,0.0036671080778241825,0.0,0.12622359608449252,54,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"vie d'Odette pendant le reste du temps, comme il n'en connaissait rien, lui apparaissait avec son fond neutre et sans couleur, semblable a ces feuilles d'etudes de Watteau, ou on voit ca et la, a toutes les places, dans tous les sens, dessines aux trois crayons sur le papier chamois, d'innombrables sourires. Mais, parfois, dans un coin de cette vie que Swann voyait toute vide, si meme son esprit lui disait qu'elle ne l'etait pas, parce qu'il ne pouvait pas l'imaginer, quelque ami, qui, se doutant qu'ils s'aimaient, ne se fut pas risque a lui rien dire d'elle que d'insignifiant, lui decrivait la silhouette d'Odette, qu'il avait apercue, le matin meme, montant a pied la rue Abbatucci dans une visite garnie de skunks, sous un chapeau a la Rembrandt et un bouquet de violettes a son corsage. Ce simple croquis bouleversait Swann parce qu'il lui faisait tout d'un coup apercevoir qu'Odette avait une vie qui n'etait pas tout entiere a lui; il voulait savoir a qui elle avait cherche a plaire par cette toilette qu'il ne lui connaissait pas; il se promettait de lui demander ou elle allait, a ce moment-la, comme si dans toute la vie incolore,--presque inexistante, parce qu'elle lui etait invisible--, de sa maitresse, il n'y avait qu'une seule chose en dehors de tous ces sourires adresses a lui: sa demarche sous un chapeau a la Rembrandt, avec un bouquet de violettes au corsage. Sauf en lui demandant la petite phrase de Vinteuil au lieu de la Valse des Roses, Swann ne cherchait pas a lui faire jouer plutot des choses qu'il aimat, et pas plus en musique qu'en litterature, a corriger son mauvais gout. Il se rendait bien compte qu'elle n'etait pas intelligente. En lui disant qu'elle aimerait tant qu'il lui parlat des grands poetes, elle s'etait imagine qu'elle allait connaitre tout de suite des couplets heroiques et romanesques dans le genre de ceux du vicomte de Borelli, en plus emouvant encore. Pour Ver Meer de Delft, elle lui demanda s'il avait souffert par une femme, si c'etait une femme qui l'avait inspire, et Swann lui ayant avoue qu'on n'en savait rien, elle s'etait desinteressee de ce peintre. Elle disait souvent: Je crois bien, la poesie, naturellement, il n'y aurait rien de plus beau si c'etait vrai, si les poetes pensaient tout ce qu'ils disent. Mais bien souvent, il n'y a pas plus interesse que ces gens-la. J'en sais quelque chose, j'avais une amie qui a aime une espece de poete. Dans ses vers il ne parlait que de l'amour, du ciel, des etoiles. Ah! ce qu'elle a ete refaite! Il lui a croque plus de trois cent mille francs. Si alors Swann cherchait a lui apprendre en quoi consistait la beaute artistique, comment il fallait admirer les vers ou les tableaux, au bout d'un instant, elle cessait d'ecouter, disant: Oui... je ne me figurais pas que c'etait comme cela. Et il sentait qu'elle eprouvait une telle deception qu'il preferait mentir en lui disant que tout cela n'etait rien, que ce n'etait encore que des bagatelles, qu'il n'avait pas le temps d'aborder le fond, qu'il y avait autre chose. Mais elle lui disait vivement: Autre chose? quoi? Dis-le alors, mais il ne le disait pas, sachant combien cela lui paraitrait mince et different de ce qu'elle esperait, moins sensationnel et moins touchant, et craignant que, desillusionnee de l'art, elle ne le fut en meme temps de l'amour. Et en effet elle trouvait Swann, intellectuellement, inferieur a ce qu'elle aurait cru. Tu gardes toujours ton sang-froid, je ne peux te definir. Elle s'emerveillait davantage de son indifference a l'argent, de sa gentillesse pour chacun, de sa delicatesse. Et il arrive en effet souvent pour de plus grands que n'etait Swann, pour un savant, pour un artiste, quand il n'est pas meconnu par ceux qui l'entourent, que celui de leurs sentiments qui prouve que la superiorite de son intelligence s'est imposee a eux, ce n'est pas leur admiration pour ses idees, car elles leur echappent, mais leur respect pour sa bonte. C'est aussi du respect qu'inspirait a Odette la situation qu'avait Swann dans le monde, mais elle ne desirait pas qu'il cherchat a l'y faire recevoir. Peut-etre sentait-elle qu'il ne pourrait pas y reussir, et meme craignait-elle, que rien qu'en parlant d'elle, il ne provoquat des revelations qu'elle redoutait. Toujours est-il qu'elle lui avait fait promettre de ne jamais prononcer son nom. La raison pour laquelle elle ne voulait pas aller dans le monde, lui avait-elle dit, etait une brouille qu'elle avait eue autrefois avec une amie qui, pour se venger, avait ensuite dit du mal d'elle. Swann objectait: Mais tout le monde n'a pas connu ton amie. --Mais si, ca fait la tache d'huile, le monde est si mechant. D'une part Swann ne comprit pas cette histoire, mais d'autre part il savait que ces propositions: Le monde est si mechant, un propos calomnieux fait la tache d'huile, sont generalement tenues pour vraies; il devait y avoir des cas auxquels elles s'appliquaient. Celui d'Odette etait-il l'un de ceux-la? Il se le demandait, mais pas longtemps, car il etait sujet, lui aussi, a cette lourdeur d'esprit qui s'appesantissait sur son pere, quand il se posait un probleme difficile. D'ailleurs, ce monde qui faisait si peur a Odette, ne lui inspirait peut-etre pas de grands desirs, car pour qu'elle se le representat bien nettement, il etait trop eloigne de celui qu'elle connaissait. Pourtant, tout en etant restee a certains egards vraiment simple (elle avait par exemple garde pour amie une petite couturiere retiree dont elle grimpait presque chaque jour l'escalier raide, obscur et fetide), elle avait soif de chic, mais ne s'en faisait pas la meme idee que les gens du monde. Pour eux, le chic est une emanation de quelques personnes peu nombreuses qui le projettent jusqu'a un degre assez eloigne --et plus ou moins affaibli dans la mesure ou l'on est distant du centre de leur intimite--, dans le cercle de leurs amis ou des amis de leurs amis dont les noms forment une sorte de repertoire. Les gens du monde le possedent dans leur memoire, ils ont sur ces matieres une erudition d'ou ils ont extrait une sorte de gout, de tact, si bien que Swann par exemple, sans avoir besoin de faire appel a son savoir mondain, s'il lisait dans un journal les noms des personnes qui se trouvaient a un diner pouvait dire immediatement la nuance du chic de ce diner, comme un lettre, a la simple lecture d'une phrase, apprecie exactement la qualite litteraire de son auteur. Mais Odette faisait partie des personnes (extremement nombreuses quoi qu'en pensent les gens du monde, et comme il y en a dans toutes les classes de la societe), qui ne possedent pas ces notions, imaginent un chic tout autre, qui revet divers aspects selon le milieu auquel elles appartiennent, mais a pour caractere particulier,--que ce soit celui dont revait Odette, ou celui devant lequel s'inclinait Mme Cottard,--d'etre directement accessible a tous. L'autre, celui des gens du monde, l'est a vrai dire aussi, mais il y faut quelque delai. Odette disait de quelqu'un: --Il ne va jamais que dans les endroits chics. Et si Swann lui demandait ce qu'elle entendait par la, elle lui repondait avec un peu de mepris: --Mais les endroits chics, parbleu! Si, a ton age, il faut t'apprendre ce que c'est que les endroits chics, que veux-tu que je te dise, moi, par exemple, le dimanche matin, l'avenue de l'Imperatrice, a cinq heures le tour du Lac, le jeudi l'Eden Theatre, le vendredi l'Hippodrome, les bals... --Mais quels bals? --Mais les bals qu'on donne a Paris, les bals chics, je veux dire. Tiens, Herbinger, tu sais, celui qui est chez un coulissier? mais si, tu dois savoir, c'est un des hommes les plus lances de Paris, ce grand jeune homme blond qui est tellement snob, il a toujours une fleur a la boutonniere, une raie dans le dos, des paletots clairs; il est avec ce vieux tableau qu'il promene a toutes les premieres. Eh bien! il a donne un bal, l'autre soir, il y avait tout ce qu'il y a de chic a Paris. Ce que j'aurais aime y aller! mais il fallait presenter sa carte d'invitation a la porte et je n'avais pas pu en avoir. Au fond j'aime autant ne pas y etre allee, c'etait une tuerie, je n'aurais rien vu. C'est plutot pour pouvoir dire qu'on etait chez Herbinger. Et tu sais, moi, la gloriole! Du reste, tu peux bien te dire que sur cent qui racontent qu'elles y etaient, il y a bien la moitie dont ca n'est pas vrai... Mais ca m'etonne que toi, un homme si pschutt, tu n'y etais pas. Mais Swann ne cherchait nullement a lui faire modifier cette conception du chic; pensant que la sienne n'etait pas plus vraie, etait aussi sotte, denuee d'importance, il ne trouvait aucun interet a en instruire sa maitresse, si bien qu'apres des mois elle ne s'interessait aux personnes chez qui il allait que pour les cartes de pesage, de concours hippique, les billets de premiere qu'il pouvait avoir par elles. Elle souhaitait qu'il cultivat des relations si utiles mais elle etait par ailleurs, portee a les croire peu chic, depuis qu'elle avait vu passer dans la rue la marquise de Villeparisis en robe de laine noire, avec un bonnet a brides. --Mais elle a l'air d'une ouvreuse, d'une vieille concierge, darling! Ca, une marquise! Je ne suis pas marquise, mais il faudrait me payer bien cher pour me faire sortir nippee comme ca! Elle ne comprenait pas que Swann habitat l'hotel du quai d'Orleans que, sans oser le lui avouer, elle trouvait indigne de lui. Certes, elle avait la pretention d'aimer les antiquites et prenait un air ravi et fin pour dire qu'elle adorait passer toute une journee a bibeloter, a chercher du bric-a-brac, des choses du temps. Bien qu'elle s'entetat dans une sorte de point d'honneur (et semblat pratiquer",3.5384466831079173,1.6016830151089358,0.33338035633115304,0.11018465629637651,4.386970684039088,4.0,2.4864636025282127,22.91044776119403,15.0,20.517725386196943,1.2807817589576547,1.0,0.6456989051789922,1535,575,0.3745928338762215,8008,67,30.148443327916485,12396599634588.613,6386707694.275432,0.6768900130480302,0.6409557991876051,75.22675871457048,8.458299382565997,9.563632477884871,11.379162817832661,10.687855802421119,8.703400651465799,41.73780932471195,4.313432835820896,True,69.0,0.865533230293663,4.125708397733128,1941.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01075713694662805,0.006206040546131568,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004137360364087712,0.005378568473314025,0.0,0.12158681092220505,56,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"devenaient plus serieuses, plus profondes, plus vitales, quand ces plaisirs l'etaient aussi. Comme Mme Verdurin donnait parfois a Swann ce qui seul pouvait constituer pour lui le bonheur; comme, tel soir ou il se sentait anxieux parce qu'Odette avait cause avec un invite plus qu'avec un autre, et ou, irrite contre elle, il ne voulait pas prendre l'initiative de lui demander si elle reviendrait avec lui, Mme Verdurin lui apportait la paix et la joie en disant spontanement: Odette, vous allez ramener M. Swann, n'est-ce pas? comme cet ete qui venait et ou il s'etait d'abord demande avec inquietude si Odette ne s'absenterait pas sans lui, s'il pourrait continuer a la voir tous les jours, Mme Verdurin allait les inviter a le passer tous deux chez elle a la campagne,--Swann laissant a son insu la reconnaissance et l'interet s'infiltrer dans son intelligence et influer sur ses idees, allait jusqu'a proclamer que Mme Verdurin etait une grande ame. De quelques gens exquis ou eminents que tel de ses anciens camarades de l'ecole du Louvre lui parlat: Je prefere cent fois les Verdurin, lui repondait-il. Et, avec une solennite qui etait nouvelle chez lui: Ce sont des etres magnanimes, et la magnanimite est, au fond, la seule chose qui importe et qui distingue ici-bas. Vois-tu, il n'y a que deux classes d'etres: les magnanimes et les autres; et je suis arrive a un age ou il faut prendre parti, decider une fois pour toutes qui on veut aimer et qui on veut dedaigner, se tenir a ceux qu'on aime et, pour reparer le temps qu'on a gache avec les autres, ne plus les quitter jusqu'a sa mort. Eh bien! ajoutait-il avec cette legere emotion qu'on eprouve quand meme sans bien s'en rendre compte, on dit une chose non parce qu'elle est vraie, mais parce qu'on a plaisir a la dire et qu'on l'ecoute dans sa propre voix comme si elle venait d'ailleurs que de nous-memes, le sort en est jete, j'ai choisi d'aimer les seuls curs magnanimes et de ne plus vivre que dans la magnanimite. Tu me demandes si Mme Verdurin est veritablement intelligente. Je t'assure qu'elle m'a donne les preuves d'une noblesse de cur, d'une hauteur d'ame ou, que veux-tu, on n'atteint pas sans une hauteur egale de pensee. Certes elle a la profonde intelligence des arts. Mais ce n'est peut-etre pas la qu'elle est le plus admirable; et telle petite action ingenieusement, exquisement bonne, qu'elle a accomplie pour moi, telle geniale attention, tel geste familierement sublime, revelent une comprehension plus profonde de l'existence que tous les traites de philosophie. Il aurait pourtant pu se dire qu'il y avait des anciens amis de ses parents aussi simples que les Verdurin, des camarades de sa jeunesse aussi epris d'art, qu'il connaissait d'autres etres d'un grand cur, et que, pourtant, depuis qu'il avait opte pour la simplicite, les arts et la magnanimite, il ne les voyait plus jamais. Mais ceux-la ne connaissaient pas Odette, et, s'ils l'avaient connue, ne se seraient pas soucies de la rapprocher de lui. Ainsi il n'y avait sans doute pas, dans tout le milieu Verdurin, un seul fidele qui les aimat ou crut les aimer autant que Swann. Et pourtant, quand M. Verdurin avait dit que Swann ne lui revenait pas, non seulement il avait exprime sa propre pensee, mais il avait devine celle de sa femme. Sans doute Swann avait pour Odette une affection trop particuliere et dont il avait neglige de faire de Mme Verdurin la confidente quotidienne: sans doute la discretion meme avec laquelle il usait de l'hospitalite des Verdurin, s'abstenant souvent de venir diner pour une raison qu'ils ne soupconnaient pas et a la place de laquelle ils voyaient le desir de ne pas manquer une invitation chez des ennuyeux, sans doute aussi, et malgre toutes les precautions qu'il avait prises pour la leur cacher, la decouverte progressive qu'ils faisaient de sa brillante situation mondaine, tout cela contribuait a leur irritation contre lui. Mais la raison profonde en etait autre. C'est qu'ils avaient tres vite senti en lui un espace reserve, impenetrable, ou il continuait a professer silencieusement pour lui-meme que la princesse de Sagan n'etait pas grotesque et que les plaisanteries de Cottard n'etaient pas droles, enfin et bien que jamais il ne se departit de son amabilite et ne se revoltat contre leurs dogmes, une impossibilite de les lui imposer, de l'y convertir entierement, comme ils n'en avaient jamais rencontre une pareille chez personne. Ils lui auraient pardonne de frequenter des ennuyeux (auxquels d'ailleurs, dans le fond de son cur, il preferait mille fois les Verdurin et tout le petit noyau) s'il avait consenti, pour le bon exemple, a les renier en presence des fideles. Mais c'est une abjuration qu'ils comprirent qu'on ne pourrait pas lui arracher. Quelle difference avec un nouveau qu'Odette leur avait demande d'inviter, quoiqu'elle ne l'eut rencontre que peu de fois, et sur lequel ils fondaient beaucoup d'espoir, le comte de Forcheville! (Il se trouva qu'il etait justement le beau-frere de Saniette, ce qui remplit d'etonnement les fideles: le vieil archiviste avait des manieres si humbles qu'ils l'avaient toujours cru d'un rang social inferieur au leur et ne s'attendaient pas a apprendre qu'il appartenait a un monde riche et relativement aristocratique.) Sans doute Forcheville etait grossierement snob, alors que Swann ne l'etait pas; sans doute il etait bien loin de placer, comme lui, le milieu des Verdurin au-dessus de tous les autres. Mais il n'avait pas cette delicatesse de nature qui empechait Swann de s'associer aux critiques trop manifestement fausses que dirigeait Mme Verdurin contre des gens qu'il connaissait. Quant aux tirades pretentieuses et vulgaires que le peintre lancait a certains jours, aux plaisanteries de commis voyageur que risquait Cottard et auxquelles Swann, qui les aimait l'un et l'autre, trouvait facilement des excuses mais n'avait pas le courage et l'hypocrisie d'applaudir, Forcheville etait au contraire d'un niveau intellectuel qui lui permettait d'etre abasourdi, emerveille par les unes, sans d'ailleurs les comprendre, et de se delecter aux autres. Et justement le premier diner chez les Verdurin auquel assista Forcheville, mit en lumiere toutes ces differences, fit ressortir ses qualites et precipita la disgrace de Swann. Il y avait, a ce diner, en dehors des habitues, un professeur de la Sorbonne, Brichot, qui avait rencontre M. et Mme Verdurin aux eaux et si ses fonctions universitaires et ses travaux d'erudition n'avaient pas rendu tres rares ses moments de liberte, serait volontiers venu souvent chez eux. Car il avait cette curiosite, cette superstition de la vie, qui unie a un certain scepticisme relatif a l'objet de leurs etudes, donne dans n'importe quelle profession, a certains hommes intelligents, medecins qui ne croient pas a la medecine, professeurs de lycee qui ne croient pas au theme latin, la reputation d'esprits larges, brillants, et meme superieurs. Il affectait, chez Mme Verdurin, de chercher ses comparaisons dans ce qu'il y avait de plus actuel quand il parlait de philosophie et d'histoire, d'abord parce qu'il croyait qu'elles ne sont qu'une preparation a la vie et qu'il s'imaginait trouver en action dans le petit clan ce qu'il n'avait connu jusqu'ici que dans les livres, puis peut-etre aussi parce que, s'etant vu inculquer autrefois, et ayant garde a son insu, le respect de certains sujets, il croyait depouiller l'universitaire en prenant avec eux des hardiesses qui, au contraire, ne lui paraissaient telles, que parce qu'il l'etait reste. Des le commencement du repas, comme M. de Forcheville, place a la droite de Mme Verdurin qui avait fait pour le nouveau de grands frais de toilette, lui disait: C'est original, cette robe blanche, le docteur qui n'avait cesse de l'observer, tant il etait curieux de savoir comment etait fait ce qu'il appelait un de, et qui cherchait une occasion d'attirer son attention et d'entrer plus en contact avec lui, saisit au vol le mot blanche et, sans lever le nez de son assiette, dit: blanche? Blanche de Castille? , puis sans bouger la tete lanca furtivement de droite et de gauche des regards incertains et souriants. Tandis que Swann, par l'effort douloureux et vain qu'il fit pour sourire, temoigna qu'il jugeait ce calembour stupide, Forcheville avait montre a la fois qu'il en goutait la finesse et qu'il savait vivre, en contenant dans de justes limites une gaiete dont la franchise avait charme Mme Verdurin. --Qu'est-ce que vous dites d'un savant comme cela? avait-elle demande a Forcheville. Il n'y a pas moyen de causer serieusement deux minutes avec lui. Est-ce que vous leur en dites comme cela, a votre hopital? avait-elle ajoute en se tournant vers le docteur, ca ne doit pas etre ennuyeux tous les jours, alors. Je vois qu'il va falloir que je demande a m'y faire admettre. --Je crois avoir entendu que le docteur parlait de cette vieille chipie de Blanche de Castille, si j'ose m'exprimer ainsi. N'est-il pas vrai, madame? demanda Brichot a Mme Verdurin qui, pamant, les yeux fermes, precipita sa figure dans ses mains d'ou s'echapperent des cris etouffes. Mon Dieu, Madame, je ne voudrais pas alarmer les ames respectueuses s'il y en a autour de cette table, sub rosa... Je reconnais d'ailleurs que notre ineffable republique athenienne--o combien!--pourrait honorer en cette capetienne obscurantiste le premier des prefets de police a poigne. Si fait, mon cher hote, si fait, reprit-il de sa voix bien timbree qui detachait chaque syllabe, en reponse a une objection de M. Verdurin. La chronique de Saint-Denis dont nous ne pouvons contester la surete d'information ne laisse aucun doute a cet egard. Nulle ne pourrait etre mieux choisie comme patronne par un proletariat laicisateur que cette mere d'un saint a qui elle en fit d'ailleurs voir de saumatres, comme dit Suger et autres saint Bernard; car avec elle chacun en prenait pour son grade. --Quel est ce monsieur? demanda Forcheville a Mme Verdurin, il a l'air d'etre de premiere force. --Comment, vous ne connaissez pas le fameux Brichot? il est celebre dans toute l'Europe. --Ah! c'est Brechot, s'ecria Forcheville qui n'avait",3.853342961864549,1.4968169244152447,0.34224279915119943,0.0823722680755939,4.713268608414239,4.0,2.7668843826132665,28.61111111111111,22.5,21.302422629281935,1.3553398058252428,1.0,0.7031682561848985,1545,628,0.4064724919093851,8486,54,25.95916832013684,187898605180.44962,98068165.54303215,0.7444542577525355,0.7730894742820126,63.13297464940669,11.561343042071197,11.820766666666668,14.680690399137001,15.075050701186619,10.879456310679608,53.14185544768069,7.018518518518518,True,50.0,0.8789144050104384,4.42901878914405,1916.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01537551744529864,0.0,0.0,0.14457202505219208,58,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"quelque precepte familial) en ne repondant jamais aux questions et en ne rendant pas de comptes sur l'emploi de ses journees, elle parla une fois a Swann d'une amie qui l'avait invitee et chez qui tout etait de l'epoque. Mais Swann ne put arriver a lui faire dire quelle etait cette epoque. Pourtant, apres avoir reflechi, elle repondit que c'etait moyenageux. Elle entendait par la qu'il y avait des boiseries. Quelque temps apres, elle lui reparla de son amie et ajouta, sur le ton hesitant et de l'air entendu dont on cite quelqu'un avec qui on a dine la veille et dont on n'avait jamais entendu le nom, mais que vos amphitryons avaient l'air de considerer comme quelqu'un de si celebre qu'on espere que l'interlocuteur saura bien de qui vous voulez parler: Elle a une salle a manger... du... dix-huitieme! Elle trouvait du reste cela affreux, nu, comme si la maison n'etait pas finie, les femmes y paraissaient affreuses et la mode n'en prendrait jamais. Enfin, une troisieme fois, elle en reparla et montra a Swann l'adresse de l'homme qui avait fait cette salle a manger et qu'elle avait envie de faire venir, quand elle aurait de l'argent pour voir s'il ne pourrait pas lui en faire, non pas certes une pareille, mais celle qu'elle revait et que, malheureusement, les dimensions de son petit hotel ne comportaient pas, avec de hauts dressoirs, des meubles Renaissance et des cheminees comme au chateau de Blois. Ce jour-la, elle laissa echapper devant Swann ce qu'elle pensait de son habitation du quai d'Orleans; comme il avait critique que l'amie d'Odette donnat non pas dans le Louis XVI, car, disait-il, bien que cela ne se fasse pas, cela peut etre charmant, mais dans le faux ancien: Tu ne voudrais pas qu'elle vecut comme toi au milieu de meubles casses et de tapis uses, lui dit-elle, le respect humain de la bourgeoise l'emportant encore chez elle sur le dilettantisme de la cocotte. De ceux qui aimaient a bibeloter, qui aimaient les vers, meprisaient les bas calculs, revaient d'honneur et d'amour, elle faisait une elite superieure au reste de l'humanite. Il n'y avait pas besoin qu'on eut reellement ces gouts pourvu qu'on les proclamat; d'un homme qui lui avait avoue a diner qu'il aimait a flaner, a se salir les doigts dans les vieilles boutiques, qu'il ne serait jamais apprecie par ce siecle commercial, car il ne se souciait pas de ses interets et qu'il etait pour cela d'un autre temps, elle revenait en disant: Mais c'est une ame adorable, un sensible, je ne m'en etais jamais doutee! et elle se sentait pour lui une immense et soudaine amitie. Mais, en revanche ceux, qui comme Swann, avaient ces gouts, mais n'en parlaient pas, la laissaient froide. Sans doute elle etait obligee d'avouer que Swann ne tenait pas a l'argent, mais elle ajoutait d'un air boudeur: Mais lui, ca n'est pas la meme chose; et en effet, ce qui parlait a son imagination, ce n'etait pas la pratique du desinteressement, c'en etait le vocabulaire. Sentant que souvent il ne pouvait pas realiser ce qu'elle revait, il cherchait du moins a ce qu'elle se plut avec lui, a ne pas contrecarrer ces idees vulgaires, ce mauvais gout qu'elle avait en toutes choses, et qu'il aimait d'ailleurs comme tout ce qui venait d'elle, qui l'enchantaient meme, car c'etait autant de traits particuliers grace auxquels l'essence de cette femme lui apparaissait, devenait visible. Aussi, quand elle avait l'air heureux parce qu'elle devait aller a la Reine Topaze, ou que son regard devenait serieux, inquiet et volontaire, si elle avait peur de manquer la rite des fleurs ou simplement l'heure du the, avec muffins et toasts, au The de la Rue Royale ou elle croyait que l'assiduite etait indispensable pour consacrer la reputation d'elegance d'une femme, Swann, transporte comme nous le sommes par le naturel d'un enfant ou par la verite d'un portrait qui semble sur le point de parler, sentait si bien l'ame de sa maitresse affleurer a son visage qu'il ne pouvait resister a venir l'y toucher avec ses levres. Ah! elle veut qu'on la mene a la fete des fleurs, la petite Odette, elle veut se faire admirer, eh bien, on l'y menera, nous n'avons qu'a nous incliner. Comme la vue de Swann etait un peu basse, il dut se resigner a se servir de lunettes pour travailler chez lui, et a adopter, pour aller dans le monde, le monocle qui le defigurait moins. La premiere fois qu'elle lui en vit un dans l'il, elle ne put contenir sa joie: Je trouve que pour un homme, il n'y a pas a dire, ca a beaucoup de chic! Comme tu es bien ainsi! tu as l'air d'un vrai gentleman. Il ne te manque qu'un titre! ajouta-t-elle, avec une nuance de regret. Il aimait qu'Odette fut ainsi, de meme que, s'il avait ete epris d'une Bretonne, il aurait ete heureux de la voir en coiffe et de lui entendre dire qu'elle croyait aux revenants. Jusque-la, comme beaucoup d'hommes chez qui leur gout pour les arts se developpe independamment de la sensualite, une disparate bizarre avait existe entre les satisfactions qu'il accordait a l'un et a l'autre, jouissant, dans la compagnie de femmes de plus en plus grossieres, des seductions d'uvres de plus en plus raffinees, emmenant une petite bonne dans une baignoire grillee a la representation d'une piece decadente qu'il avait envie d'entendre ou a une exposition de peinture impressionniste, et persuade d'ailleurs qu'une femme du monde cultivee n'y eut pas compris davantage, mais n'aurait pas su se taire aussi gentiment. Mais, au contraire, depuis qu'il aimait Odette, sympathiser avec elle, tacher de n'avoir qu'une ame a eux deux lui etait si doux, qu'il cherchait a se plaire aux choses qu'elle aimait, et il trouvait un plaisir d'autant plus profond non seulement a imiter ses habitudes, mais a adopter ses opinions, que, comme elles n'avaient aucune racine dans sa propre intelligence, elles lui rappelaient seulement son amour, a cause duquel il les avait preferees. S'il retournait a Serge Panine, s'il recherchait les occasions d'aller voir conduire Olivier Metra, c'etait pour la douceur d'etre initie dans toutes les conceptions d'Odette, de se sentir de moitie dans tous ses gouts. Ce charme de le rapprocher d'elle, qu'avaient les ouvrages ou les lieux qu'elle aimait, lui semblait plus mysterieux que celui qui est intrinseque a de plus beaux, mais qui ne la lui rappelaient pas. D'ailleurs, ayant laisse s'affaiblir les croyances intellectuelles de sa jeunesse, et son scepticisme d'homme du monde ayant a son insu penetre jusqu'a elles, il pensait (ou du moins il avait si longtemps pense cela qu'il le disait encore) que les objets de nos gouts n'ont pas en eux une valeur absolue, mais que tout est affaire d'epoque, de classe, consiste en modes, dont les plus vulgaires valent celles qui passent pour les plus distinguees. Et comme il jugeait que l'importance attachee par Odette a avoir des cartes pour le vernissage n'etait pas en soi quelque chose de plus ridicule que le plaisir qu'il avait autrefois a dejeuner chez le prince de Galles, de meme, il ne pensait pas que l'admiration qu'elle professait pour Monte-Carlo ou pour le Righi fut plus deraisonnable que le gout qu'il avait, lui, pour la Hollande qu'elle se figurait laide et pour Versailles qu'elle trouvait triste. Aussi, se privait-il d'y aller, ayant plaisir a se dire que c'etait pour elle, qu'il voulait ne sentir, n'aimer qu'avec elle. Comme tout ce qui environnait Odette et n'etait en quelque sorte que le mode selon lequel il pouvait la voir, causer avec elle, il aimait la societe des Verdurin. La, comme au fond de tous les divertissements, repas, musique, jeux, soupers costumes, parties de campagne, parties de theatre, meme les rares grandes soirees donnees pour les ennuyeux, il y avait la presence d'Odette, la vue d'Odette, la conversation avec Odette, dont les Verdurin faisaient a Swann, en l'invitant, le don inestimable, il se plaisait mieux que partout ailleurs dans le petit noyau, et cherchait a lui attribuer des merites reels, car il s'imaginait ainsi que par gout il le frequenterait toute sa vie. Or, n'osant pas se dire, par peur de ne pas le croire, qu'il aimerait toujours Odette, du moins en cherchant a supposer qu'il frequenterait toujours les Verdurin (proposition qui, a priori, soulevait moins d'objections de principe de la part de son intelligence), il se voyait dans l'avenir continuant a rencontrer chaque soir Odette; cela ne revenait peut-etre pas tout a fait au meme que l'aimer toujours, mais, pour le moment, pendant qu'il l'aimait, croire qu'il ne cesserait pas un jour de la voir, c'est tout ce qu'il demandait. Quel charmant milieu, se disait-il. Comme c'est au fond la vraie vie qu'on mene la! Comme on y est plus intelligent, plus artiste que dans le monde. Comme Mme Verdurin, malgre de petites exagerations un peu risibles, a un amour sincere de la peinture, de la musique! quelle passion pour les uvres, quel desir de faire plaisir aux artistes! Elle se fait une idee inexacte des gens du monde; mais avec cela que le monde n'en a pas une plus fausse encore des milieux artistes! Peut-etre n'ai-je pas de grands besoins intellectuels a assouvir dans la conversation, mais je me plais parfaitement bien avec Cottard, quoiqu'il fasse des calembours ineptes. Et quant au peintre, si sa pretention est deplaisante quand il cherche a etonner, en revanche c'est une des plus belles intelligences que j'aie connues. Et puis surtout, la, on se sent libre, on fait ce qu'on veut sans contrainte, sans ceremonie. Quelle depense de bonne humeur il se fait par jour dans ce salon-la! Decidement, sauf quelques rares exceptions, je n'irai plus jamais que dans ce milieu. C'est la que j'aurai de plus en plus mes habitudes et ma vie. Et comme les qualites qu'il croyait intrinseques aux Verdurin n'etaient que le reflet sur eux de plaisirs qu'avait goutes chez eux son amour pour Odette, ces qualites",3.9569436663355604,1.3283894373440457,0.3512151049910575,0.07477340744593396,4.525,4.0,2.6118467453226715,30.4,23.0,24.560130292814,1.2953947368421053,1.0,0.6232173330250254,1520,589,0.3875,8168,50,28.533956687780204,2466834061110.1045,1283472456.3528118,0.7844203826116056,0.7817232478410006,66.38860526315791,11.551657894736845,10.53366545652748,14.370526315789474,15.082749999999997,9.833315789473687,51.189473684210526,6.32,True,70.0,0.8735691987513007,4.249739854318419,1922.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006715506715506716,0.0030525030525030525,0.004578754578754579,0.12330905306971904,57,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pas bien entendu, vous m'en direz tant, ajouta-t-il tout en attachant sur l'homme celebre des yeux ecarquilles. C'est toujours interessant de diner avec un homme en vue. Mais, dites-moi, vous nous invitez-la avec des convives de choix. On ne s'ennuie pas chez vous. --Oh! vous savez ce qu'il y a surtout, dit modestement Mme Verdurin, c'est qu'ils se sentent en confiance. Ils parlent de ce qu'ils veulent, et la conversation rejaillit en fusees. Ainsi Brichot, ce soir, ce n'est rien: je l'ai vu, vous savez, chez moi, eblouissant, a se mettre a genoux devant; eh bien! chez les autres, ce n'est plus le meme homme, il n'a plus d'esprit, il faut lui arracher les mots, il est meme ennuyeux. --C'est curieux! dit Forcheville etonne. Un genre d'esprit comme celui de Brichot aurait ete tenu pour stupidite pure dans la coterie ou Swann avait passe sa jeunesse, bien qu'il soit compatible avec une intelligence reelle. Et celle du professeur, vigoureuse et bien nourrie, aurait probablement pu etre enviee par bien des gens du monde que Swann trouvait spirituels. Mais ceux-ci avaient fini par lui inculquer si bien leurs gouts et leurs repugnances, au moins en tout ce qui touche a la vie mondaine et meme en celle de ses parties annexes qui devrait plutot relever du domaine de l'intelligence: la conversation, que Swann ne put trouver les plaisanteries de Brichot que pedantesques, vulgaires et grasses a ecurer. Puis il etait choque, dans l'habitude qu'il avait des bonnes manieres, par le ton rude et militaire qu'affectait, en s'adressant a chacun, l'universitaire cocardier. Enfin, peut-etre avait-il surtout perdu, ce soir-la, de son indulgence en voyant l'amabilite que Mme Verdurin deployait pour ce Forcheville qu'Odette avait eu la singuliere idee d'amener. Un peu genee vis-a-vis de Swann, elle lui avait demande en arrivant: --Comment trouvez-vous mon invite? Et lui, s'apercevant pour la premiere fois que Forcheville qu'il connaissait depuis longtemps pouvait plaire a une femme et etait assez bel homme, avait repondu: Immonde! Certes, il n'avait pas l'idee d'etre jaloux d'Odette, mais il ne se sentait pas aussi heureux que d'habitude et quand Brichot, ayant commence a raconter l'histoire de la mere de Blanche de Castille qui avait ete avec Henri Plantagenet des annees avant de l'epouser, voulut s'en faire demander la suite par Swann en lui disant: n'est-ce pas, monsieur Swann? sur le ton martial qu'on prend pour se mettre a la portee d'un paysan ou pour donner du cur a un troupier, Swann coupa l'effet de Brichot a la grande fureur de la maitresse de la maison, en repondant qu'on voulut bien l'excuser de s'interesser si peu a Blanche de Castille, mais qu'il avait quelque chose a demander au peintre. Celui-ci, en effet, etait alle dans l'apres-midi visiter l'exposition d'un artiste, ami de Mme Verdurin qui etait mort recemment, et Swann aurait voulu savoir par lui (car il appreciait son gout) si vraiment il y avait dans ces dernieres uvres plus que la virtuosite qui stupefiait deja dans les precedentes. --A ce point de vue-la, c'etait extraordinaire, mais cela ne semblait pas d'un art, comme on dit, tres eleve, dit Swann en souriant. --Eleve... a la hauteur d'une institution, interrompit Cottard en levant les bras avec une gravite simulee. Toute la table eclata de rire. --Quand je vous disais qu'on ne peut pas garder son serieux avec lui, dit Mme Verdurin a Forcheville. Au moment ou on s'y attend le moins, il vous sort une calembredaine. Mais elle remarqua que seul Swann ne s'etait pas deride. Du reste il n'etait pas tres content que Cottard fit rire de lui devant Forcheville. Mais le peintre, au lieu de repondre d'une facon interessante a Swann, ce qu'il eut probablement fait s'il eut ete seul avec lui, prefera se faire admirer des convives en placant un morceau sur l'habilete du maitre disparu. --Je me suis approche, dit-il, pour voir comment c'etait fait, j'ai mis le nez dessus. Ah! bien ouiche! on ne pourrait pas dire si c'est fait avec de la colle, avec du rubis, avec du savon, avec du bronze, avec du soleil, avec du caca! --Et un font douze, s'ecria trop tard le docteur dont personne ne comprit l'interruption. --Ca a l'air fait avec rien, reprit le peintre, pas plus moyen de decouvrir le truc que dans la Ronde ou les Regentes et c'est encore plus fort comme patte que Rembrandt et que Hals. Tout y est, mais non, je vous jure. Et comme les chanteurs parvenus a la note la plus haute qu'ils puissent donner continuent en voix de tete, piano, il se contenta de murmurer, et en riant, comme si en effet cette peinture eut ete derisoire a force de beaute: --Ca sent bon, ca vous prend a la tete, ca vous coupe la respiration, ca vous fait des chatouilles, et pas meche de savoir avec quoi c'est fait, c'en est sorcier, c'est de la rouerie, c'est du miracle (eclatant tout a fait de rire): c'en est malhonnete! En s'arretant, redressant gravement la tete, prenant une note de basse profonde qu'il tacha de rendre harmonieuse, il ajouta: et c'est si loyal! Sauf au moment ou il avait dit: plus fort que la Ronde, blaspheme qui avait provoque une protestation de Mme Verdurin qui tenait la Ronde pour le plus grand chef-d'uvre de l'univers avec la Neuvieme et la Samothrace, et a: fait avec du caca qui avait fait jeter a Forcheville un coup d'il circulaire sur la table pour voir si le mot passait et avait ensuite amene sur sa bouche un sourire prude et conciliant, tous les convives, excepte Swann, avaient attache sur le peintre des regards fascines par l'admiration. --Ce qu'il m'amuse quand il s'emballe comme ca, s'ecria, quand il eut termine, Mme Verdurin, ravie que la table fut justement si interessante le jour ou M. de Forcheville venait pour la premiere fois. Et toi, qu'est-ce que tu as a rester comme cela, bouche bee comme une grande bete? dit-elle a son mari. Tu sais pourtant qu'il parle bien; on dirait que c'est la premiere fois qu'il vous entend. Si vous l'aviez vu pendant que vous parliez, il vous buvait. Et demain il nous recitera tout ce que vous avez dit sans manger un mot. --Mais non, c'est pas de la blague, dit le peintre, enchante de son succes, vous avez l'air de croire que je fais le boniment, que c'est du chique; je vous y menerai voir, vous direz si j'ai exagere, je vous fiche mon billet que vous revenez plus emballee que moi! --Mais nous ne croyons pas que vous exagerez, nous voulons seulement que vous mangiez, et que mon mari mange aussi; redonnez de la sole normande a Monsieur, vous voyez bien que la sienne est froide. Nous ne sommes pas si presses, vous servez comme s'il y avait le feu, attendez donc un peu pour donner la salade. Mme Cottard qui etait modeste et parlait peu, savait pourtant ne pas manquer d'assurance quand une heureuse inspiration lui avait fait trouver un mot juste. Elle sentait qu'il aurait du succes, cela la mettait en confiance, et ce qu'elle en faisait etait moins pour briller que pour etre utile a la carriere de son mari. Aussi ne laissa-t-elle pas echapper le mot de salade que venait de prononcer Mme Verdurin. --Ce n'est pas de la salade japonaise? dit-elle a mi-voix en se tournant vers Odette. Et ravie et confuse de l'a-propos et de la hardiesse qu'il y avait a faire ainsi une allusion discrete, mais claire, a la nouvelle et retentissante piece de Dumas, elle eclata d'un rire charmant d'ingenue, peu bruyant, mais si irresistible qu'elle resta quelques instants sans pouvoir le maitriser. Qui est cette dame? elle a de l'esprit, dit Forcheville. --Non, mais nous vous en ferons si vous venez tous diner vendredi. --Je vais vous paraitre bien provinciale, monsieur, dit Mme Cottard a Swann, mais je n'ai pas encore vu cette fameuse Francillon dont tout le monde parle. Le docteur y est alle (je me rappelle meme qu'il m'a dit avoir eu le tres grand plaisir de passer la soiree avec vous) et j'avoue que je n'ai pas trouve raisonnable qu'il louat des places pour y retourner avec moi. Evidemment, au Theatre-Francais, on ne regrette jamais sa soiree, c'est toujours si bien joue, mais comme nous avons des amis tres aimables (Mme Cottard prononcait rarement un nom propre et se contentait de dire des amis a nous, une de mes amies, par distinction, sur un ton factice, et avec l'air d'importance d'une personne qui ne nomme que qui elle veut) qui ont souvent des loges et ont la bonne idee de nous emmener a toutes les nouveautes qui en valent la peine, je suis toujours sure de voir Francillon un peu plus tot ou un peu plus tard, et de pouvoir me former une opinion. Je dois pourtant confesser que je me trouve assez sotte, car, dans tous les salons ou je vais en visite, on ne parle naturellement que de cette malheureuse salade japonaise. On commence meme a en etre un peu fatigue, ajouta-t-elle en voyant que Swann n'avait pas l'air aussi interesse qu'elle aurait cru par une si brulante actualite. Il faut avouer pourtant que cela donne quelquefois pretexte a des idees assez amusantes. Ainsi j'ai une de mes amies qui est tres originale, quoique tres jolie femme, tres entouree, tres lancee, et qui pretend qu'elle a fait faire chez elle cette salade japonaise, mais en faisant mettre tout ce qu'Alexandre Dumas fils dit dans la piece. Elle avait invite quelques amies a venir en manger. Malheureusement je n'etais pas des elues. Mais elle nous l'a raconte tantot, a son jour; il parait que c'etait detestable, elle nous a fait rire aux larmes. Mais vous savez, tout est dans la maniere de raconter, dit-elle en voyant que Swann gardait un air grave. Et supposant que c'etait peut-etre parce qu'il n'aimait pas Francillon: --Du reste, je crois que j'aurai une deception. Je ne crois",3.3188945507022614,1.498426184521804,0.3485569980656385,0.13146371910046056,4.395408163265306,4.0,2.434976707916654,20.63157894736842,17.0,17.247304980369325,1.2869897959183674,1.0,0.6148951461120857,1568,599,0.382015306122449,7972,76,28.64821667471822,2765428397533.143,1412374053.8984387,0.6278849948445956,0.6459121027760006,77.01461063372719,7.642795381310421,9.516144504307135,10.67610096670247,9.5881619226638,8.610306122448979,39.891783029001076,3.973684210526316,True,62.0,0.86414708886619,4.07150153217569,1958.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00986295681063123,0.005191029900332226,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004152823920265781,0.004671926910299004,0.0,0.1261491317671093,59,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"raison qu'il venait de l'inventer il y avait un moment. Cet excellent homme souffrait d'etre trouve si ennuyeux par les Verdurin; et ayant conscience d'avoir ete plus terne encore a ce diner que d'habitude, il n'avait voulu le laisser finir sans avoir reussi a amuser. Il capitula si vite, eut l'air si malheureux de voir manque l'effet sur lequel il avait compte et repondit d'un ton si lache a Swann pour que celui-ci ne s'acharnat pas a une refutation desormais inutile: C'est bon, c'est bon; en tous cas, meme si je me trompe, ce n'est pas un crime, je pense que Swann aurait voulu pouvoir dire que l'histoire etait vraie et delicieuse. Le docteur qui les avait ecoutes eut l'idee que c'etait le cas de dire: Se non e vero, mais il n'etait pas assez sur des mots et craignit de s'embrouiller. Apres le diner Forcheville alla de lui-meme vers le docteur. --Elle n'a pas du etre mal, Mme Verdurin, et puis c'est une femme avec qui on peut causer, pour moi tout est la. Evidemment elle commence a avoir un peu de bouteille. Mais Mme de Crecy voila une petite femme qui a l'air intelligente, ah! saperlipopette, on voit tout de suite qu'elle a l'il americain, celle-la! Nous parlons de Mme de Crecy, dit-il a M. Verdurin qui s'approchait, la pipe a la bouche. Je me figure que comme corps de femme... --J'aimerais mieux l'avoir dans mon lit que le tonnerre, dit precipitamment Cottard qui depuis quelques instants attendait en vain que Forcheville reprit haleine pour placer cette vieille plaisanterie dont il craignait que ne revint pas l'a-propos si la conversation changeait de cours, et qu'il debita avec cet exces de spontaneite et d'assurance qui cherche a masquer la froideur et l'emoi inseparables d'une recitation. Forcheville la connaissait, il la comprit et s'en amusa. Quant a M. Verdurin, il ne marchanda pas sa gaiete, car il avait trouve depuis peu pour la signifier un symbole autre que celui dont usait sa femme, mais aussi simple et aussi clair. A peine avait-il commence a faire le mouvement de tete et d'epaules de quelqu'un qui s'esclaffe qu'aussitot il se mettait a tousser comme si, en riant trop fort, il avait avale la fumee de sa pipe. Et la gardant toujours au coin de sa bouche, il prolongeait indefiniment le simulacre de suffocation et d'hilarite. Ainsi lui et Mme Verdurin, qui en face, ecoutant le peintre qui lui racontait une histoire, fermait les yeux avant de precipiter son visage dans ses mains, avaient l'air de deux masques de theatre qui figuraient differemment la gaiete. M. Verdurin avait d'ailleurs fait sagement en ne retirant pas sa pipe de sa bouche, car Cottard qui avait besoin de s'eloigner un instant fit a mi-voix une plaisanterie qu'il avait apprise depuis peu et qu'il renouvelait chaque fois qu'il avait a aller au meme endroit: Il faut que j'aille entretenir un instant le duc d'Aumale, de sorte que la quinte de M. Verdurin recommenca. --Voyons, enleve donc ta pipe de ta bouche, tu vois bien que tu vas t'etouffer a te retenir de rire comme ca, lui dit Mme Verdurin qui venait offrir des liqueurs. --Quel homme charmant que votre mari, il a de l'esprit comme quatre, declara Forcheville a Mme Cottard. Merci madame. Un vieux troupier comme moi, ca ne refuse jamais la goutte. de Forcheville trouve Odette charmante, dit M. Verdurin a sa femme. --Mais justement elle voudrait dejeuner une fois avec vous. Nous allons combiner ca, mais il ne faut pas que Swann le sache. Vous savez, il met un peu de froid. Ca ne vous empechera pas de venir diner, naturellement, nous esperons vous avoir tres souvent. Avec la belle saison qui vient, nous allons souvent diner en plein air. Cela ne vous ennuie pas les petits diners au Bois? bien, bien, ce sera tres gentil. Est-ce que vous n'allez pas travailler de votre metier, vous! cria-t-elle au petit pianiste, afin de faire montre, devant un nouveau de l'importance de Forcheville, a la fois de son esprit et de son pouvoir tyrannique sur les fideles. de Forcheville etait en train de me dire du mal de toi, dit Mme Cottard a son mari quand il rentra au salon. Et lui, poursuivant l'idee de la noblesse de Forcheville qui l'occupait depuis le commencement du diner, lui dit: --Je soigne en ce moment une baronne, la baronne Putbus, les Putbus etaient aux Croisades, n'est-ce pas? Ils ont, en Pomeranie, un lac qui est grand comme dix fois la place de la Concorde. Je la soigne pour de l'arthrite seche, c'est une femme charmante. Elle connait du reste Mme Verdurin, je crois. Ce qui permit a Forcheville, quand il se retrouva, un moment apres, seul avec Mme Cottard, de completer le jugement favorable qu'il avait porte sur son mari: --Et puis il est interessant, on voit qu'il connait du monde. Dame, ca sait tant de choses, les medecins. --Je vais jouer la phrase de la Sonate pour M. Swann? dit le pianiste. --Ah! bigre! ce n'est pas au moins le Serpent a Sonates? demanda M. de Forcheville pour faire de l'effet. Mais le docteur Cottard, qui n'avait jamais entendu ce calembour, ne le comprit pas et crut a une erreur de M. de Forcheville. Il s'approcha vivement pour la rectifier: --Mais non, ce n'est pas serpent a sonates qu'on dit, c'est serpent a sonnettes, dit-il d'un ton zele, impatient et triomphal. Forcheville lui expliqua le calembour. Le docteur rougit. --Avouez qu'il est drole, docteur? --Oh! je le connais depuis si longtemps, repondit Cottard. Mais ils se turent; sous l'agitation des tremolos de violon qui la protegeaient de leur tenue fremissante a deux octaves de la--et comme dans un pays de montagne, derriere l'immobilite apparente et vertigineuse d'une cascade, on apercoit, deux cents pieds plus bas, la forme minuscule d'une promeneuse--la petite phrase venait d'apparaitre, lointaine, gracieuse, protegee par le long deferlement du rideau transparent, incessant et sonore. Et Swann, en son cur, s'adressa a elle comme a une confidente de son amour, comme a une amie d'Odette qui devrait bien lui dire de ne pas faire attention a ce Forcheville. --Ah! vous arrivez tard, dit Mme Verdurin a un fidele qu'elle n'avait invite qu'en cure-dents, nous avons eu un Brichot incomparable, d'une eloquence! Mais il est parti. N'est-ce pas, monsieur Swann? Je crois que c'est la premiere fois que vous vous rencontriez avec lui, dit-elle pour lui faire remarquer que c'etait a elle qu'il devait de le connaitre. N'est-ce pas, il a ete delicieux, notre Brichot? Swann s'inclina poliment. --Non? il ne vous a pas interesse? lui demanda sechement Mme Verdurin. --Mais si, madame, beaucoup, j'ai ete ravi. Il est peut-etre un peu peremptoire et un peu jovial pour mon gout. Je lui voudrais parfois un peu d'hesitations et de douceur, mais on sent qu'il sait tant de choses et il a l'air d'un bien brave homme. Tour le monde se retira fort tard. Les premiers mots de Cottard a sa femme furent: --J'ai rarement vu Mme Verdurin aussi en verve que ce soir. --Qu'est-ce que c'est exactement que cette Mme Verdurin, un demi-castor? dit Forcheville au peintre a qui il proposa de revenir avec lui. Odette le vit s'eloigner avec regret, elle n'osa pas ne pas revenir avec Swann, mais fut de mauvaise humeur en voiture, et quand il lui demanda s'il devait entrer chez elle, elle lui dit: Bien entendu en haussant les epaules avec impatience. Quand tous les invites furent partis, Mme Verdurin dit a son mari: --As-tu remarque comme Swann a ri d'un rire niais quand nous avons parle de Mme La Tremoille? Elle avait remarque que devant ce nom Swann et Forcheville avaient plusieurs fois supprime la particule. Ne doutant pas que ce fut pour montrer qu'ils n'etaient pas intimides par les titres, elle souhaitait d'imiter leur fierte, mais n'avait pas bien saisi par quelle forme grammaticale elle se traduisait. Aussi sa vicieuse facon de parler l'emportant sur son intransigeance republicaine, elle disait encore les de La Tremoille ou plutot par une abreviation en usage dans les paroles des chansons de cafe-concert et les legendes des caricaturistes et qui dissimulait le de, les d'La Tremoille, mais elle se rattrapait en disant: Madame La Tremoille. La Duchesse, comme dit Swann, ajouta-t-elle ironiquement avec un sourire qui prouvait qu'elle ne faisait que citer et ne prenait pas a son compte une denomination aussi naive et ridicule. --Je te dirai que je l'ai trouve extremement bete. Et M. Verdurin lui repondit: --Il n'est pas franc, c'est un monsieur cauteleux, toujours entre le zist et le zest. Il veut toujours menager la chevre et le chou. Quelle difference avec Forcheville. Voila au moins un homme qui vous dit carrement sa facon de penser. Ca vous plait ou ca ne vous plait pas. Ce n'est pas comme l'autre qui n'est jamais ni figue ni raisin. Du reste Odette a l'air de preferer joliment le Forcheville, et je lui donne raison. Et puis enfin puisque Swann veut nous la faire a l'homme du monde, au champion des duchesses, au moins l'autre a son titre; il est toujours comte de Forcheville, ajouta-t-il d'un air delicat, comme si, au courant de l'histoire de ce comte, il en soupesait minutieusement la valeur particuliere. --Je te dirai, dit Mme Verdurin, qu'il a cru devoir lancer contre Brichot quelques insinuations venimeuses et assez ridicules. Naturellement, comme il a vu que Brichot etait aime dans la maison, c'etait une maniere de nous atteindre, de becher notre diner. On sent le bon petit camarade qui vous debinera en sortant. --Mais je te l'ai dit, repondit M. Verdurin, c'est le rate, le petit individu envieux de tout ce qui est un peu grand. En realite il n'y avait pas un fidele qui ne fut plus malveillant que Swann; mais tous ils avaient la precaution d'assaisonner leurs medisances de plaisanteries connues, d'une petite pointe d'emotion et de cordialite; tandis que la moindre reserve que se permettait Swann,",3.254525367546944,1.6704849136867745,0.33728821101682355,0.13246738877992992,4.4636942675159235,4.0,2.6172420176856237,17.065217391304348,13.0,14.059504249273859,1.3292993630573249,1.0,0.6803671869717665,1570,592,0.37707006369426754,8093,92,29.31357530644606,5379278140361.719,2757190230.83635,0.6344647525635722,0.6130937294206685,77.05507823317642,6.75116726668513,9.54385415503706,9.781500969260593,8.126608695652173,8.711999999999996,37.574771531431736,3.5,True,65.0,0.8662224500256279,4.14812916453101,1951.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005331692812467958,0.0030759766225776685,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012303906490310674,0.006664616015584948,0.0,0.14607893388006152,61,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pas que cela vaille Serge Panine, l'idole de Mme de Crecy. Voila au moins des sujets qui ont du fond, qui font reflechir; mais donner une recette de salade sur la scene du Theatre-Francais! Tandis que Serge Panine! Du reste, comme tout ce qui vient de la plume de Georges Ohnet, c'est toujours si bien ecrit. Je ne sais pas si vous connaissez Le Maitre de Forges que je prefererais encore a Serge Panine. --Pardonnez-moi, lui dit Swann d'un air ironique, mais j'avoue que mon manque d'admiration est a peu pres egal pour ces deux chefs-d'uvre. --Vraiment, qu'est-ce que vous leur reprochez? Est-ce un parti pris? Trouvez-vous peut-etre que c'est un peu triste? D'ailleurs, comme je dis toujours, il ne faut jamais discuter sur les romans ni sur les pieces de theatre. Chacun a sa maniere de voir et vous pouvez trouver detestable ce que j'aime le mieux. Elle fut interrompue par Forcheville qui interpellait Swann. En effet, tandis que Mme Cottard parlait de Francillon, Forcheville avait exprime a Mme Verdurin son admiration pour ce qu'il avait appele le petit speech du peintre. --Monsieur a une facilite de parole, une memoire! avait-il dit a Mme Verdurin quand le peintre eut termine, comme j'en ai rarement rencontre. Bigre! je voudrais bien en avoir autant. Il ferait un excellent predicateur. On peut dire qu'avec M. Brechot, vous avez la deux numeros qui se valent, je ne sais meme pas si comme platine, celui-ci ne damerait pas encore le pion au professeur. Ca vient plus naturellement, c'est moins recherche. Quoiqu'il ait chemin faisant quelques mots un peu realistes, mais c'est le gout du jour, je n'ai pas souvent vu tenir le crachoir avec une pareille dexterite, comme nous disions au regiment, ou pourtant j'avais un camarade que justement monsieur me rappelait un peu. A propos de n'importe quoi, je ne sais que vous dire, sur ce verre, par exemple, il pouvait degoiser pendant des heures, non, pas a propos de ce verre, ce que je dis est stupide; mais a propos de la bataille de Waterloo, de tout ce que vous voudrez et il nous envoyait chemin faisant des choses auxquelles vous n'auriez jamais pense. Du reste Swann etait dans le meme regiment; il a du le connaitre. --Vous voyez souvent M. Swann? demanda Mme Verdurin. --Mais non, repondit M. de Forcheville et comme pour se rapprocher plus aisement d'Odette, il desirait etre agreable a Swann, voulant saisir cette occasion, pour le flatter, de parler de ses belles relations, mais d'en parler en homme du monde sur un ton de critique cordiale et n'avoir pas l'air de l'en feliciter comme d'un succes inespere: N'est-ce pas, Swann? je ne vous vois jamais. D'ailleurs, comment faire pour le voir? Cet animal-la est tout le temps fourre chez les La Tremoille, chez les Laumes, chez tout ca! Imputation d'autant plus fausse d'ailleurs que depuis un an Swann n'allait plus guere que chez les Verdurin. Mais le seul nom de personnes qu'ils ne connaissaient pas etait accueilli chez eux par un silence reprobateur. M. Verdurin, craignant la penible impression que ces noms d'ennuyeux, surtout lances ainsi sans tact a la face de tous les fideles, avaient du produire sur sa femme, jeta sur elle a la derobee un regard plein d'inquiete sollicitude. Il vit alors que dans sa resolution de ne pas prendre acte, de ne pas avoir ete touchee par la nouvelle qui venait de lui etre notifiee, de ne pas seulement rester muette, mais d'avoir ete sourde comme nous l'affectons, quand un ami fautif essaye de glisser dans la conversation une excuse que ce serait avoir l'air d'admettre que de l'avoir ecoutee sans protester, ou quand on prononce devant nous le nom defendu d'un ingrat, Mme Verdurin, pour que son silence n'eut pas l'air d'un consentement, mais du silence ignorant des choses inanimees, avait soudain depouille son visage de toute vie, de toute motilite; son front bombe n'etait plus qu'une belle etude de ronde bosse ou le nom de ces La Tremoille chez qui etait toujours fourre Swann, n'avait pu penetrer; son nez legerement fronce laissait voir une echancrure qui semblait calquee sur la vie. On eut dit que sa bouche entr'ouverte allait parler. Ce n'etait plus qu'une cire perdue, qu'un masque de platre, qu'une maquette pour un monument, qu'un buste pour le Palais de l'Industrie devant lequel le public s'arreterait certainement pour admirer comment le sculpteur, en exprimant l'imprescriptible dignite des Verdurin opposee a celle des La Tremoille et des Laumes qu'ils valent certes ainsi que tous les ennuyeux de la terre, etait arrive a donner une majeste presque papale a la blancheur et a la rigidite de la pierre. Mais le marbre finit par s'animer et fit entendre qu'il fallait ne pas etre degoute pour aller chez ces gens-la, car la femme etait toujours ivre et le mari si ignorant qu'il disait collidor pour corridor. --On me paierait bien cher que je ne laisserais pas entrer ca chez moi, conclut Mme Verdurin, en regardant Swann d'un air imperieux. Sans doute elle n'esperait pas qu'il se soumettrait jusqu'a imiter la sainte simplicite de la tante du pianiste qui venait de s'ecrier: --Voyez-vous ca? Ce qui m'etonne, c'est qu'ils trouvent encore des personnes qui consentent a leur causer; il me semble que j'aurais peur: un mauvais coup est si vite recu! Comment y a-t-il encore du peuple assez brute pour leur courir apres. Que ne repondait-il du moins comme Forcheville: Dame, c'est une duchesse; il y a des gens que ca impressionne encore, ce qui avait permis au moins a Mme Verdurin de repliquer: Grand bien leur fasse! Au lieu de cela, Swann se contenta de rire d'un air qui signifiait qu'il ne pouvait meme pas prendre au serieux une pareille extravagance. M. Verdurin, continuant a jeter sur sa femme des regards furtifs, voyait avec tristesse et comprenait trop bien qu'elle eprouvait la colere d'un grand inquisiteur qui ne parvient pas a extirper l'heresie, et pour tacher d'amener Swann a une retractation, comme le courage de ses opinions parait toujours un calcul et une lachete aux yeux de ceux a l'encontre de qui il s'exerce, M. Verdurin l'interpella: --Dites donc franchement votre pensee, nous n'irons pas le leur repeter. A quoi Swann repondit: --Mais ce n'est pas du tout par peur de la duchesse (si c'est des La Tremoille que vous parlez). Je vous assure que tout le monde aime aller chez elle. Je ne vous dis pas qu'elle soit profonde (il prononca profonde, comme si c'avait ete un mot ridicule, car son langage gardait la trace d'habitudes d'esprit qu'une certaine renovation, marquee par l'amour de la musique, lui avait momentanement fait perdre--il exprimait parfois ses opinions avec chaleur--) mais, tres sincerement, elle est intelligente et son mari est un veritable lettre. Ce sont des gens charmants. Si bien que Mme Verdurin, sentant que, par ce seul infidele, elle serait empechee de realiser l'unite morale du petit noyau, ne put pas s'empecher dans sa rage contre cet obstine qui ne voyait pas combien ses paroles la faisaient souffrir, de lui crier du fond du cur: --Trouvez-le si vous voulez, mais du moins ne nous le dites pas. --Tout depend de ce que vous appelez intelligence, dit Forcheville qui voulait briller a son tour. Voyons, Swann, qu'entendez-vous par intelligence? --Voila! s'ecria Odette, voila les grandes choses dont je lui demande de me parler, mais il ne veut jamais. --Mais si... protesta Swann. --Cette blague! dit Odette. --Blague a tabac? demanda le docteur. --Pour vous, reprit Forcheville, l'intelligence, est-ce le bagout du monde, les personnes qui savent s'insinuer? --Finissez votre entremets qu'on puisse enlever votre assiette, dit Mme Verdurin d'un ton aigre en s'adressant a Saniette, lequel absorbe dans des reflexions, avait cesse de manger. Et peut-etre un peu honteuse du ton qu'elle avait pris: Cela ne fait rien, vous avez votre temps, mais, si je vous le dis, c'est pour les autres, parce que cela empeche de servir. --Il y a, dit Brichot en martelant les syllabes, une definition bien curieuse de l'intelligence dans ce doux anarchiste de Fenelon... --Ecoutez! dit a Forcheville et au docteur Mme Verdurin, il va nous dire la definition de l'intelligence par Fenelon, c'est interessant, on n'a pas toujours l'occasion d'apprendre cela. Mais Brichot attendait que Swann eut donne la sienne. Celui-ci ne repondit pas et en se derobant fit manquer la brillante joute que Mme Verdurin se rejouissait d'offrir a Forcheville. --Naturellement, c'est comme avec moi, dit Odette d'un ton boudeur, je ne suis pas fachee de voir que je ne suis pas la seule qu'il ne trouve pas a la hauteur. --Ces de La Tremouaille que Mme Verdurin nous a montres comme si peu recommandables, demanda Brichot, en articulant avec force, descendent-ils de ceux que cette bonne snob de Mme de Sevigne avouait etre heureuse de connaitre parce que cela faisait bien pour ses paysans? Il est vrai que la marquise avait une autre raison, et qui pour elle devait primer celle-la, car gendelettre dans l'ame, elle faisait passer la copie avant tout. Or dans le journal qu'elle envoyait regulierement a sa fille, c'est Mme de la Tremouaille, bien documentee par ses grandes alliances, qui faisait la politique etrangere. --Mais non, je ne crois pas que ce soit la meme famille, dit a tout hasard Mme Verdurin. Saniette qui, depuis qu'il avait rendu precipitamment au maitre d'hotel son assiette encore pleine, s'etait replonge dans un silence meditatif, en sortit enfin pour raconter en riant l'histoire d'un diner qu'il avait fait avec le duc de La Tremoille et d'ou il resultait que celui-ci ne savait pas que George Sand etait le pseudonyme d'une femme. Swann qui avait de la sympathie pour Saniette crut devoir lui donner sur la culture du duc des details montrant qu'une telle ignorance de la part de celui-ci etait materiellement impossible; mais tout d'un coup il s'arreta, il venait de comprendre que Saniette n'avait pas besoin de ces preuves et savait que l'histoire etait fausse pour la",3.512890248232527,1.852573697711913,0.30167593961116246,0.12515936719022927,4.565217391304348,4.0,2.5412640371880317,20.85333333333333,17.0,21.06351875215113,1.3459079283887467,1.0,0.6970268476216874,1564,620,0.39641943734015345,8266,75,25.128632970693108,81889201614.43802,42407665.25864217,0.6010612210359525,0.6142308281045662,71.8050559249787,8.424513554987211,10.53366545652748,11.563839727195225,10.498840579710144,9.624040920716109,42.976095481670924,4.613333333333333,True,55.0,0.8741584671154842,4.2806835836354225,1931.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01450735442272819,0.0028208744710860366,0.0,0.15018125323666495,60,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"depouillee des formules de convention telles que: Ce n'est pas du mal que nous disons et auxquelles il dedaignait de s'abaisser, paraissait une perfidie. Il y a des auteurs originaux dont la moindre hardiesse revolte parce qu'ils n'ont pas d'abord flatte les gouts du public et ne lui ont pas servi les lieux communs auxquels il est habitue; c'est de la meme maniere que Swann indignait M. Verdurin. Pour Swann comme pour eux, c'etait la nouveaute de son langage qui faisait croire a la noirceur de ses intentions. Swann ignorait encore la disgrace dont il etait menace chez les Verdurin et continuait a voir leurs ridicules en beau, au travers de son amour. Il n'avait de rendez-vous avec Odette, au moins le plus souvent, que le soir; mais le jour, ayant peur de la fatiguer de lui en allant chez elle, il aurait aime du moins ne pas cesser d'occuper sa pensee, et a tous moments il cherchait a trouver une occasion d'y intervenir, mais d'une facon agreable pour elle. Si, a la devanture d'un fleuriste ou d'un joaillier, la vue d'un arbuste ou d'un bijou le charmait, aussitot il pensait a les envoyer a Odette, imaginant le plaisir qu'ils lui avaient procure, ressenti par elle, venant accroitre la tendresse qu'elle avait pour lui, et les faisait porter immediatement rue La Perouse, pour ne pas retarder l'instant ou, comme elle recevrait quelque chose de lui, il se sentirait en quelque sorte pres d'elle. Il voulait surtout qu'elle les recut avant de sortir pour que la reconnaissance qu'elle eprouverait lui valut un accueil plus tendre quand elle le verrait chez les Verdurin, ou meme, qui sait, si le fournisseur faisait assez diligence, peut-etre une lettre qu'elle lui enverrait avant le diner, ou sa venue a elle en personne chez lui, en une visite supplementaire, pour le remercier. Comme jadis quand il experimentait sur la nature d'Odette les reactions du depit, il cherchait par celles de la gratitude a tirer d'elle des parcelles intimes de sentiment qu'elle ne lui avait pas revelees encore. Souvent elle avait des embarras d'argent et, pressee par une dette, le priait de lui venir en aide. Il en etait heureux comme de tout ce qui pouvait donner a Odette une grande idee de l'amour qu'il avait pour elle, ou simplement une grande idee de son influence, de l'utilite dont il pouvait lui etre. Sans doute si on lui avait dit au debut: c'est ta situation qui lui plait, et maintenant: c'est pour ta fortune qu'elle t'aime, il ne l'aurait pas cru, et n'aurait pas ete d'ailleurs tres mecontent qu'on se la figurat tenant a lui,--qu'on les sentit unis l'un a l'autre--par quelque chose d'aussi fort que le snobisme ou l'argent. Mais, meme s'il avait pense que c'etait vrai, peut-etre n'eut-il pas souffert de decouvrir a l'amour d'Odette pour lui cet etat plus durable que l'agrement ou les qualites qu'elle pouvait lui trouver: l'interet, l'interet qui empecherait de venir jamais le jour ou elle aurait pu etre tentee de cesser de le voir. Pour l'instant, en la comblant de presents, en lui rendant des services, il pouvait se reposer sur des avantages exterieurs a sa personne, a son intelligence, du soin epuisant de lui plaire par lui-meme. Et cette volupte d'etre amoureux, de ne vivre que d'amour, de la realite de laquelle il doutait parfois, le prix dont en somme il la payait, en dilettante de sensations immaterielles, lui en augmentait la valeur,--comme on voit des gens incertains si le spectacle de la mer et le bruit de ses vagues sont delicieux, s'en convaincre ainsi que de la rare qualite de leurs gouts desinteresses, en louant cent francs par jour la chambre d'hotel qui leur permet de les gouter. Un jour que des reflexions de ce genre le ramenaient encore au souvenir du temps ou on lui avait parle d'Odette comme d'une femme entretenue, et ou une fois de plus il s'amusait a opposer cette personnification etrange: la femme entretenue,--chatoyant amalgame d'elements inconnus et diaboliques, serti, comme une apparition de Gustave Moreau, de fleurs veneneuses entrelacees a des joyaux precieux,--et cette Odette sur le visage de qui il avait vu passer les memes sentiments de pitie pour un malheureux, de revolte contre une injustice, de gratitude pour un bienfait, qu'il avait vu eprouver autrefois par sa propre mere, par ses amis, cette Odette dont les propos avaient si souvent trait aux choses qu'il connaissait le mieux lui-meme, a ses collections, a sa chambre, a son vieux domestique, au banquier chez qui il avait ses titres, il se trouva que cette derniere image du banquier lui rappela qu'il aurait a y prendre de l'argent. En effet, si ce mois-ci il venait moins largement a l'aide d'Odette dans ses difficultes materielles qu'il n'avait fait le mois dernier ou il lui avait donne cinq mille francs, et s'il ne lui offrait pas une riviere de diamants qu'elle desirait, il ne renouvellerait pas en elle cette admiration qu'elle avait pour sa generosite, cette reconnaissance, qui le rendaient si heureux, et meme il risquerait de lui faire croire que son amour pour elle, comme elle en verrait les manifestations devenir moins grandes, avait diminue. Alors, tout d'un coup, il se demanda si cela, ce n'etait pas precisement l'entretenir (comme si, en effet, cette notion d'entretenir pouvait etre extraite d'elements non pas mysterieux ni pervers, mais appartenant au fond quotidien et prive de sa vie, tels que ce billet de mille francs, domestique et familier, dechire et recolle, que son valet de chambre, apres lui avoir paye les comptes du mois et le terme, avait serre dans le tiroir du vieux bureau ou Swann l'avait repris pour l'envoyer avec quatre autres a Odette) et si on ne pouvait pas appliquer a Odette, depuis qu'il la connaissait (car il ne soupconna pas un instant qu'elle eut jamais pu recevoir d'argent de personne avant lui), ce mot qu'il avait cru si inconciliable avec elle, de femme entretenue. Il ne put approfondir cette idee, car un acces d'une paresse d'esprit, qui etait chez lui congenitale, intermittente et providentielle, vint a ce moment eteindre toute lumiere dans son intelligence, aussi brusquement que, plus tard, quand on eut installe partout l'eclairage electrique, on put couper l'electricite dans une maison. Sa pensee tatonna un instant dans l'obscurite, il retira ses lunettes, en essuya les verres, se passa la main sur les yeux, et ne revit la lumiere que quand il se retrouva en presence d'une idee toute differente, a savoir qu'il faudrait tacher d'envoyer le mois prochain six ou sept mille francs a Odette au lieu de cinq, a cause de la surprise et de la joie que cela lui causerait. Le soir, quand il ne restait pas chez lui a attendre l'heure de retrouver Odette chez les Verdurin ou plutot dans un des restaurants d'ete qu'ils affectionnaient au Bois et surtout a Saint-Cloud, il allait diner dans quelqu'une de ces maisons elegantes dont il etait jadis le convive habituel. Il ne voulait pas perdre contact avec des gens qui--savait-on? pourraient peut-etre un jour etre utiles a Odette, et grace auxquels en attendant il reussissait souvent a lui etre agreable. Puis l'habitude qu'il avait eue longtemps du monde, du luxe, lui en avait donne, en meme temps que le dedain, le besoin, de sorte qu'a partir du moment ou les reduits les plus modestes lui etaient apparus exactement sur le meme pied que les plus princieres demeures, ses sens etaient tellement accoutumes aux secondes qu'il eut eprouve quelque malaise a se trouver dans les premiers. Il avait la meme consideration--a un degre d'identite qu'ils n'auraient pu croire--pour des petits bourgeois qui faisaient danser au cinquieme etage d'un escalier D, palier a gauche, que pour la princesse de Parme qui donnait les plus belles fetes de Paris; mais il n'avait pas la sensation d'etre au bal en se tenant avec les peres dans la chambre a coucher de la maitresse de la maison et la vue des lavabos recouverts de serviettes, des lits transformes en vestiaires, sur le couvre-pied desquels s'entassaient les pardessus et les chapeaux lui donnait la meme sensation d'etouffement que peut causer aujourd'hui a des gens habitues a vingt ans d'electricite l'odeur d'une lampe qui charbonne ou d'une veilleuse qui file. Le jour ou il dinait en ville, il faisait atteler pour sept heures et demie; il s'habillait tout en songeant a Odette et ainsi il ne se trouvait pas seul, car la pensee constante d'Odette donnait aux moments ou il etait loin d'elle le meme charme particulier qu'a ceux ou elle etait la. Il montait en voiture, mais il sentait que cette pensee y avait saute en meme temps et s'installait sur ses genoux comme une bete aimee qu'on emmene partout et qu'il garderait avec lui a table, a l'insu des convives. Il la caressait, se rechauffait a elle, et eprouvant une sorte de langueur, se laissait aller a un leger fremissement qui crispait son cou et son nez, et etait nouveau chez lui, tout en fixant a sa boutonniere le bouquet d'ancolies. Se sentant souffrant et triste depuis quelque temps, surtout depuis qu'Odette avait presente Forcheville aux Verdurin, Swann aurait aime aller se reposer un peu a la campagne. Mais il n'aurait pas eu le courage de quitter Paris un seul jour pendant qu'Odette y etait. L'air etait chaud; c'etaient les plus beaux jours du printemps. Et il avait beau traverser une ville de pierre pour se rendre en quelque hotel clos, ce qui etait sans cesse devant ses yeux, c'etait un parc qu'il possedait pres de Combray, ou, des quatre heures, avant d'arriver au plant d'asperges, grace au vent qui vient des champs de Meseglise, on pouvait gouter sous une charmille autant de fraicheur qu'au bord de l'etang cerne de myosotis et de glaieuls, et ou, quand il dinait, enlacees par son jardinier, couraient autour de la table les groseilles et les roses. Apres diner, si le rendez-vous au bois ou a Saint-Cloud etait de bonne",4.9730776617702155,1.7631844831234444,0.33185363155090947,0.06815660315626705,4.521571152607856,4.0,2.689983730491238,41.972972972972975,34.0,32.68728696296573,1.3200257566001288,1.0,0.6837019035821379,1553,613,0.3947198969735995,8162,37,23.983310849593074,26050709727.51986,13842034.92429323,0.852198600769043,0.8533025435038976,52.55825342406155,16.355763387340982,13.023866798666859,19.648171803484104,20.85308661526949,10.081622665808112,64.18804058404831,9.324324324324325,True,64.0,0.8947927736450585,4.336875664187035,1882.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004886988393402566,0.0021380574221136223,0.0,0.14452709883103082,62,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"heure, il partait si vite en sortant de table,--surtout si la pluie menacait de tomber et de faire rentrer plus tot les fideles,--qu'une fois la princesse des Laumes (chez qui on avait dine tard et que Swann avait quittee avant qu'on servit le cafe pour rejoindre les Verdurin dans l'ile du Bois) dit: --Vraiment, si Swann avait trente ans de plus et une maladie de la vessie, on l'excuserait de filer ainsi. Mais tout de meme il se moque du monde. Il se disait que le charme du printemps qu'il ne pouvait pas aller gouter a Combray, il le trouverait du moins dans l'ile des Cygnes ou a Saint-Cloud. Mais comme il ne pouvait penser qu'a Odette, il ne savait meme pas, s'il avait senti l'odeur des feuilles, s'il y avait eu du clair de lune. Il etait accueilli par la petite phrase de la Sonate jouee dans le jardin sur le piano du restaurant. S'il n'y en avait pas la, les Verdurin prenaient une grande peine pour en faire descendre un d'une chambre ou d'une salle a manger: ce n'est pas que Swann fut rentre en faveur aupres d'eux, au contraire. Mais l'idee d'organiser un plaisir ingenieux pour quelqu'un, meme pour quelqu'un qu'ils n'aimaient pas, developpait chez eux, pendant les moments necessaires a ces preparatifs, des sentiments ephemeres et occasionnels de sympathie et de cordialite. Parfois il se disait que c'etait un nouveau soir de printemps de plus qui passait, il se contraignait a faire attention aux arbres, au ciel. Mais l'agitation ou le mettait la presence d'Odette, et aussi un leger malaise febrile qui ne le quittait guere depuis quelque temps, le privait du calme et du bien-etre qui sont le fond indispensable aux impressions que peut donner la nature. Un soir ou Swann avait accepte de diner avec les Verdurin, comme pendant le diner il venait de dire que le lendemain il avait un banquet d'anciens camarades, Odette lui avait repondu en pleine table, devant Forcheville, qui etait maintenant un des fideles, devant le peintre, devant Cottard: --Oui, je sais que vous avez votre banquet, je ne vous verrai donc que chez moi, mais ne venez pas trop tard. Bien que Swann n'eut encore jamais pris bien serieusement ombrage de l'amitie d'Odette pour tel ou tel fidele, il eprouvait une douceur profonde a l'entendre avouer ainsi devant tous, avec cette tranquille impudeur, leurs rendez-vous quotidiens du soir, la situation privilegiee qu'il avait chez elle et la preference pour lui qui y etait impliquee. Certes Swann avait souvent pense qu'Odette n'etait a aucun degre une femme remarquable; et la suprematie qu'il exercait sur un etre qui lui etait si inferieur n'avait rien qui dut lui paraitre si flatteur a voir proclamer a la face des fideles, mais depuis qu'il s'etait apercu qu'a beaucoup d'hommes Odette semblait une femme ravissante et desirable, le charme qu'avait pour eux son corps avait eveille en lui un besoin douloureux de la maitriser entierement dans les moindres parties de son cur. Et il avait commence d'attacher un prix inestimable a ces moments passes chez elle le soir, ou il l'asseyait sur ses genoux, lui faisait dire ce qu'elle pensait d'une chose, d'une autre, ou il recensait les seuls biens a la possession desquels il tint maintenant sur terre. Aussi, apres ce diner, la prenant a part, il ne manqua pas de la remercier avec effusion, cherchant a lui enseigner selon les degres de la reconnaissance qu'il lui temoignait, l'echelle des plaisirs qu'elle pouvait lui causer, et dont le supreme etait de le garantir, pendant le temps que son amour durerait et l'y rendrait vulnerable, des atteintes de la jalousie. Quand il sortit le lendemain du banquet, il pleuvait a verse, il n'avait a sa disposition que sa victoria; un ami lui proposa de le reconduire chez lui en coupe, et comme Odette, par le fait qu'elle lui avait demande de venir, lui avait donne la certitude qu'elle n'attendait personne, c'est l'esprit tranquille et le cur content que, plutot que de partir ainsi dans la pluie, il serait rentre chez lui se coucher. Mais peut-etre, si elle voyait qu'il n'avait pas l'air de tenir a passer toujours avec elle, sans aucune exception, la fin de la soiree, negligerait-elle de la lui reserver, justement une fois ou il l'aurait particulierement desire. Il arriva chez elle apres onze heures, et, comme il s'excusait de n'avoir pu venir plus tot, elle se plaignit que ce fut en effet bien tard, l'orage l'avait rendue souffrante, elle se sentait mal a la tete et le prevint qu'elle ne le garderait pas plus d'une demi-heure, qu'a minuit, elle le renverrait; et, peu apres, elle se sentit fatiguee et desira s'endormir. --Alors, pas de catleyas ce soir? lui dit-il, moi qui esperais un bon petit catleya. Et d'un air un peu boudeur et nerveux, elle lui repondit: --Mais non, mon petit, pas de catleyas ce soir, tu vois bien que je suis souffrante! --Cela t'aurait peut-etre fait du bien, mais enfin je n'insiste pas. Elle le pria d'eteindre la lumiere avant de s'en aller, il referma lui-meme les rideaux du lit et partit. Mais quand il fut rentre chez lui, l'idee lui vint brusquement que peut-etre Odette attendait quelqu'un ce soir, qu'elle avait seulement simule la fatigue et qu'elle ne lui avait demande d'eteindre que pour qu'il crut qu'elle allait s'endormir, qu'aussitot qu'il avait ete parti, elle l'avait rallumee, et fait rentrer celui qui devait passer la nuit aupres d'elle. Il regarda l'heure. Il y avait a peu pres une heure et demie qu'il l'avait quittee, il ressortit, prit un fiacre et se fit arreter tout pres de chez elle, dans une petite rue perpendiculaire a celle sur laquelle donnait derriere son hotel et ou il allait quelquefois frapper a la fenetre de sa chambre a coucher pour qu'elle vint lui ouvrir; il descendit de voiture, tout etait desert et noir dans ce quartier, il n'eut que quelques pas a faire a pied et deboucha presque devant chez elle. Parmi l'obscurite de toutes les fenetres eteintes depuis longtemps dans la rue, il en vit une seule d'ou debordait,--entre les volets qui en pressaient la pulpe mysterieuse et doree,--la lumiere qui remplissait la chambre et qui, tant d'autres soirs, du plus loin qu'il l'apercevait, en arrivant dans la rue le rejouissait et lui annoncait: elle est la qui t'attend et qui maintenant, le torturait en lui disant: elle est la avec celui qu'elle attendait. Il voulait savoir qui; il se glissa le long du mur jusqu'a la fenetre, mais entre les lames obliques des volets il ne pouvait rien voir; il entendait seulement dans le silence de la nuit le murmure d'une conversation. Certes, il souffrait de voir cette lumiere dans l'atmosphere d'or de laquelle se mouvait derriere le chassis le couple invisible et deteste, d'entendre ce murmure qui revelait la presence de celui qui etait venu apres son depart, la faussete d'Odette, le bonheur qu'elle etait en train de gouter avec lui. Et pourtant il etait content d'etre venu: le tourment qui l'avait force de sortir de chez lui avait perdu de son acuite en perdant de son vague, maintenant que l'autre vie d'Odette, dont il avait eu, a ce moment-la, le brusque et impuissant soupcon, il la tenait la, eclairee en plein par la lampe, prisonniere sans le savoir dans cette chambre ou, quand il le voudrait, il entrerait la surprendre et la capturer; ou plutot il allait frapper aux volets comme il faisait souvent quand il venait tres tard; ainsi du moins, Odette apprendrait qu'il avait su, qu'il avait vu la lumiere et entendu la causerie, et lui, qui, tout a l'heure, se la representait comme se riant avec l'autre de ses illusions, maintenant, c'etait eux qu'il voyait, confiants dans leur erreur, trompes en somme par lui qu'ils croyaient bien loin d'ici et qui, lui, savait deja qu'il allait frapper aux volets. Et peut-etre, ce qu'il ressentait en ce moment de presque agreable, c'etait autre chose aussi que l'apaisement d'un doute et d'une douleur: un plaisir de l'intelligence. Si, depuis qu'il etait amoureux, les choses avaient repris pour lui un peu de l'interet delicieux qu'il leur trouvait autrefois, mais seulement la ou elles etaient eclairees par le souvenir d'Odette, maintenant, c'etait une autre faculte de sa studieuse jeunesse que sa jalousie ranimait, la passion de la verite, mais d'une verite, elle aussi, interposee entre lui et sa maitresse, ne recevant sa lumiere que d'elle, verite tout individuelle qui avait pour objet unique, d'un prix infini et presque d'une beaute desinteressee, les actions d'Odette, ses relations, ses projets, son passe. A toute autre epoque de sa vie, les petits faits et gestes quotidiens d'une personne avaient toujours paru sans valeur a Swann: si on lui en faisait le commerage, il le trouvait insignifiant, et, tandis qu'il l'ecoutait, ce n'etait que sa plus vulgaire attention qui y etait interessee; c'etait pour lui un des moments ou il se sentait le plus mediocre. Mais dans cette etrange periode de l'amour, l'individuel prend quelque chose de si profond, que cette curiosite qu'il sentait s'eveiller en lui a l'egard des moindres occupations d'une femme, c'etait celle qu'il avait eue autrefois pour l'Histoire. Et tout ce dont il aurait eu honte jusqu'ici, espionner devant une fenetre, qui sait, demain, peut-etre faire parler habilement les indifferents, soudoyer les domestiques, ecouter aux portes, ne lui semblait plus, aussi bien que le dechiffrement des textes, la comparaison des temoignages et l'interpretation des monuments, que des methodes d'investigation scientifique d'une veritable valeur intellectuelle et appropriees a la recherche de la verite. Sur le point de frapper contre les volets, il eut un moment de honte en pensant qu'Odette allait savoir qu'il avait eu des soupcons, qu'il etait revenu, qu'il s'etait poste dans la rue. Elle lui avait dit souvent l'horreur qu'elle avait des jaloux, des amants qui espionnent. Ce qu'il allait faire etait bien maladroit, et elle allait le detester desormais, tandis qu'en ce moment encore, tant qu'il n'avait pas",4.400597824731936,1.5894419350760791,0.33304080729682084,0.06053947043875394,4.557387862796833,4.0,2.598457942330122,39.89473684210526,28.0,33.244540092823954,1.3278364116094987,1.0,0.6638345588501693,1516,576,0.37994722955145116,8269,38,25.311303668012144,98301356933.97523,51628863.935911365,0.8529467373280912,0.8540699995226331,54.00688168309958,15.63741702541314,12.488612386084178,18.64918761283155,19.98266525482571,10.255488126649073,61.79447298986251,8.736842105263158,True,36.0,0.8807773109243697,4.34296218487395,1904.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005035753852351697,0.005035753852351697,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007251485547386444,0.004532178467116527,0.0,0.14548319327731093,63,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"parlait; il ne l'interrompait pas, il recueillait avec une piete avide et douloureuse ces mots qu'elle lui disait et qu'il sentait (justement, parce qu'elle la cachait derriere eux tout en lui parlant) garder vaguement, comme le voile sacre, l'empreinte, dessiner l'incertain modele, de cette realite infiniment precieuse et helas introuvable:--ce qu'elle faisait tantot a trois heures, quand il etait venu,--de laquelle il ne possederait jamais que ces mensonges, illisibles et divins vestiges, et qui n'existait plus que dans le souvenir receleur de cet etre qui la contemplait sans savoir l'apprecier, mais ne la lui livrerait pas. Certes il se doutait bien par moments qu'en elles-memes les actions quotidiennes d'Odette n'etaient pas passionnement interessantes, et que les relations qu'elle pouvait avoir avec d'autres hommes n'exhalaient pas naturellement d'une facon universelle et pour tout etre pensant, une tristesse morbide, capable de donner la fievre du suicide. Il se rendait compte alors que cet interet, cette tristesse n'existaient qu'en lui comme une maladie, et que quand celle-ci serait guerie, les actes d'Odette, les baisers qu'elle aurait pu donner redeviendraient inoffensifs comme ceux de tant d'autres femmes. Mais que la curiosite douloureuse que Swann y portait maintenant n'eut sa cause qu'en lui, n'etait pas pour lui faire trouver deraisonnable de considerer cette curiosite comme importante et de mettre tout en uvre pour lui donner satisfaction. C'est que Swann arrivait a un age dont la philosophie--favorisee par celle de l'epoque, par celle aussi du milieu ou Swann avait beaucoup vecu, de cette coterie de la princesse des Laumes ou il etait convenu qu'on est intelligent dans la mesure ou on doute de tout et ou on ne trouvait de reel et d'incontestable que les gouts de chacun--n'est deja plus celle de la jeunesse, mais une philosophie positive, presque medicale, d'hommes qui au lieu d'exterioriser les objets de leurs aspirations, essayent de degager de leurs annees deja ecoulees un residu fixe d'habitudes, de passions qu'ils puissent considerer en eux comme caracteristiques et permanentes et auxquelles, deliberement, ils veilleront d'abord que le genre d'existence qu'ils adoptent puisse donner satisfaction. Swann trouvait sage de faire dans sa vie la part de la souffrance qu'il eprouvait a ignorer ce qu'avait fait Odette, aussi bien que la part de la recrudescence qu'un climat humide causait a son eczema; de prevoir dans son budget une disponibilite importante pour obtenir sur l'emploi des journees d'Odette des renseignements sans lesquels il se sentirait malheureux, aussi bien qu'il en reservait pour d'autres gouts dont il savait qu'il pouvait attendre du plaisir, au moins avant qu'il fut amoureux, comme celui des collections et de la bonne cuisine. Quand il voulut dire adieu a Odette pour rentrer, elle lui demanda de rester encore et le retint meme vivement, en lui prenant le bras, au moment ou il allait ouvrir la porte pour sortir. Mais il n'y prit pas garde, car, dans la multitude des gestes, des propos, des petits incidents qui remplissent une conversation, il est inevitable que nous passions, sans y rien remarquer qui eveille notre attention, pres de ceux qui cachent une verite que nos soupcons cherchent au hasard, et que nous nous arretions au contraire a ceux sous lesquels il n'y a rien. Elle lui redisait tout le temps: Quel malheur que toi, qui ne viens jamais l'apres-midi, pour une fois que cela t'arrive, je ne t'aie pas vu. Il savait bien qu'elle n'etait pas assez amoureuse de lui pour avoir un regret si vif d'avoir manque sa visite, mais comme elle etait bonne, desireuse de lui faire plaisir, et souvent triste quand elle l'avait contrarie, il trouva tout naturel qu'elle le fut cette fois de l'avoir prive de ce plaisir de passer une heure ensemble qui etait tres grand, non pour elle, mais pour lui. C'etait pourtant une chose assez peu importante pour que l'air douloureux qu'elle continuait d'avoir finit par l'etonner. Elle rappelait ainsi plus encore qu'il ne le trouvait d'habitude, les figures de femmes du peintre de la Primavera. Elle avait en ce moment leur visage abattu et navre qui semble succomber sous le poids d'une douleur trop lourde pour elles, simplement quand elles laissent l'enfant Jesus jouer avec une grenade ou regardent Moise verser de l'eau dans une auge. Il lui avait deja vu une fois une telle tristesse, mais ne savait plus quand. Et tout d'un coup, il se rappela: c'etait quand Odette avait menti en parlant a Mme Verdurin le lendemain de ce diner ou elle n'etait pas venue sous pretexte qu'elle etait malade et en realite pour rester avec Swann. Certes, eut-elle ete la plus scrupuleuse des femmes qu'elle n'aurait pu avoir de remords d'un mensonge aussi innocent. Mais ceux que faisait couramment Odette l'etaient moins et servaient a empecher des decouvertes qui auraient pu lui creer avec les uns ou avec les autres, de terribles difficultes. Aussi quand elle mentait, prise de peur, se sentant peu armee pour se defendre, incertaine du succes, elle avait envie de pleurer, par fatigue, comme certains enfants qui n'ont pas dormi. Puis elle savait que son mensonge lesait d'ordinaire gravement l'homme a qui elle le faisait, et a la merci duquel elle allait peut-etre tomber si elle mentait mal. Alors elle se sentait a la fois humble et coupable devant lui. Et quand elle avait a faire un mensonge insignifiant et mondain, par association de sensations et de souvenirs, elle eprouvait le malaise d'un surmenage et le regret d'une mechancete. Quel mensonge deprimant etait-elle en train de faire a Swann pour qu'elle eut ce regard douloureux, cette voix plaintive qui semblaient flechir sous l'effort qu'elle s'imposait, et demander grace? Il eut l'idee que ce n'etait pas seulement la verite sur l'incident de l'apres-midi qu'elle s'efforcait de lui cacher, mais quelque chose de plus actuel, peut-etre de non encore survenu et de tout prochain, et qui pourrait l'eclairer sur cette verite. A ce moment, il entendit un coup de sonnette. Odette ne cessa plus de parler, mais ses paroles n'etaient qu'un gemissement: son regret de ne pas avoir vu Swann dans l'apres-midi, de ne pas lui avoir ouvert, etait devenu un veritable desespoir. On entendit la porte d'entree se refermer et le bruit d'une voiture, comme si repartait une personne--celle probablement que Swann ne devait pas rencontrer--a qui on avait dit qu'Odette etait sortie. Alors en songeant que rien qu'en venant a une heure ou il n'en avait pas l'habitude, il s'etait trouve deranger tant de choses qu'elle ne voulait pas qu'il sut, il eprouva un sentiment de decouragement, presque de detresse. Mais comme il aimait Odette, comme il avait l'habitude de tourner vers elle toutes ses pensees, la pitie qu'il eut pu s'inspirer a lui-meme ce fut pour elle qu'il la ressentit, et il murmura: Pauvre cherie! Quand il la quitta, elle prit plusieurs lettres qu'elle avait sur sa table et lui demanda s'il ne pourrait pas les mettre a la poste. Il les emporta et, une fois rentre, s'apercut qu'il avait garde les lettres sur lui. Il retourna jusqu'a la poste, les tira de sa poche et avant de les jeter dans la boite regarda les adresses. Elles etaient toutes pour des fournisseurs, sauf une pour Forcheville. Il la tenait dans sa main. Il se disait: Si je voyais ce qu'il y a dedans, je saurais comment elle l'appelle, comment elle lui parle, s'il y a quelque chose entre eux. Peut-etre meme qu'en ne la regardant pas, je commets une indelicatesse a l'egard d'Odette, car c'est la seule maniere de me delivrer d'un soupcon peut-etre calomnieux pour elle, destine en tous cas a la faire souffrir et que rien ne pourrait plus detruire, une fois la lettre partie. Il rentra chez lui en quittant la poste, mais il avait garde sur lui cette derniere lettre. Il alluma une bougie et en approcha l'enveloppe qu'il n'avait pas ose ouvrir. D'abord il ne put rien lire, mais l'enveloppe etait mince, et en la faisant adherer a la carte dure qui y etait incluse, il put a travers sa transparence, lire les derniers mots. C'etait une formule finale tres froide. Si, au lieu que ce fut lui qui regardat une lettre adressee a Forcheville, c'eut ete Forcheville qui eut lu une lettre adressee a Swann, il aurait pu voir des mots autrement tendres! Il maintint immobile la carte qui dansait dans l'enveloppe plus grande qu'elle, puis, la faisant glisser avec le pouce, en amena successivement les differentes lignes sous la partie de l'enveloppe qui n'etait pas doublee, la seule a travers laquelle on pouvait lire. Malgre cela il ne distinguait pas bien. D'ailleurs cela ne faisait rien car il en avait assez vu pour se rendre compte qu'il s'agissait d'un petit evenement sans importance et qui ne touchait nullement a des relations amoureuses, c'etait quelque chose qui se rapportait a un oncle d'Odette. Swann avait bien lu au commencement de la ligne: J'ai eu raison, mais ne comprenait pas ce qu'Odette avait eu raison de faire, quand soudain, un mot qu'il n'avait pas pu dechiffrer d'abord, apparut et eclaira le sens de la phrase tout entiere: J'ai eu raison d'ouvrir, c'etait mon oncle. D'ouvrir! alors Forcheville etait la tantot quand Swann avait sonne et elle l'avait fait partir, d'ou le bruit qu'il avait entendu. Alors il lut toute la lettre; a la fin elle s'excusait d'avoir agi aussi sans facon avec lui et lui disait qu'il avait oublie ses cigarettes chez elle, la meme phrase qu'elle avait ecrite a Swann une des premieres fois qu'il etait venu. Mais pour Swann elle avait ajoute: puissiez-vous y avoir laisse votre cur, je ne vous aurais pas laisse le reprendre. Pour Forcheville rien de tel: aucune allusion qui put faire supposer une intrigue entre eux. A vrai dire d'ailleurs, Forcheville etait en tout ceci plus trompe que lui puisque Odette lui ecrivait pour lui faire croire que le visiteur etait son oncle. En somme, c'etait lui, Swann, l'homme a qui elle attachait de l'importance et pour qui elle avait congedie l'autre.

"frappe, peut-etre, meme en le trompant, l'aimait-elle. Que de bonheurs possibles dont on sacrifie ainsi la realisation a l'impatience d'un plaisir immediat. Mais le desir de connaitre la verite etait plus fort et lui sembla plus noble. Il savait que la realite de circonstances qu'il eut donne sa vie pour restituer exactement, etait lisible derriere cette fenetre striee de lumiere, comme sous la couverture enluminee d'or d'un de ces manuscrits precieux a la richesse artistique elle-meme desquels le savant qui les consulte ne peut rester indifferent. Il eprouvait une volupte a connaitre la verite qui le passionnait dans cet exemplaire unique, ephemere et precieux, d'une matiere translucide, si chaude et si belle. Et puis l'avantage qu'il se sentait,--qu'il avait tant besoin de se sentir,--sur eux, etait peut-etre moins de savoir, que de pouvoir leur montrer qu'il savait. Il se haussa sur la pointe des pieds. Il frappa. On n'avait pas entendu, il refrappa plus fort, la conversation s'arreta. Une voix d'homme dont il chercha a distinguer auquel de ceux des amis d'Odette qu'il connaissait elle pouvait appartenir, demanda: --Qui est la? Il n'etait pas sur de la reconnaitre. Il frappa encore une fois. On ouvrit la fenetre, puis les volets. Maintenant, il n'y avait plus moyen de reculer, et, puisqu'elle allait tout savoir, pour ne pas avoir l'air trop malheureux, trop jaloux et curieux, il se contenta de crier d'un air negligent et gai: --Ne vous derangez pas, je passais par la, j'ai vu de la lumiere, j'ai voulu savoir si vous n'etiez plus souffrante. Il regarda. Devant lui, deux vieux messieurs etaient a la fenetre, l'un tenant une lampe, et alors, il vit la chambre, une chambre inconnue. Ayant l'habitude, quand il venait chez Odette tres tard, de reconnaitre sa fenetre a ce que c'etait la seule eclairee entre les fenetres toutes pareilles, il s'etait trompe et avait frappe a la fenetre suivante qui appartenait a la maison voisine. Il s'eloigna en s'excusant et rentra chez lui, heureux que la satisfaction de sa curiosite eut laisse leur amour intact et qu'apres avoir simule depuis si longtemps vis-a-vis d'Odette une sorte d'indifference, il ne lui eut pas donne, par sa jalousie, cette preuve qu'il l'aimait trop, qui, entre deux amants, dispense, a tout jamais, d'aimer assez, celui qui la recoit. Il ne lui parla pas de cette mesaventure, lui-meme n'y songeait plus. Mais, par moments, un mouvement de sa pensee venait en rencontrer le souvenir qu'elle n'avait pas apercu, le heurtait, l'enfoncait plus avant et Swann avait ressenti une douleur brusque et profonde. Comme si c'avait ete une douleur physique, les pensees de Swann ne pouvaient pas l'amoindrir; mais du moins la douleur physique, parce qu'elle est independante de la pensee, la pensee peut s'arreter sur elle, constater qu'elle a diminue, qu'elle a momentanement cesse! Mais cette douleur-la, la pensee, rien qu'en se la rappelant, la recreait. Vouloir n'y pas penser, c'etait y penser encore, en souffrir encore. Et quand, causant avec des amis, il oubliait son mal, tout d'un coup un mot qu'on lui disait le faisait changer de visage, comme un blesse dont un maladroit vient de toucher sans precaution le membre douloureux. Quand il quittait Odette, il etait heureux, il se sentait calme, il se rappelait les sourires qu'elle avait eus, railleurs, en parlant de tel ou tel autre, et tendres pour lui, la lourdeur de sa tete qu'elle avait detachee de son axe pour l'incliner, la laisser tomber, presque malgre elle, sur ses levres, comme elle avait fait la premiere fois en voiture, les regards mourants qu'elle lui avait jetes pendant qu'elle etait dans ses bras, tout en contractant frileusement contre l'epaule sa tete inclinee. Mais aussitot sa jalousie, comme si elle etait l'ombre de son amour, se completait du double de ce nouveau sourire qu'elle lui avait adresse le soir meme--et qui, inverse maintenant, raillait Swann et se chargeait d'amour pour un autre--, de cette inclinaison de sa tete mais renversee vers d'autres levres, et, donnees a un autre, de toutes les marques de tendresse qu'elle avait eues pour lui. Et tous les souvenirs voluptueux qu'il emportait de chez elle, etaient comme autant d'esquisses, de projets pareils a ceux que vous soumet un decorateur, et qui permettaient a Swann de se faire une idee des attitudes ardentes ou pamees qu'elle pouvait avoir avec d'autres. De sorte qu'il en arrivait a regretter chaque plaisir qu'il goutait pres d'elle, chaque caresse inventee et dont il avait eu l'imprudence de lui signaler la douceur, chaque grace qu'il lui decouvrait, car il savait qu'un instant apres, elles allaient enrichir d'instruments nouveaux son supplice. Celui-ci etait rendu plus cruel encore quand revenait a Swann le souvenir d'un bref regard qu'il avait surpris, il y avait quelques jours, et pour la premiere fois, dans les yeux d'Odette. C'etait apres diner, chez les Verdurin. Soit que Forcheville sentant que Saniette, son beau-frere, n'etait pas en faveur chez eux, eut voulu le prendre comme tete de Turc et briller devant eux a ses depens, soit qu'il eut ete irrite par un mot maladroit que celui-ci venait de lui dire et qui, d'ailleurs, passa inapercu pour les assistants qui ne savaient pas quelle allusion desobligeante il pouvait renfermer, bien contre le gre de celui qui le prononcait sans malice aucune, soit enfin qu'il cherchat depuis quelque temps une occasion de faire sortir de la maison quelqu'un qui le connaissait trop bien et qu'il savait trop delicat pour qu'il ne se sentit pas gene a certains moments rien que de sa presence, Forcheville repondit a ce propos maladroit de Saniette avec une telle grossierete, se mettant a l'insulter, s'enhardissant, au fur et a mesure qu'il vociferait, de l'effroi, de la douleur, des supplications de l'autre, que le malheureux, apres avoir demande a Mme Verdurin s'il devait rester, et n'ayant pas recu de reponse, s'etait retire en balbutiant, les larmes aux yeux. Odette avait assiste impassible a cette scene, mais quand la porte se fut refermee sur Saniette, faisant descendre en quelque sorte de plusieurs crans l'expression habituelle de son visage, pour pouvoir se trouver dans la bassesse, de plain-pied avec Forcheville, elle avait brillante ses prunelles d'un sourire sournois de felicitations pour l'audace qu'il avait eue, d'ironie pour celui qui en avait ete victime; elle lui avait jete un regard de complicite dans le mal, qui voulait si bien dire: voila une execution, ou je ne m'y connais pas. Avez-vous vu son air penaud, il en pleurait, que Forcheville, quand ses yeux rencontrerent ce regard, degrise soudain de la colere ou de la simulation de colere dont il etait encore chaud, sourit et repondit: --Il n'avait qu'a etre aimable, il serait encore ici, une bonne correction peut etre utile a tout age. Un jour que Swann etait sorti au milieu de l'apres-midi pour faire une visite, n'ayant pas trouve la personne qu'il voulait rencontrer, il eut l'idee d'entrer chez Odette a cette heure ou il n'allait jamais chez elle, mais ou il savait qu'elle etait toujours a la maison a faire sa sieste ou a ecrire des lettres avant l'heure du the, et ou il aurait plaisir a la voir un peu sans la deranger. Le concierge lui dit qu'il croyait qu'elle etait la; il sonna, crut entendre du bruit, entendre marcher, mais on n'ouvrit pas. Anxieux, irrite, il alla dans la petite rue ou donnait l'autre face de l'hotel, se mit devant la fenetre de la chambre d'Odette; les rideaux l'empechaient de rien voir, il frappa avec force aux carreaux, appela; personne n'ouvrit. Il vit que des voisins le regardaient. Il partit, pensant qu'apres tout, il s'etait peut-etre trompe en croyant entendre des pas; mais il en resta si preoccupe qu'il ne pouvait penser a autre chose. Une heure apres, il revint. Il la trouva; elle lui dit qu'elle etait chez elle tantot quand il avait sonne, mais dormait; la sonnette l'avait eveillee, elle avait devine que c'etait Swann, elle avait couru apres lui, mais il etait deja parti. Elle avait bien entendu frapper aux carreaux. Swann reconnut tout de suite dans ce dire un de ces fragments d'un fait exact que les menteurs pris de court se consolent de faire entrer dans la composition du fait faux qu'ils inventent, croyant y faire sa part et y derober sa ressemblance a la Verite. Certes quand Odette venait de faire quelque chose qu'elle ne voulait pas reveler, elle le cachait bien au fond d'elle-meme. Mais des qu'elle se trouvait en presence de celui a qui elle voulait mentir, un trouble la prenait, toutes ses idees s'effondraient, ses facultes d'invention et de raisonnement etaient paralysees, elle ne trouvait plus dans sa tete que le vide, il fallait pourtant dire quelque chose et elle rencontrait a sa portee precisement la chose qu'elle avait voulu dissimuler et qui etant vraie, etait restee la. Elle en detachait un petit morceau, sans importance par lui-meme, se disant qu'apres tout c'etait mieux ainsi puisque c'etait un detail veritable qui n'offrait pas les memes dangers qu'un detail faux. Ca du moins, c'est vrai, se disait-elle, c'est toujours autant de gagne, il peut s'informer, il reconnaitra que c'est vrai, ce n'est toujours pas ca qui me trahira. Elle se trompait, c'etait cela qui la trahissait, elle ne se rendait pas compte que ce detail vrai avait des angles qui ne pouvaient s'emboiter que dans les details contigus du fait vrai dont elle l'avait arbitrairement detache et qui, quels que fussent les details inventes entre lesquels elle le placerait, reveleraient toujours par la matiere excedante et les vides non remplis, que ce n'etait pas d'entre ceux-la qu'il venait. Elle avoue qu'elle m'avait entendu sonner, puis frapper, et qu'elle avait cru que c'etait moi, qu'elle avait envie de me voir, se disait Swann. Mais cela ne s'arrange pas avec le fait qu'elle n'ait pas fait ouvrir. Mais il ne lui fit pas remarquer cette contradiction, car il pensait que, livree a elle-meme, Odette produirait peut-etre quelque mensonge qui serait un faible indice de la verite; elle",3.9701601906845942,1.7762687235608088,0.34479492160293224,0.09912411289339496,4.590879478827362,4.0,2.5160167465385177,27.90909090909091,21.0,26.25557791976453,1.2970684039087947,1.0,0.6117933311269902,1535,594,0.38697068403908796,8393,55,29.719541910251312,8072964752631.452,4146360941.259092,0.7777630228687216,0.7688652653739138,68.77528575658872,10.599952620669232,10.355215969177355,13.456795972756886,14.147587799822332,10.133785016286645,50.449807521468756,6.290909090909091,True,51.0,0.8674884437596302,4.3107344632768365,1947.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008355714712026261,0.0035810205908683975,0.0,0.15511042629686697,64,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"avait rien entre Odette et Forcheville, pourquoi n'avoir pas ouvert tout de suite, pourquoi avoir dit: J'ai bien fait d'ouvrir, c'etait mon oncle; si elle ne faisait rien de mal a ce moment-la, comment Forcheville pourrait-il meme s'expliquer qu'elle eut pu ne pas ouvrir? Swann restait la, desole, confus et pourtant heureux, devant cette enveloppe qu'Odette lui avait remise sans crainte, tant etait absolue la confiance qu'elle avait en sa delicatesse, mais a travers le vitrage transparent de laquelle se devoilait a lui, avec le secret d'un incident qu'il n'aurait jamais cru possible de connaitre, un peu de la vie d'Odette, comme dans une etroite section lumineuse pratiquee a meme l'inconnu. Puis sa jalousie s'en rejouissait, comme si cette jalousie eut eu une vitalite independante, egoiste, vorace de tout ce qui la nourrirait, fut-ce aux depens de lui-meme. Maintenant elle avait un aliment et Swann allait pouvoir commencer a s'inquieter chaque jour des visites qu'Odette avait recues vers cinq heures, a chercher a apprendre ou se trouvait Forcheville a cette heure-la. Car la tendresse de Swann continuait a garder le meme caractere que lui avait imprime des le debut a la fois l'ignorance ou il etait de l'emploi des journees d'Odette et la paresse cerebrale qui l'empechait de suppleer a l'ignorance par l'imagination. Il ne fut pas jaloux d'abord de toute la vie d'Odette, mais des seuls moments ou une circonstance, peut-etre mal interpretee, l'avait amene a supposer qu'Odette avait pu le tromper. Sa jalousie, comme une pieuvre qui jette une premiere, puis une seconde, puis une troisieme amarre, s'attacha solidement a ce moment de cinq heures du soir, puis a un autre, puis a un autre encore. Mais Swann ne savait pas inventer ses souffrances. Elles n'etaient que le souvenir, la perpetuation d'une souffrance qui lui etait venue du dehors. Mais la tout lui en apportait. Il voulut eloigner Odette de Forcheville, l'emmener quelques jours dans le Midi. Mais il croyait qu'elle etait desiree par tous les hommes qui se trouvaient dans l'hotel et qu'elle-meme les desirait. Aussi lui qui jadis en voyage recherchait les gens nouveaux, les assemblees nombreuses, on le voyait sauvage, fuyant la societe des hommes comme si elle l'eut cruellement blesse. Et comment n'aurait-il pas ete misanthrope quand dans tout homme il voyait un amant possible pour Odette? Et ainsi sa jalousie plus encore que n'avait fait le gout voluptueux et riant qu'il avait d'abord pour Odette, alterait le caractere de Swann et changeait du tout au tout, aux yeux des autres, l'aspect meme des signes exterieurs par lesquels ce caractere se manifestait. Un mois apres le jour ou il avait lu la lettre adressee par Odette a Forcheville, Swann alla a un diner que les Verdurin donnaient au Bois. Au moment ou on se preparait a partir, il remarqua des conciliabules entre Mme Verdurin et plusieurs des invites et crut comprendre qu'on rappelait au pianiste de venir le lendemain a une partie a Chatou; or, lui, Swann, n'y etait pas invite. Les Verdurin n'avaient parle qu'a demi-voix et en termes vagues, mais le peintre, distrait sans doute, s'ecria: --Il ne faudra aucune lumiere et qu'il joue la sonate Clair de lune dans l'obscurite pour mieux voir s'eclairer les choses. Mme Verdurin, voyant que Swann etait a deux pas, prit cette expression ou le desir de faire taire celui qui parle et de garder un air innocent aux yeux de celui qui entend, se neutralise en une nullite intense du regard, ou l'immobile signe d'intelligence du complice se dissimule sous les sourires de l'ingenu et qui enfin, commune a tous ceux qui s'apercoivent d'une gaffe, la revele instantanement sinon a ceux qui la font, du moins a celui qui en est l'objet. Odette eut soudain l'air d'une desesperee qui renonce a lutter contre les difficultes ecrasantes de la vie, et Swann comptait anxieusement les minutes qui le separaient du moment ou, apres avoir quitte ce restaurant, pendant le retour avec elle, il allait pouvoir lui demander des explications, obtenir qu'elle n'allat pas le lendemain a Chatou ou qu'elle l'y fit inviter et apaiser dans ses bras l'angoisse qu'il ressentait. Enfin on demanda leurs voitures. Mme Verdurin dit a Swann: --Alors, adieu, a bientot, n'est-ce pas? tachant par l'amabilite du regard et la contrainte du sourire de l'empecher de penser qu'elle ne lui disait pas, comme elle eut toujours fait jusqu'ici: A demain a Chatou, a apres-demain chez moi. M. et Mme Verdurin firent monter avec eux Forcheville, la voiture de Swann s'etait rangee derriere la leur dont il attendait le depart pour faire monter Odette dans la sienne. --Odette, nous vous ramenons, dit Mme Verdurin, nous avons une petite place pour vous a cote de M. de Forcheville. --Oui, Madame, repondit Odette. --Comment, mais je croyais que je vous reconduisais, s'ecria Swann, disant sans dissimulation, les mots necessaires, car la portiere etait ouverte, les secondes etaient comptees, et il ne pouvait rentrer sans elle dans l'etat ou il etait. --Mais Mme Verdurin m'a demande... --Voyons, vous pouvez bien revenir seul, nous vous l'avons laissee assez de fois, dit Mme Verdurin. --Mais c'est que j'avais une chose importante a dire a Madame. --Eh bien! vous la lui ecrirez... --Adieu, lui dit Odette en lui tendant la main. Il essaya de sourire mais il avait l'air atterre. --As-tu vu les facons que Swann se permet maintenant avec nous? dit Mme Verdurin a son mari quand ils furent rentres. J'ai cru qu'il allait me manger, parce que nous ramenions Odette. C'est d'une inconvenance, vraiment! Alors, qu'il dise tout de suite que nous tenons une maison de rendez-vous! Je ne comprends pas qu'Odette supporte des manieres pareilles. Il a absolument l'air de dire: vous m'appartenez. Je dirai ma maniere de penser a Odette, j'espere qu'elle comprendra. Et elle ajouta encore un instant apres, avec colere: --Non, mais voyez-vous, cette sale bete! employant sans s'en rendre compte, et peut-etre en obeissant au meme besoin obscur de se justifier--comme Francoise a Combray quand le poulet ne voulait pas mourir--les mots qu'arrachent les derniers sursauts d'un animal inoffensif qui agonise, au paysan qui est en train de l'ecraser. Et quand la voiture de Mme Verdurin fut partie et que celle de Swann s'avanca, son cocher le regardant lui demanda s'il n'etait pas malade ou s'il n'etait pas arrive de malheur. Swann le renvoya, il voulait marcher et ce fut a pied, par le Bois, qu'il rentra. Il parlait seul, a haute voix, et sur le meme ton un peu factice qu'il avait pris jusqu'ici quand il detaillait les charmes du petit noyau et exaltait la magnanimite des Verdurin. Mais de meme que les propos, les sourires, les baisers d'Odette lui devenaient aussi odieux qu'il les avait trouves doux, s'ils etaient adresses a d'autres que lui, de meme, le salon des Verdurin, qui tout a l'heure encore lui semblait amusant, respirant un gout vrai pour l'art et meme une sorte de noblesse morale, maintenant que c'etait un autre que lui qu'Odette allait y rencontrer, y aimer librement, lui exhibait ses ridicules, sa sottise, son ignominie. Il se representait avec degout la soiree du lendemain a Chatou. D'abord cette idee d'aller a Chatou! Comme des merciers qui viennent de fermer leur boutique! vraiment ces gens sont sublimes de bourgeoisisme, ils ne doivent pas exister reellement, ils doivent sortir du theatre de Labiche! Il y aurait la les Cottard, peut-etre Brichot. Est-ce assez grotesque cette vie de petites gens qui vivent les uns sur les autres, qui se croiraient perdus, ma parole, s'ils ne se retrouvaient pas tous demain a Chatou! Helas! il y aurait aussi le peintre, le peintre qui aimait a faire des mariages, qui inviterait Forcheville a venir avec Odette a son atelier. Il voyait Odette avec une toilette trop habillee pour cette partie de campagne, car elle est si vulgaire et surtout, la pauvre petite, elle est tellement bete!!! Il entendit les plaisanteries que ferait Mme Verdurin apres diner, les plaisanteries qui, quel que fut l'ennuyeux qu'elles eussent pour cible, l'avaient toujours amuse parce qu'il voyait Odette en rire, en rire avec lui, presque en lui. Maintenant il sentait que c'etait peut-etre de lui qu'on allait faire rire Odette. Quelle gaiete fetide! disait-il en donnant a sa bouche une expression de degout si forte qu'il avait lui-meme la sensation musculaire de sa grimace jusque dans son cou revulse contre le col de sa chemise. Et comment une creature dont le visage est fait a l'image de Dieu peut-elle trouver matiere a rire dans ces plaisanteries nauseabondes? Toute narine un peu delicate se detournerait avec horreur pour ne pas se laisser offusquer par de tels relents. C'est vraiment incroyable de penser qu'un etre humain peut ne pas comprendre qu'en se permettant un sourire a l'egard d'un semblable qui lui a tendu loyalement la main, il se degrade jusqu'a une fange d'ou il ne sera plus possible a la meilleure volonte du monde de jamais le relever. J'habite a trop de milliers de metres d'altitude au-dessus des bas-fonds ou clapotent et clabaudent de tels sales papotages, pour que je puisse etre eclabousse par les plaisanteries d'une Verdurin, s'ecria-t-il, en relevant la tete, en redressant fierement son corps en arriere. Dieu m'est temoin que j'ai sincerement voulu tirer Odette de la, et l'elever dans une atmosphere plus noble et plus pure. Mais la patience humaine a des bornes, et la mienne est a bout, se dit-il, comme si cette mission d'arracher Odette a une atmosphere de sarcasmes datait de plus longtemps que de quelques minutes, et comme s'il ne se l'etait pas donnee seulement depuis qu'il pensait que ces sarcasmes l'avaient peut-etre lui-meme pour objet et tentaient de detacher Odette de lui. Il voyait le pianiste pret a jouer la sonate Clair de lune et les mines de Mme Verdurin s'effrayant du mal que la musique de Beethoven allait faire a ses nerfs: Idiote, menteuse! s'ecria-t-il, et ca croit aimer l'Art! Elle dirait a Odette, apres lui avoir insinue adroitement quelques mots louangeurs pour Forcheville,",3.54006429954395,1.5625052784315405,0.34107103534112276,0.09949353897874998,4.611039794608472,4.0,2.597061897178144,22.257142857142856,18.5,16.75340964382706,1.3498074454428755,1.0,0.6780791710062507,1558,624,0.40051347881899874,8402,70,27.95522548266583,1382929903114.076,712850465.5227195,0.660794960429379,0.650153590421028,70.05029011553275,9.018013570511645,10.732481090015153,12.086425820649184,11.416568861177332,9.98300385109114,44.7218411883367,5.0,True,69.0,0.8737113402061856,4.330927835051546,1940.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010534684953289604,0.002583979328165375,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01311866428145498,0.004472271914132379,0.0,0.1541237113402062,66,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"comme elle avait fait si souvent pour lui: Vous allez faire une petite place a cote de vous a M. de Forcheville. Dans l'obscurite! maquerelle, entremetteuse! Entremetteuse, c'etait le nom qu'il donnait aussi a la musique qui les convierait a se taire, a rever ensemble, a se regarder, a se prendre la main. Il trouvait du bon a la severite contre les arts, de Platon, de Bossuet, et de la vieille education francaise. En somme la vie qu'on menait chez les Verdurin et qu'il avait appelee si souvent la vraie vie, lui semblait la pire de toutes, et leur petit noyau le dernier des milieux. C'est vraiment, disait-il, ce qu'il y a de plus bas dans l'echelle sociale, le dernier cercle de Dante. Nul doute que le texte auguste ne se refere aux Verdurin! Au fond, comme les gens du monde dont on peut medire, mais qui tout de meme sont autre chose que ces bandes de voyous, montrent leur profonde sagesse en refusant de les connaitre, d'y salir meme le bout de leurs doigts. Quelle divination dans ce Noli me tangere du faubourg Saint-Germain. Il avait quitte depuis bien longtemps les allees du Bois, il etait presque arrive chez lui, que, pas encore degrise de sa douleur et de la verve d'insincerite dont les intonations menteuses, la sonorite artificielle de sa propre voix lui versaient d'instant en instant plus abondamment l'ivresse, il continuait encore a perorer tout haut dans le silence de la nuit: Les gens du monde ont leurs defauts que personne ne reconnait mieux que moi, mais enfin ce sont tout de meme des gens avec qui certaines choses sont impossibles. Telle femme elegante que j'ai connue etait loin d'etre parfaite, mais enfin il y avait tout de meme chez elle un fond de delicatesse, une loyaute dans les procedes qui l'auraient rendue, quoi qu'il arrivat, incapable d'une felonie et qui suffisent a mettre des abimes entre elle et une megere comme la Verdurin. Verdurin! quel nom! Ah! on peut dire qu'ils sont complets, qu'ils sont beaux dans leur genre! Dieu merci, il n'etait que temps de ne plus condescendre a la promiscuite avec cette infamie, avec ces ordures. Mais, comme les vertus qu'il attribuait tantot encore aux Verdurin, n'auraient pas suffi, meme s'ils les avaient vraiment possedees, mais s'ils n'avaient pas favorise et protege son amour, a provoquer chez Swann cette ivresse ou il s'attendrissait sur leur magnanimite et qui, meme propagee a travers d'autres personnes, ne pouvait lui venir que d'Odette,--de meme, l'immoralite, eut-elle ete reelle, qu'il trouvait aujourd'hui aux Verdurin aurait ete impuissante, s'ils n'avaient pas invite Odette avec Forcheville et sans lui, a dechainer son indignation et a lui faire fletrir leur infamie. Et sans doute la voix de Swann etait plus clairvoyante que lui-meme, quand elle se refusait a prononcer ces mots pleins de degout pour le milieu Verdurin et de la joie d'en avoir fini avec lui, autrement que sur un ton factice et comme s'ils etaient choisis plutot pour assouvir sa colere que pour exprimer sa pensee. Celle-ci, en effet, pendant qu'il se livrait a ces invectives, etait probablement, sans qu'il s'en apercut, occupee d'un objet tout a fait different, car une fois arrive chez lui, a peine eut-il referme la porte cochere, que brusquement il se frappa le front, et, la faisant rouvrir, ressortit en s'ecriant d'une voix naturelle cette fois: Je crois que j'ai trouve le moyen de me faire inviter demain au diner de Chatou! Mais le moyen devait etre mauvais, car Swann ne fut pas invite: le docteur Cottard qui, appele en province pour un cas grave, n'avait pas vu les Verdurin depuis plusieurs jours et n'avait pu aller a Chatou, dit, le lendemain de ce diner, en se mettant a table chez eux: --Mais, est-ce que nous ne verrons pas M. Swann, ce soir? Il est bien ce qu'on appelle un ami personnel du... --Mais j'espere bien que non! s'ecria Mme Verdurin, Dieu nous en preserve, il est assommant, bete et mal eleve. Cottard a ces mots manifesta en meme temps son etonnement et sa soumission, comme devant une verite contraire a tout ce qu'il avait cru jusque-la, mais d'une evidence irresistible; et, baissant d'un air emu et peureux son nez dans son assiette, il se contenta de repondre: Ah! -ah! en traversant a reculons, dans sa retraite repliee en bon ordre jusqu'au fond de lui-meme, le long d'une gamme descendante, tout le registre de sa voix. Et il ne fut plus question de Swann chez les Verdurin. Alors ce salon qui avait reuni Swann et Odette devint un obstacle a leurs rendez-vous. Elle ne lui disait plus comme au premier temps de leur amour: Nous nous venons en tous cas demain soir, il y a un souper chez les Verdurin. Mais: Nous ne pourrons pas nous voir demain soir, il y a un souper chez les Verdurin. Ou bien les Verdurin devaient l'emmener a l'Opera-Comique voir Une nuit de Cleopatre et Swann lisait dans les yeux d'Odette cet effroi qu'il lui demandat de n'y pas aller, que naguere il n'aurait pu se retenir de baiser au passage sur le visage de sa maitresse, et qui maintenant l'exasperait. Ce n'est pas de la colere, pourtant, se disait-il a lui-meme, que j'eprouve en voyant l'envie qu'elle a d'aller picorer dans cette musique stercoraire. C'est du chagrin, non pas certes pour moi, mais pour elle; du chagrin de voir qu'apres avoir vecu plus de six mois en contact quotidien avec moi, elle n'a pas su devenir assez une autre pour eliminer spontanement Victor Masse! Surtout pour ne pas etre arrivee a comprendre qu'il y a des soirs ou un etre d'une essence un peu delicate doit savoir renoncer a un plaisir, quand on le lui demande. Elle devrait savoir dire je n'irai pas, ne fut-ce que par intelligence, puisque c'est sur sa reponse qu'on classera une fois pour toutes sa qualite d'ame. Et s'etant persuade a lui-meme que c'etait seulement en effet pour pouvoir porter un jugement plus favorable sur la valeur spirituelle d'Odette qu'il desirait que ce soir-la elle restat avec lui au lieu d'aller a l'Opera-Comique, il lui tenait le meme raisonnement, au meme degre d'insincerite qu'a soi-meme, et meme, a un degre de plus, car alors il obeissait aussi au desir de la prendre par l'amour-propre. --Je te jure, lui disait-il, quelques instants avant qu'elle partit pour le theatre, qu'en te demandant de ne pas sortir, tous mes souhaits, si j'etais egoiste, seraient pour que tu me refuses, car j'ai mille choses a faire ce soir et je me trouverai moi-meme pris au piege et bien ennuye si contre toute attente tu me reponds que tu n'iras pas. Mais mes occupations, mes plaisirs, ne sont pas tout, je dois penser a toi. Il peut venir un jour ou me voyant a jamais detache de toi tu auras le droit de me reprocher de ne pas t'avoir avertie dans les minutes decisives ou je sentais que j'allais porter sur toi un de ces jugements severes auxquels l'amour ne resiste pas longtemps. Vois-tu, Une nuit de Cleopatre (quel titre!) n'est rien dans la circonstance. Ce qu'il faut savoir c'est si vraiment tu es cet etre qui est au dernier rang de l'esprit, et meme du charme, l'etre meprisable qui n'est pas capable de renoncer a un plaisir. Alors, si tu es cela, comment pourrait-on t'aimer, car tu n'es meme pas une personne, une creature definie, imparfaite, mais du moins perfectible? Tu es une eau informe qui coule selon la pente qu'on lui offre, un poisson sans memoire et sans reflexion qui tant qu'il vivra dans son aquarium se heurtera cent fois par jour contre le vitrage qu'il continuera a prendre pour de l'eau. Comprends-tu que ta reponse, je ne dis pas aura pour effet que je cesserai de t'aimer immediatement, bien entendu, mais te rendra moins seduisante a mes yeux quand je comprendrai que tu n'es pas une personne, que tu es au-dessous de toutes les choses et ne sais te placer au-dessus d'aucune? Evidemment j'aurais mieux aime te demander comme une chose sans importance, de renoncer a Une nuit de Cleopatre (puisque tu m'obliges a me souiller les levres de ce nom abject) dans l'espoir que tu irais cependant. Mais, decide a tenir un tel compte, a tirer de telles consequences de ta reponse, j'ai trouve plus loyal de t'en prevenir. Odette depuis un moment donnait des signes d'emotion et d'incertitude. A defaut du sens de ce discours, elle comprenait qu'il pouvait rentrer dans le genre commun des laius, et scenes de reproches ou de supplications dont l'habitude qu'elle avait des hommes lui permettait sans s'attacher aux details des mots, de conclure qu'ils ne les prononceraient pas s'ils n'etaient pas amoureux, que du moment qu'ils etaient amoureux, il etait inutile de leur obeir, qu'ils ne le seraient que plus apres. Aussi aurait-elle ecoute Swann avec le plus grand calme si elle n'avait vu que l'heure passait et que pour peu qu'il parlat encore quelque temps, elle allait, comme elle le lui dit avec un sourire tendre, obstine et confus, finir par manquer l'Ouverture! D'autres fois il lui disait que ce qui plus que tout ferait qu'il cesserait de l'aimer, c'est qu'elle ne voulut pas renoncer a mentir. Meme au simple point de vue de la coquetterie, lui disait-il, ne comprends-tu donc pas combien tu perds de ta seduction en t'abaissant a mentir? Par un aveu! combien de fautes tu pourrais racheter! Vraiment tu es bien moins intelligente que je ne croyais! Mais c'est en vain que Swann lui exposait ainsi toutes les raisons qu'elle avait de ne pas mentir; elles auraient pu ruiner chez Odette un systeme general du mensonge; mais Odette n'en possedait pas; elle se contentait seulement, dans chaque cas ou elle voulait que Swann ignorat quelque chose qu'elle avait fait, de ne pas le lui dire. Ainsi le mensonge etait pour elle un expedient d'ordre particulier; et ce qui seul pouvait decider si",3.933747232972323,1.6775806911700428,0.3391800122966059,0.09250921359296013,4.391136801541426,4.0,2.452476719621088,27.31578947368421,21.0,22.181988817180105,1.3018625561978163,1.0,0.6177239795866298,1557,604,0.38792549775208734,7986,57,25.530975818372667,122450881401.71048,63413195.96152795,0.7176258466871721,0.7229181689294901,68.97190142987529,10.425136057871075,10.581452260228062,13.41828753000034,12.910149072102222,8.936262042389206,47.99658587702397,5.649122807017544,True,67.0,0.8767477990678405,4.13568099430347,1931.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01803856520837653,0.013269749118805723,0.009952311839104291,0.009952311839104291,0.009952311839104291,0.009952311839104291,0.0037321169396641093,0.00704955421936554,0.003110097449720091,0.12480580010357328,67,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"elle devait s'en servir ou avouer la verite, c'etait une raison d'ordre particulier aussi, la chance plus ou moins grande qu'il y avait pour que Swann put decouvrir qu'elle n'avait pas dit la verite. Physiquement, elle traversait une mauvaise phase: elle epaississait; et le charme expressif et dolent, les regards etonnes et reveurs qu'elle avait autrefois semblaient avoir disparu avec sa premiere jeunesse. De sorte qu'elle etait devenue si chere a Swann au moment pour ainsi dire ou il la trouvait precisement bien moins jolie. Il la regardait longuement pour tacher de ressaisir le charme qu'il lui avait connu, et ne le retrouvait pas. Mais savoir que sous cette chrysalide nouvelle, c'etait toujours Odette qui vivait, toujours la meme volonte fugace, insaisissable et sournoise, suffisait a Swann pour qu'il continuat de mettre la meme passion a chercher a la capter. Puis il regardait des photographies d'il y avait deux ans, il se rappelait comme elle avait ete delicieuse. Et cela le consolait un peu de se donner tant de mal pour elle. Quand les Verdurin l'emmenaient a Saint-Germain, a Chatou, a Meulan, souvent, si c'etait dans la belle saison, ils proposaient, sur place, de rester a coucher et de ne revenir que le lendemain. Mme Verdurin cherchait a apaiser les scrupules du pianiste dont la tante etait restee a Paris. --Elle sera enchantee d'etre debarrassee de vous pour un jour. Et comment s'inquieterait-elle, elle vous sait avec nous? d'ailleurs je prends tout sous mon bonnet. Mais si elle n'y reussissait pas, M. Verdurin partait en campagne, trouvait un bureau de telegraphe ou un messager et s'informait de ceux des fideles qui avaient quelqu'un a faire prevenir. Mais Odette le remerciait et disait qu'elle n'avait de depeche a faire pour personne, car elle avait dit a Swann une fois pour toutes qu'en lui en envoyant une aux yeux de tous, elle se compromettrait. Parfois c'etait pour plusieurs jours qu'elle s'absentait, les Verdurin l'emmenaient voir les tombeaux de Dreux, ou a Compiegne admirer, sur le conseil du peintre, des couchers de soleil en foret et on poussait jusqu'au chateau de Pierrefonds. --Penser qu'elle pourrait visiter de vrais monuments avec moi qui ai etudie l'architecture pendant dix ans et qui suis tout le temps supplie de mener a Beauvais ou a Saint-Loup-de-Naud des gens de la plus haute valeur et ne le ferais que pour elle, et qu'a la place elle va avec les dernieres des brutes s'extasier successivement devant les dejections de Louis-Philippe et devant celles de Viollet-le-Duc! Il me semble qu'il n'y a pas besoin d'etre artiste pour cela et que, meme sans flair particulierement fin, on ne choisit pas d'aller villegiaturer dans des latrines pour etre plus a portee de respirer des excrements. Mais quand elle etait partie pour Dreux ou pour Pierrefonds,--helas, sans lui permettre d'y aller, comme par hasard, de son cote, car cela ferait un effet deplorable, disait-elle,--il se plongeait dans le plus enivrant des romans d'amour, l'indicateur des chemins de fer, qui lui apprenait les moyens de la rejoindre, l'apres-midi, le soir, ce matin meme! Le moyen? presque davantage: l'autorisation. Car enfin l'indicateur et les trains eux-memes n'etaient pas faits pour des chiens. Si on faisait savoir au public, par voie d'imprimes, qu'a huit heures du matin partait un train qui arrivait a Pierrefonds a dix heures, c'est donc qu'aller a Pierrefonds etait un acte licite, pour lequel la permission d'Odette etait superflue; et c'etait aussi un acte qui pouvait avoir un tout autre motif que le desir de rencontrer Odette, puisque des gens qui ne la connaissaient pas l'accomplissaient chaque jour, en assez grand nombre pour que cela valut la peine de faire chauffer des locomotives. En somme elle ne pouvait tout de meme pas l'empecher d'aller a Pierrefonds s'il en avait envie! Or, justement, il sentait qu'il en avait envie, et que s'il n'avait pas connu Odette, certainement il y serait alle. Il y avait longtemps qu'il voulait se faire une idee plus precise des travaux de restauration de Viollet-le-Duc. Et par le temps qu'il faisait, il eprouvait l'imperieux desir d'une promenade dans la foret de Compiegne. Ce n'etait vraiment pas de chance qu'elle lui defendit le seul endroit qui le tentait aujourd'hui. Aujourd'hui! S'il y allait, malgre son interdiction, il pourrait la voir aujourd'hui meme! Mais, alors que, si elle eut retrouve a Pierrefonds quelque indifferent, elle lui eut dit joyeusement: Tiens, vous ici!, et lui aurait demande d'aller la voir a l'hotel ou elle etait descendue avec les Verdurin, au contraire si elle l'y rencontrait, lui, Swann, elle serait froissee, elle se dirait qu'elle etait suivie, elle l'aimerait moins, peut-etre se detournerait-elle avec colere en l'apercevant. Alors, je n'ai plus le droit de voyager!, lui dirait-elle au retour, tandis qu'en somme c'etait lui qui n'avait plus le droit de voyager! Il avait eu un moment l'idee, pour pouvoir aller a Compiegne et a Pierrefonds sans avoir l'air que ce fut pour rencontrer Odette, de s'y faire emmener par un de ses amis, le marquis de Forestelle, qui avait un chateau dans le voisinage. Celui-ci, a qui il avait fait part de son projet sans lui en dire le motif, ne se sentait pas de joie et s'emerveillait que Swann, pour la premiere fois depuis quinze ans, consentit enfin a venir voir sa propriete et, quoiqu'il ne voulait pas s'y arreter, lui avait-il dit, lui promit du moins de faire ensemble des promenades et des excursions pendant plusieurs jours. Swann s'imaginait deja la-bas avec M. de Forestelle. Meme avant d'y voir Odette, meme s'il ne reussissait pas a l'y voir, quel bonheur il aurait a mettre le pied sur cette terre ou ne sachant pas l'endroit exact, a tel moment, de sa presence, il sentirait palpiter partout la possibilite de sa brusque apparition: dans la cour du chateau, devenu beau pour lui parce que c'etait a cause d'elle qu'il etait alle le voir; dans toutes les rues de la ville, qui lui semblait romanesque; sur chaque route de la foret, rosee par un couchant profond et tendre;--asiles innombrables et alternatifs, ou venait simultanement se refugier, dans l'incertaine ubiquite de ses esperances, son cur heureux, vagabond et multiplie. Surtout, dirait-il a M. de Forestelle, prenons garde de ne pas tomber sur Odette et les Verdurin; je viens d'apprendre qu'ils sont justement aujourd'hui a Pierrefonds. On a assez le temps de se voir a Paris, ce ne serait pas la peine de le quitter pour ne pas pouvoir faire un pas les uns sans les autres. Et son ami ne comprendrait pas pourquoi une fois la-bas il changerait vingt fois de projets, inspecterait les salles a manger de tous les hotels de Compiegne sans se decider a s'asseoir dans aucune de celles ou pourtant on n'avait pas vu trace de Verdurin, ayant l'air de rechercher ce qu'il disait vouloir fuir et du reste le fuyant des qu'il l'aurait trouve, car s'il avait rencontre le petit groupe, il s'en serait ecarte avec affectation, content d'avoir vu Odette et qu'elle l'eut vu, surtout qu'elle l'eut vu ne se souciant pas d'elle. Mais non, elle devinerait bien que c'etait pour elle qu'il etait la. Et quand M. de Forestelle venait le chercher pour partir, il lui disait: Helas! non, je ne peux pas aller aujourd'hui a Pierrefonds, Odette y est justement. Et Swann etait heureux malgre tout de sentir que, si seul de tous les mortels il n'avait pas le droit en ce jour d'aller a Pierrefonds, c'etait parce qu'il etait en effet pour Odette quelqu'un de different des autres, son amant, et que cette restriction apportee pour lui au droit universel de libre circulation, n'etait qu'une des formes de cet esclavage, de cet amour qui lui etait si cher. Decidement il valait mieux ne pas risquer de se brouiller avec elle, patienter, attendre son retour. Il passait ses journees penche sur une carte de la foret de Compiegne comme si c'avait ete la carte du Tendre, s'entourait de photographies du chateau de Pierrefonds. Des que venait le jour ou il etait possible qu'elle revint, il rouvrait l'indicateur, calculait quel train elle avait du prendre, et si elle s'etait attardee, ceux qui lui restaient encore. Il ne sortait pas de peur de manquer une depeche, ne se couchait pas, pour le cas ou, revenue par le dernier train, elle aurait voulu lui faire la surprise de venir le voir au milieu de la nuit. Justement il entendait sonner a la porte cochere, il lui semblait qu'on tardait a ouvrir, il voulait eveiller le concierge, se mettait a la fenetre pour appeler Odette si c'etait elle, car malgre les recommandations qu'il etait descendu faire plus de dix fois lui-meme, on etait capable de lui dire qu'il n'etait pas la. C'etait un domestique qui rentrait. Il remarquait le vol incessant des voitures qui passaient, auquel il n'avait jamais fait attention autrefois. Il ecoutait chacune venir au loin, s'approcher, depasser sa porte sans s'etre arretee et porter plus loin un message qui n'etait pas pour lui. Il attendait toute la nuit, bien inutilement, car les Verdurin ayant avance leur retour, Odette etait a Paris depuis midi; elle n'avait pas eu l'idee de l'en prevenir; ne sachant que faire elle avait ete passer sa soiree seule au theatre et il y avait longtemps qu'elle etait rentree se coucher et dormait. C'est qu'elle n'avait meme pas pense a lui. Et de tels moments ou elle oubliait jusqu'a l'existence de Swann etaient plus utiles a Odette, servaient mieux a lui attacher Swann, que toute sa coquetterie. Car ainsi Swann vivait dans cette agitation douloureuse qui avait deja ete assez puissante pour faire eclore son amour le soir ou il n'avait pas trouve Odette chez les Verdurin et l'avait cherchee toute la soiree. Et il n'avait pas, comme j'eus a Combray dans mon enfance, des journees heureuses pendant lesquelles s'oublient les souffrances qui renaitront le soir. Les journees, Swann les passait sans Odette; et par moments il se disait que laisser une aussi jolie femme sortir",4.070226793874413,2.1287238400376784,0.315913534601394,0.09439616869941617,4.556278464541315,4.0,2.639889924069147,27.446428571428573,20.5,21.50408569390041,1.3051398828887444,1.0,0.635067911637124,1537,570,0.3708523096942095,8292,56,26.528549319359094,332049310142.2566,173665957.18737268,0.7756234179843556,0.7730697255443644,68.56204090761224,10.514757760944327,10.876741818643914,13.659117947764663,13.75328585370388,9.912452830188684,48.65657821358863,5.821428571428571,True,59.0,0.8807531380753139,4.336820083682008,1912.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008440514469453377,0.008440514469453377,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0040192926045016075,0.00482315112540193,0.0,0.1307531380753138,68,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"ainsi seule dans Paris etait aussi imprudent que de poser un ecrin plein de bijoux au milieu de la rue. Alors il s'indignait contre tous les passants comme contre autant de voleurs. Mais leur visage collectif et informe echappant a son imagination ne nourrissait pas sa jalousie. Il fatiguait la pensee de Swann, lequel, se passant la main sur les yeux, s'ecriait: A la grace de Dieu, comme ceux qui apres s'etre acharnes a etreindre le probleme de la realite du monde exterieur ou de l'immortalite de l'ame accordent la detente d'un acte de foi a leur cerveau lasse. Mais toujours la pensee de l'absente etait indissolublement melee aux actes les plus simples de la vie de Swann,--dejeuner, recevoir son courrier, sortir, se coucher,--par la tristesse meme qu'il avait a les accomplir sans elle, comme ces initiales de Philibert le Beau que dans l'eglise de Brou, a cause du regret qu'elle avait de lui, Marguerite d'Autriche entrelaca partout aux siennes. Certains jours, au lieu de rester chez lui, il allait prendre son dejeuner dans un restaurant assez voisin dont il avait apprecie autrefois la bonne cuisine et ou maintenant il n'allait plus que pour une de ces raisons, a la fois mystiques et saugrenues, qu'on appelle romanesques; c'est que ce restaurant (lequel existe encore) portait le meme nom que la rue habitee par Odette: Laperouse. Quelquefois, quand elle avait fait un court deplacement ce n'est qu'apres plusieurs jours qu'elle songeait a lui faire savoir qu'elle etait revenue a Paris. Et elle lui disait tout simplement, sans plus prendre comme autrefois la precaution de se couvrir a tout hasard d'un petit morceau emprunte a la verite, qu'elle venait d'y rentrer a l'instant meme par le train du matin. Ces paroles etaient mensongeres; du moins pour Odette elles etaient mensongeres, inconsistantes, n'ayant pas, comme si elles avaient ete vraies, un point d'appui dans le souvenir de son arrivee a la gare; meme elle etait empechee de se les representer au moment ou elle les prononcait, par l'image contradictoire de ce qu'elle avait fait de tout different au moment ou elle pretendait etre descendue du train. Mais dans l'esprit de Swann au contraire ces paroles qui ne rencontraient aucun obstacle venaient s'incruster et prendre l'inamovibilite d'une verite si indubitable que si un ami lui disait etre venu par ce train et ne pas avoir vu Odette il etait persuade que c'etait l'ami qui se trompait de jour ou d'heure puisque son dire ne se conciliait pas avec les paroles d'Odette. Celles-ci ne lui eussent paru mensongeres que s'il s'etait d'abord defie qu'elles le fussent. Pour qu'il crut qu'elle mentait, un soupcon prealable etait une condition necessaire. C'etait d'ailleurs aussi une condition suffisante. Alors tout ce que disait Odette lui paraissait suspect. L'entendait-il citer un nom, c'etait certainement celui d'un de ses amants; une fois cette supposition forgee, il passait des semaines a se desoler; il s'aboucha meme une fois avec une agence de renseignements pour savoir l'adresse, l'emploi du temps de l'inconnu qui ne le laisserait respirer que quand il serait parti en voyage, et dont il finit par apprendre que c'etait un oncle d'Odette mort depuis vingt ans. Bien qu'elle ne lui permit pas en general de la rejoindre dans des lieux publics disant que cela ferait jaser, il arrivait que dans une soiree ou il etait invite comme elle,--chez Forcheville, chez le peintre, ou a un bal de charite dans un ministere,--il se trouvat en meme temps qu'elle. Il la voyait mais n'osait pas rester de peur de l'irriter en ayant l'air d'epier les plaisirs qu'elle prenait avec d'autres et qui--tandis qu'il rentrait solitaire, qu'il allait se coucher anxieux comme je devais l'etre moi-meme quelques annees plus tard les soirs ou il viendrait diner a la maison, a Combray--lui semblaient illimites parce qu'il n'en avait pas vu la fin. Et une fois ou deux il connut par de tels soirs de ces joies qu'on serait tente, si elles ne subissaient avec tant de violence le choc en retour de l'inquietude brusquement arretee, d'appeler des joies calmes, parce qu'elles consistent en un apaisement: il etait alle passer un instant a un raout chez le peintre et s'appretait a le quitter; il y laissait Odette muee en une brillante etrangere, au milieu d'hommes a qui ses regards et sa gaiete qui n'etaient pas pour lui, semblaient parler de quelque volupte, qui serait goutee la ou ailleurs (peut-etre au Bal des Incoherents ou il tremblait qu'elle n'allat ensuite) et qui causait a Swann plus de jalousie que l'union charnelle meme parce qu'il l'imaginait plus difficilement; il etait deja pret a passer la porte de l'atelier quand il s'entendait rappeler par ces mots (qui en retranchant de la fete cette fin qui l'epouvantait, la lui rendaient retrospectivement innocente, faisaient du retour d'Odette une chose non plus inconcevable et terrible, mais douce et connue et qui tiendrait a cote de lui, pareille a un peu de sa vie de tous les jours, dans sa voiture, et depouillait Odette elle-meme de son apparence trop brillante et gaie, montraient que ce n'etait qu'un deguisement qu'elle avait revetu un moment, pour lui-meme, non en vue de mysterieux plaisirs, et duquel elle etait deja lasse), par ces mots qu'Odette lui jetait, comme il etait deja sur le seuil: Vous ne voudriez pas m'attendre cinq minutes, je vais partir, nous reviendrions ensemble, vous me rameneriez chez moi. Il est vrai qu'un jour Forcheville avait demande a etre ramene en meme temps, mais comme, arrive devant la porte d'Odette il avait sollicite la permission d'entrer aussi, Odette lui avait repondu en montrant Swann: Ah! cela depend de ce monsieur-la, demandez-lui. Enfin, entrez un moment si vous voulez, mais pas longtemps parce que je vous previens qu'il aime causer tranquillement avec moi, et qu'il n'aime pas beaucoup qu'il y ait des visites quand il vient. Ah! si vous connaissiez cet etre-la autant que je le connais; n'est-ce pas, my love, il n'y a que moi qui vous connaisse bien? Et Swann etait peut-etre encore plus touche de la voir ainsi lui adresser en presence de Forcheville, non seulement ces paroles de tendresse, de predilection, mais encore certaines critiques comme: Je suis sure que vous n'avez pas encore repondu a vos amis pour votre diner de dimanche. N'y allez pas si vous ne voulez pas, mais soyez au moins poli, ou: Avez-vous laisse seulement ici votre essai sur Ver Meer pour pouvoir l'avancer un peu demain? Quel paresseux! Je vous ferai travailler, moi! qui prouvaient qu'Odette se tenait au courant de ses invitations dans le monde et de ses etudes d'art, qu'ils avaient bien une vie a eux deux. Et en disant cela elle lui adressait un sourire au fond duquel il la sentait toute a lui. Alors a ces moments-la, pendant qu'elle leur faisait de l'orangeade, tout d'un coup, comme quand un reflecteur mal regle d'abord promene autour d'un objet, sur la muraille, de grandes ombres fantastiques qui viennent ensuite se replier et s'aneantir en lui, toutes les idees terribles et mouvantes qu'il se faisait d'Odette s'evanouissaient, rejoignaient le corps charmant que Swann avait devant lui. Il avait le brusque soupcon que cette heure passee chez Odette, sous la lampe, n'etait peut-etre pas une heure factice, a son usage a lui (destinee a masquer cette chose effrayante et delicieuse a laquelle il pensait sans cesse sans pouvoir bien se la representer, une heure de la vraie vie d'Odette, de la vie d'Odette quand lui n'etait pas la), avec des accessoires de theatre et des fruits de carton, mais etait peut-etre une heure pour de bon de la vie d'Odette, que s'il n'avait pas ete la elle eut avance a Forcheville le meme fauteuil et lui eut verse non un breuvage inconnu, mais precisement cette orangeade; que le monde habite par Odette n'etait pas cet autre monde effroyable et surnaturel ou il passait son temps a la situer et qui n'existait peut-etre que dans son imagination, mais l'univers reel, ne degageant aucune tristesse speciale, comprenant cette table ou il allait pouvoir ecrire et cette boisson a laquelle il lui serait permis de gouter, tous ces objets qu'il contemplait avec autant de curiosite et d'admiration que de gratitude, car si en absorbant ses reves ils l'en avaient delivre, eux en revanche, s'en etaient enrichis, ils lui en montraient la realisation palpable, et ils interessaient son esprit, ils prenaient du relief devant ses regards, en meme temps qu'ils tranquillisaient son cur. Ah! si le destin avait permis qu'il put n'avoir qu'une seule demeure avec Odette et que chez elle il fut chez lui, si en demandant au domestique ce qu'il y avait a dejeuner c'eut ete le menu d'Odette qu'il avait appris en reponse, si quand Odette voulait aller le matin se promener avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, son devoir de bon mari l'avait oblige, n'eut-il pas envie de sortir, a l'accompagner, portant son manteau quand elle avait trop chaud, et le soir apres le diner si elle avait envie de rester chez elle en deshabille, s'il avait ete force de rester la pres d'elle, a faire ce qu'elle voudrait; alors combien tous les riens de la vie de Swann qui lui semblaient si tristes, au contraire parce qu'ils auraient en meme temps fait partie de la vie d'Odette auraient pris, meme les plus familiers,--et comme cette lampe, cette orangeade, ce fauteuil qui contenaient tant de reve, qui materialisaient tant de desir--une sorte de douceur surabondante et de densite mysterieuse. Pourtant il se doutait bien que ce qu'il regrettait ainsi c'etait un calme, une paix qui n'auraient pas ete pour son amour une atmosphere favorable. Quand Odette cesserait d'etre pour lui une creature toujours absente, regrettee, imaginaire, quand le sentiment qu'il aurait pour elle ne serait plus ce meme trouble mysterieux que lui causait la phrase de la sonate, mais de l'affection, de la reconnaissance quand s'etabliraient entre eux des rapports normaux qui mettraient fin a sa folie et a sa tristesse, alors sans doute les actes de la",4.120139837497951,1.6099245224538894,0.32434483293858996,0.10233821790415913,4.5893437296946065,4.0,2.6880798692513452,42.75,27.5,49.49487908415936,1.3034437946718649,1.0,0.6363944428316074,1539,599,0.38921377517868744,8321,36,21.201786055377262,1613684733.6079843,856975.4294253767,0.7483009610857282,0.7393628002747017,53.172404970760255,16.463136777128003,12.111423428081771,19.413190383365823,21.560808966861593,10.492943469785569,64.06254061078621,9.11111111111111,True,47.0,0.8948486457780138,4.419012214551248,1883.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007013325318104399,0.004508566275924256,0.005410279531109108,0.1407328730748805,69,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"vie d'Odette lui paraitraient peu interessants en eux-memes--comme il avait deja eu plusieurs fois le soupcon qu'ils etaient, par exemple le jour ou il avait lu a travers l'enveloppe la lettre adressee a Forcheville. Considerant son mal avec autant de sagacite que s'il se l'etait inocule pour en faire l'etude, il se disait que, quand il serait gueri, ce que pourrait faire Odette lui serait indifferent. Mais du sein de son etat morbide, a vrai dire, il redoutait a l'egal de la mort une telle guerison, qui eut ete en effet la mort de tout ce qu'il etait actuellement. Apres ces tranquilles soirees, les soupcons de Swann etaient calmes; il benissait Odette et le lendemain, des le matin, il faisait envoyer chez elle les plus beaux bijoux, parce que ces bontes de la veille avaient excite ou sa gratitude, ou le desir de les voir se renouveler, ou un paroxysme d'amour qui avait besoin de se depenser. Mais, a d'autres moments, sa douleur le reprenait, il s'imaginait qu'Odette etait la maitresse de Forcheville et que quand tous deux l'avaient vu, du fond du landau des Verdurin, au Bois, la veille de la fete de Chatou ou il n'avait pas ete invite, la prier vainement, avec cet air de desespoir qu'avait remarque jusqu'a son cocher, de revenir avec lui, puis s'en retourner de son cote, seul et vaincu, elle avait du avoir pour le designer a Forcheville et lui dire: Hein! ce qu'il rage! les memes regards, brillants, malicieux, abaisses et sournois, que le jour ou celui-ci avait chasse Saniette de chez les Verdurin. Alors Swann la detestait. Mais aussi, je suis trop bete, se disait-il, je paie avec mon argent le plaisir des autres. Elle fera tout de meme bien de faire attention et de ne pas trop tirer sur la corde, car je pourrais bien ne plus rien donner du tout. En tous cas, renoncons provisoirement aux gentillesses supplementaires! Penser que pas plus tard qu'hier, comme elle disait avoir envie d'assister a la saison de Bayreuth, j'ai eu la betise de lui proposer de louer un des jolis chateaux du roi de Baviere pour nous deux dans les environs. Et d'ailleurs elle n'a pas paru plus ravie que cela, elle n'a encore dit ni oui ni non; esperons qu'elle refusera, grand Dieu! Entendre du Wagner pendant quinze jours avec elle qui s'en soucie comme un poisson d'une pomme, ce serait gai! Et sa haine, tout comme son amour, ayant besoin de se manifester et d'agir, il se plaisait a pousser de plus en plus loin ses imaginations mauvaises, parce que, grace aux perfidies qu'il pretait a Odette, il la detestait davantage et pourrait si--ce qu'il cherchait a se figurer--elles se trouvaient etre vraies, avoir une occasion de la punir et d'assouvir sur elle sa rage grandissante. Il alla ainsi jusqu'a supposer qu'il allait recevoir une lettre d'elle ou elle lui demanderait de l'argent pour louer ce chateau pres de Bayreuth, mais en le prevenant qu'il n'y pourrait pas venir, parce qu'elle avait promis a Forcheville et aux Verdurin de les inviter. Ah! comme il eut aime qu'elle put avoir cette audace. Quelle joie il aurait a refuser, a rediger la reponse vengeresse dont il se complaisait a choisir, a enoncer tout haut les termes, comme s'il avait recu la lettre en realite. Or, c'est ce qui arriva le lendemain meme. Elle lui ecrivit que les Verdurin et leurs amis avaient manifeste le desir d'assister a ces representations de Wagner et que, s'il voulait bien lui envoyer cet argent, elle aurait enfin, apres avoir ete si souvent recue chez eux, le plaisir de les inviter a son tour. De lui, elle ne disait pas un mot, il etait sous-entendu que leur presence excluait la sienne. Alors cette terrible reponse dont il avait arrete chaque mot la veille sans oser esperer qu'elle pourrait servir jamais il avait la joie de la lui faire porter. Helas! il sentait bien qu'avec l'argent qu'elle avait, ou qu'elle trouverait facilement, elle pourrait tout de meme louer a Bayreuth puisqu'elle en avait envie, elle qui n'etait pas capable de faire de difference entre Bach et Clapisson. Mais elle y vivrait malgre tout plus chichement. Pas moyen comme s'il lui eut envoye cette fois quelques billets de mille francs, d'organiser chaque soir, dans un chateau, de ces soupers fins apres lesquels elle se serait peut-etre passe la fantaisie,--qu'il etait possible qu'elle n'eut jamais eue encore--, de tomber dans les bras de Forcheville. Et puis du moins, ce voyage deteste, ce n'etait pas lui, Swann, qui le paierait! --Ah! s'il avait pu l'empecher, si elle avait pu se fouler le pied avant de partir, si le cocher de la voiture qui l'emmenerait a la gare avait consenti, a n'importe quel prix, a la conduire dans un lieu ou elle fut restee quelque temps sequestree, cette femme perfide, aux yeux emailles par un sourire de complicite adresse a Forcheville, qu'Odette etait pour Swann depuis quarante-huit heures. Mais elle ne l'etait jamais pour tres longtemps; au bout de quelques jours le regard luisant et fourbe perdait de son eclat et de sa duplicite, cette image d'une Odette execree disant a Forcheville: Ce qu'il rage! commencait a palir, a s'effacer. Alors, progressivement reparaissait et s'elevait en brillant doucement, le visage de l'autre Odette, de celle qui adressait aussi un sourire a Forcheville, mais un sourire ou il n'y avait pour Swann que de la tendresse, quand elle disait: Ne restez pas longtemps, car ce monsieur-la n'aime pas beaucoup que j'aie des visites quand il a envie d'etre aupres de moi. Ah! si vous connaissiez cet etre-la autant que je le connais!, ce meme sourire qu'elle avait pour remercier Swann de quelque trait de sa delicatesse qu'elle prisait si fort, de quelque conseil qu'elle lui avait demande dans une de ces circonstances graves ou elle n'avait confiance qu'en lui. Alors, a cette Odette-la, il se demandait comment il avait pu ecrire cette lettre outrageante dont sans doute jusqu'ici elle ne l'eut pas cru capable, et qui avait du le faire descendre du rang eleve, unique, que par sa bonte, sa loyaute, il avait conquis dans son estime. Il allait lui devenir moins cher, car c'etait pour ces qualites-la, qu'elle ne trouvait ni a Forcheville ni a aucun autre, qu'elle l'aimait. C'etait a cause d'elles qu'Odette lui temoignait si souvent une gentillesse qu'il comptait pour rien au moment ou il etait jaloux, parce qu'elle n'etait pas une marque de desir, et prouvait meme plutot de l'affection que de l'amour, mais dont il recommencait a sentir l'importance au fur et a mesure que la detente spontanee de ses soupcons, souvent accentuee par la distraction que lui apportait une lecture d'art ou la conversation d'un ami, rendait sa passion moins exigeante de reciprocites. Maintenant qu'apres cette oscillation, Odette etait naturellement revenue a la place d'ou la jalousie de Swann l'avait un moment ecartee, dans l'angle ou il la trouvait charmante, il se la figurait pleine de tendresse, avec un regard de consentement, si jolie ainsi, qu'il ne pouvait s'empecher d'avancer les levres vers elle comme si elle avait ete la et qu'il eut pu l'embrasser; et il lui gardait de ce regard enchanteur et bon autant de reconnaissance que si elle venait de l'avoir reellement et si cela n'eut pas ete seulement son imagination qui venait de le peindre pour donner satisfaction a son desir. Comme il avait du lui faire de la peine! Certes il trouvait des raisons valables a son ressentiment contre elle, mais elles n'auraient pas suffi a le lui faire eprouver s'il ne l'avait pas autant aimee. N'avait-il pas eu des griefs aussi graves contre d'autres femmes, auxquelles il eut neanmoins volontiers rendu service aujourd'hui, etant contre elles sans colere parce qu'il ne les aimait plus. S'il devait jamais un jour se trouver dans le meme etat d'indifference vis-a-vis d'Odette, il comprendrait que c'etait sa jalousie seule qui lui avait fait trouver quelque chose d'atroce, d'impardonnable, a ce desir, au fond si naturel, provenant d'un peu d'enfantillage et aussi d'une certaine delicatesse d'ame, de pouvoir a son tour, puisqu'une occasion s'en presentait, rendre des politesses aux Verdurin, jouer a la maitresse de maison. Il revenait a ce point de vue--oppose a celui de son amour et de sa jalousie et auquel il se placait quelquefois par une sorte d'equite intellectuelle et pour faire la part des diverses probabilites--d'ou il essayait de juger Odette comme s'il ne l'avait pas aimee, comme si elle etait pour lui une femme comme les autres, comme si la vie d'Odette n'avait pas ete, des qu'il n'etait plus la, differente, tramee en cachette de lui, ourdie contre lui. Pourquoi croire qu'elle gouterait la-bas avec Forcheville ou avec d'autres des plaisirs enivrants qu'elle n'avait pas connus aupres de lui et que seule sa jalousie forgeait de toutes pieces? A Bayreuth comme a Paris, s'il arrivait que Forcheville pensat a lui ce n'eut pu etre que comme a quelqu'un qui comptait beaucoup dans la vie d'Odette, a qui il etait oblige de ceder la place, quand ils se rencontraient chez elle. Si Forcheville et elle triomphaient d'etre la-bas malgre lui, c'est lui qui l'aurait voulu en cherchant inutilement a l'empecher d'y aller, tandis que s'il avait approuve son projet, d'ailleurs defendable, elle aurait eu l'air d'etre la-bas d'apres son avis, elle s'y serait sentie envoyee, logee par lui, et le plaisir qu'elle aurait eprouve a recevoir ces gens qui l'avaient tant recue, c'est a Swann qu'elle en aurait su gre. Et,--au lieu qu'elle allait partir brouillee avec lui, sans l'avoir revu--, s'il lui envoyait cet argent, s'il l'encourageait a ce voyage et s'occupait de le lui rendre agreable, elle allait accourir, heureuse, reconnaissante, et il aurait cette joie de la voir qu'il n'avait pas goutee depuis pres d'une semaine et que rien ne pouvait lui remplacer. Car sitot que Swann pouvait se la representer sans horreur, qu'il revoyait de la bonte dans son sourire, et que le desir de l'enlever",4.221880583746528,1.7535120547366931,0.32447427696725867,0.08340452060167455,4.494411571334648,4.0,2.6065969131589766,32.361702127659576,28.0,24.763928409972657,1.3063773833004602,1.0,0.6328858272521286,1521,572,0.37606837606837606,8215,47,25.98347242486462,192521259755.52634,100902127.75446872,0.6785939781643127,0.6666529837581846,63.46834571320663,12.44631695273267,11.251003206892314,15.443037195574021,15.919529564815981,9.712478632478632,52.545791542518224,6.531914893617022,True,59.0,0.8836477987421384,4.305555555555555,1908.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004455696202531645,0.0028354430379746837,0.0,0.14570230607966456,70,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"a tout autre, n'etait plus ajoute par la jalousie a son amour, cet amour redevenait surtout un gout pour les sensations que lui donnait la personne d'Odette, pour le plaisir qu'il avait a admirer comme un spectacle ou a interroger comme un phenomene, le lever d'un de ses regards, la formation d'un de ses sourires, l'emission d'une intonation de sa voix. Et ce plaisir different de tous les autres, avait fini par creer en lui un besoin d'elle et qu'elle seule pouvait assouvir par sa presence ou ses lettres, presque aussi desinteresse, presque aussi artistique, aussi pervers, qu'un autre besoin qui caracterisait cette periode nouvelle de la vie de Swann ou a la secheresse, a la depression des annees anterieures avait succede une sorte de trop-plein spirituel, sans qu'il sut davantage a quoi il devait cet enrichissement inespere de sa vie interieure qu'une personne de sante delicate qui a partir d'un certain moment se fortifie, engraisse, et semble pendant quelque temps s'acheminer vers une complete guerison--cet autre besoin qui se developpait aussi en dehors du monde reel, c'etait celui d'entendre, de connaitre de la musique. Ainsi, par le chimisme meme de son mal, apres qu'il avait fait de la jalousie avec son amour, il recommencait a fabriquer de la tendresse, de la pitie pour Odette. Elle etait redevenue l'Odette charmante et bonne. Il avait des remords d'avoir ete dur pour elle. Il voulait qu'elle vint pres de lui et, auparavant, il voulait lui avoir procure quelque plaisir, pour voir la reconnaissance petrir son visage et modeler son sourire. Aussi Odette, sure de le voir venir apres quelques jours, aussi tendre et soumis qu'avant, lui demander une reconciliation, prenait-elle l'habitude de ne plus craindre de lui deplaire et meme de l'irriter et lui refusait-elle, quand cela lui etait commode, les faveurs auxquelles il tenait le plus. Peut-etre ne savait-elle pas combien il avait ete sincere vis-a-vis d'elle pendant la brouille, quand il lui avait dit qu'il ne lui enverrait pas d'argent et chercherait a lui faire du mal. Peut-etre ne savait-elle pas davantage combien il l'etait, vis-a-vis sinon d'elle, du moins de lui-meme, en d'autres cas ou dans l'interet de l'avenir de leur liaison, pour montrer a Odette qu'il etait capable de se passer d'elle, qu'une rupture restait toujours possible, il decidait de rester quelque temps sans aller chez elle. Parfois c'etait apres quelques jours ou elle ne lui avait pas cause de souci nouveau; et comme, des visites prochaines qu'il lui ferait, il savait qu'il ne pouvait tirer nulle bien grande joie mais plus probablement quelque chagrin qui mettrait fin au calme ou il se trouvait, il lui ecrivait qu'etant tres occupe il ne pourrait la voir aucun des jours qu'il lui avait dit. Or une lettre d'elle, se croisant avec la sienne, le priait precisement de deplacer un rendez-vous. Il se demandait pourquoi; ses soupcons, sa douleur le reprenaient. Il ne pouvait plus tenir, dans l'etat nouveau d'agitation ou il se trouvait, l'engagement qu'il avait pris dans l'etat anterieur de calme relatif, il courait chez elle et exigeait de la voir tous les jours suivants. Et meme si elle ne lui avait pas ecrit la premiere, si elle repondait seulement, cela suffisait pour qu'il ne put plus rester sans la voir. Car, contrairement au calcul de Swann, le consentement d'Odette avait tout change en lui. Comme tous ceux qui possedent une chose, pour savoir ce qui arriverait s'il cessait un moment de la posseder, il avait ote cette chose de son esprit, en y laissant tout le reste dans le meme etat que quand elle etait la. Or l'absence d'une chose, ce n'est pas que cela, ce n'est pas un simple manque partiel, c'est un bouleversement de tout le reste, c'est un etat nouveau qu'on ne peut prevoir dans l'ancien. Mais d'autres fois au contraire,--Odette etait sur le point de partir en voyage,--c'etait apres quelque petite querelle dont il choisissait le pretexte, qu'il se resolvait a ne pas lui ecrire et a ne pas la revoir avant son retour, donnant ainsi les apparences, et demandant le benefice d'une grande brouille, qu'elle croirait peut-etre definitive, a une separation dont la plus longue part etait inevitable du fait du voyage et qu'il faisait commencer seulement un peu plus tot. Deja il se figurait Odette inquiete, affligee, de n'avoir recu ni visite ni lettre et cette image, en calmant sa jalousie, lui rendait facile de se deshabituer de la voir. Sans doute, par moments, tout au bout de son esprit ou sa resolution la refoulait grace a toute la longueur interposee des trois semaines de separation acceptee, c'etait avec plaisir qu'il considerait l'idee qu'il reverrait Odette a son retour: mais c'etait aussi avec si peu d'impatience qu'il commencait a se demander s'il ne doublerait pas volontairement la duree d'une abstinence si facile. Elle ne datait encore que de trois jours, temps beaucoup moins long que celui qu'il avait souvent passe en ne voyant pas Odette, et sans l'avoir comme maintenant premedite. Et pourtant voici qu'une legere contrariete ou un malaise physique,--en l'incitant a considerer le moment present comme un moment exceptionnel, en dehors de la regle, ou la sagesse meme admettrait d'accueillir l'apaisement qu'apporte un plaisir et de donner conge, jusqu'a la reprise utile de l'effort, a la volonte--suspendait l'action de celle-ci qui cessait d'exercer sa compression; ou, moins que cela, le souvenir d'un renseignement qu'il avait oublie de demander a Odette, si elle avait decide la couleur dont elle voulait faire repeindre sa voiture, ou pour une certaine valeur de bourse, si c'etait des actions ordinaires ou privilegiees qu'elle desirait acquerir (c'etait tres joli de lui montrer qu'il pouvait rester sans la voir, mais si apres ca la peinture etait a refaire ou si les actions ne donnaient pas de dividende, il serait bien avance), voici que comme un caoutchouc tendu qu'on lache ou comme l'air dans une machine pneumatique qu'on entr'ouvre, l'idee de la revoir, des lointains ou elle etait maintenue, revenait d'un bond dans le champ du present et des possibilites immediates. Elle y revenait sans plus trouver de resistance, et d'ailleurs si irresistible que Swann avait eu bien moins de peine a sentir s'approcher un a un les quinze jours qu'il devait rester separe d'Odette, qu'il n'en avait a attendre les dix minutes que son cocher mettait pour atteler la voiture qui allait l'emmener chez elle et qu'il passait dans des transports d'impatience et de joie ou il ressaisissait mille fois pour lui prodiguer sa tendresse cette idee de la retrouver qui, par un retour si brusque, au moment ou il la croyait si loin, etait de nouveau pres de lui dans sa plus proche conscience. C'est qu'elle ne trouvait plus pour lui faire obstacle le desir de chercher sans plus tarder a lui resister qui n'existait plus chez Swann depuis que s'etant prouve a lui-meme,--il le croyait du moins,--qu'il en etait si aisement capable, il ne voyait plus aucun inconvenient a ajourner un essai de separation qu'il etait certain maintenant de mettre a execution des qu'il le voudrait. C'est aussi que cette idee de la revoir revenait paree pour lui d'une nouveaute, d'une seduction, douee d'une virulence que l'habitude avait emoussees, mais qui s'etaient retrempees dans cette privation non de trois jours mais de quinze (car la duree d'un renoncement doit se calculer, par anticipation, sur le terme assigne), et de ce qui jusque-la eut ete un plaisir attendu qu'on sacrifie aisement, avait fait un bonheur inespere contre lequel on est sans force. C'est enfin qu'elle y revenait embellie par l'ignorance ou etait Swann de ce qu'Odette avait pu penser, faire peut-etre en voyant qu'il ne lui avait pas donne signe de vie, si bien que ce qu'il allait trouver c'etait la revelation passionnante d'une Odette presque inconnue. Mais elle, de meme qu'elle avait cru que son refus d'argent n'etait qu'une feinte, ne voyait qu'un pretexte dans le renseignement que Swann venait lui demander, sur la voiture a repeindre, ou la valeur a acheter. Car elle ne reconstituait pas les diverses phases de ces crises qu'il traversait et dans l'idee qu'elle s'en faisait, elle omettait d'en comprendre le mecanisme, ne croyant qu'a ce qu'elle connaissait d'avance, a la necessaire, a l'infaillible et toujours identique terminaison. Idee incomplete,--d'autant plus profonde peut-etre--si on la jugeait du point de vue de Swann qui eut sans doute trouve qu'il etait incompris d'Odette, comme un morphinomane ou un tuberculeux, persuades qu'ils ont ete arretes, l'un par un evenement exterieur au moment ou il allait se delivrer de son habitude inveteree, l'autre par une indisposition accidentelle au moment ou il allait etre enfin retabli, se sentent incompris du medecin qui n'attache pas la meme importance qu'eux a ces pretendues contingences, simples deguisements, selon lui, revetus, pour redevenir sensibles a ses malades, par le vice et l'etat morbide qui, en realite, n'ont pas cesse de peser incurablement sur eux tandis qu'ils bercaient des reves de sagesse ou de guerison. Et de fait, l'amour de Swann en etait arrive a ce degre ou le medecin et, dans certaines affections, le chirurgien le plus audacieux, se demandent si priver un malade de son vice ou lui oter son mal, est encore raisonnable ou meme possible. Certes l'etendue de cet amour, Swann n'en avait pas une conscience directe. Quand il cherchait a le mesurer, il lui arrivait parfois qu'il semblat diminue, presque reduit a rien; par exemple, le peu de gout, presque le degout que lui avaient inspire, avant qu'il aimat Odette, ses traits expressifs, son teint sans fraicheur, lui revenait a certains jours. Vraiment il y a progres sensible, se disait-il le lendemain; a voir exactement les choses, je n'avais presque aucun plaisir hier a etre dans son lit, c'est curieux je la trouvais meme laide. Et certes, il etait sincere, mais son amour s'etendait bien au-dela des regions du desir physique. La personne meme d'Odette n'y tenait plus une grande place.

"le voir, il avait peine a identifier la figure de chair ou de bristol avec le trouble douloureux et constant qui habitait en lui. Il se disait presque avec etonnement: C'est elle comme si tout d'un coup on nous montrait exteriorisee devant nous une de nos maladies et que nous ne la trouvions pas ressemblante a ce que nous souffrons. Elle, il essayait de se demander ce que c'etait; car c'est une ressemblance de l'amour et de la mort, plutot que celles si vagues, que l'on redit toujours, de nous faire interroger plus avant, dans la peur que sa realite se derobe, le mystere de la personnalite. Et cette maladie qu'etait l'amour de Swann avait tellement multiplie, il etait si etroitement mele a toutes les habitudes de Swann, a tous ses actes, a sa pensee, a sa sante, a son sommeil, a sa vie, meme a ce qu'il desirait pour apres sa mort, il ne faisait tellement plus qu'un avec lui, qu'on n'aurait pas pu l'arracher de lui sans le detruire lui-meme a peu pres tout entier: comme on dit en chirurgie, son amour n'etait plus operable. Par cet amour Swann avait ete tellement detache de tous les interets, que quand par hasard il retournait dans le monde en se disant que ses relations comme une monture elegante qu'elle n'aurait pas d'ailleurs su estimer tres exactement, pouvaient lui rendre a lui-meme un peu de prix aux yeux d'Odette (et c'aurait peut-etre ete vrai en effet si elles n'avaient ete avilies par cet amour meme, qui pour Odette depreciait toutes les choses qu'il touchait par le fait qu'il semblait les proclamer moins precieuses), il y eprouvait, a cote de la detresse d'etre dans des lieux, au milieu de gens qu'elle ne connaissait pas, le plaisir desinteresse qu'il aurait pris a un roman ou a un tableau ou sont peints les divertissements d'une classe oisive, comme, chez lui, il se complaisait a considerer le fonctionnement de sa vie domestique, l'elegance de sa garde-robe et de sa livree, le bon placement de ses valeurs, de la meme facon qu'a lire dans Saint-Simon, qui etait un de ses auteurs favoris, la mecanique des journees, le menu des repas de Mme de Maintenon, ou l'avarice avisee et le grand train de Lulli. Et dans la faible mesure ou ce detachement n'etait pas absolu, la raison de ce plaisir nouveau que goutait Swann, c'etait de pouvoir emigrer un moment dans les rares parties de lui-meme restees presque etrangeres a son amour, a son chagrin. A cet egard cette personnalite, que lui attribuait ma grand'tante, de fils Swann, distincte de sa personnalite plus individuelle de Charles Swann, etait celle ou il se plaisait maintenant le mieux. Un jour que, pour l'anniversaire de la princesse de Parme (et parce qu'elle pouvait souvent etre indirectement agreable a Odette en lui faisant avoir des places pour des galas, des jubiles), il avait voulu lui envoyer des fruits, ne sachant pas trop comment les commander, il en avait charge une cousine de sa mere qui, ravie de faire une commission pour lui, lui avait ecrit, en lui rendant compte qu'elle n'avait pas pris tous les fruits au meme endroit, mais les raisins chez Crapote dont c'est la specialite, les fraises chez Jauret, les poires chez Chevet ou elles etaient plus belles, etc., chaque fruit visite et examine un par un par moi. Et en effet, par les remerciements de la princesse, il avait pu juger du parfum des fraises et du moelleux des poires. Mais surtout le chaque fruit visite et examine un par un par moi avait ete un apaisement a sa souffrance, en emmenant sa conscience dans une region ou il se rendait rarement, bien qu'elle lui appartint comme heritier d'une famille de riche et bonne bourgeoisie ou s'etaient conserves hereditairement, tout prets a etre mis a son service des qu'il le souhaitait, la connaissance des bonnes adresses et l'art de savoir bien faire une commande. Certes, il avait trop longtemps oublie qu'il etait le fils Swann pour ne pas ressentir quand il le redevenait un moment, un plaisir plus vif que ceux qu'il eut pu eprouver le reste du temps et sur lesquels il etait blase; et si l'amabilite des bourgeois, pour lesquels il restait surtout cela, etait moins vive que celle de l'aristocratie (mais plus flatteuse d'ailleurs, car chez eux du moins elle ne se separe jamais de la consideration), une lettre d'altesse, quelques divertissements princiers qu'elle lui proposat, ne pouvait lui etre aussi agreable que celle qui lui demandait d'etre temoin, ou seulement d'assister a un mariage dans la famille de vieux amis de ses parents dont les uns avaient continue a le voir--comme mon grand-pere qui, l'annee precedente, l'avait invite au mariage de ma mere--et dont certains autres le connaissaient personnellement a peine mais se croyaient des devoirs de politesse envers le fils, envers le digne successeur de feu M. Swann. Mais, par les intimites deja anciennes qu'il avait parmi eux, les gens du monde, dans une certaine mesure, faisaient aussi partie de sa maison, de son domestique et de sa famille. Il se sentait, a considerer ses brillantes amities, le meme appui hors de lui-meme, le meme confort, qu'a regarder les belles terres, la belle argenterie, le beau linge de table, qui lui venaient des siens. Et la pensee que s'il tombait chez lui frappe d'une attaque ce serait tout naturellement le duc de Chartres, le prince de Reuss, le duc de Luxembourg et le baron de Charlus, que son valet de chambre courrait chercher, lui apportait la meme consolation qu'a notre vieille Francoise de savoir qu'elle serait ensevelie dans des draps fins a elle, marques, non reprises (ou si finement que cela ne donnait qu'une plus haute idee du soin de l'ouvriere), linceul de l'image frequente duquel elle tirait une certaine satisfaction, sinon de bien-etre, au moins d'amour-propre. Mais surtout, comme dans toutes celles de ses actions, et de ses pensees qui se rapportaient a Odette, Swann etait constamment domine et dirige par le sentiment inavoue qu'il lui etait peut-etre pas moins cher, mais moins agreable a voir que quiconque, que le plus ennuyeux fidele des Verdurin, quand il se reportait a un monde pour qui il etait l'homme exquis par excellence, qu'on faisait tout pour attirer, qu'on se desolait de ne pas voir, il recommencait a croire a l'existence d'une vie plus heureuse, presque a en eprouver l'appetit, comme il arrive a un malade alite depuis des mois, a la diete, et qui apercoit dans un journal le menu d'un dejeuner officiel ou l'annonce d'une croisiere en Sicile. S'il etait oblige de donner des excuses aux gens du monde pour ne pas leur faire de visites, c'etait de lui en faire qu'il cherchait a s'excuser aupres d'Odette. Encore les payait-il (se demandant a la fin du mois, pour peu qu'il eut un peu abuse de sa patience et fut alle souvent la voir, si c'etait assez de lui envoyer quatre mille francs), et pour chacune trouvait un pretexte, un present a lui apporter, un renseignement dont elle avait besoin, M. de Charlus qu'elle avait rencontre allant chez elle, et qui avait exige qu'il l'accompagnat. Et a defaut d'aucun, il priait M. de Charlus de courir chez elle, de lui dire comme spontanement, au cours de la conversation, qu'il se rappelait avoir a parler a Swann, qu'elle voulut bien lui faire demander de passer tout de suite chez elle; mais le plus souvent Swann attendait en vain et M. de Charlus lui disait le soir que son moyen n'avait pas reussi. De sorte que si elle faisait maintenant de frequentes absences, meme a Paris, quand elle y restait, elle le voyait peu, et elle qui, quand elle l'aimait, lui disait: Je suis toujours libre et Qu'est-ce que l'opinion des autres peut me faire? , maintenant, chaque fois qu'il voulait la voir, elle invoquait les convenances ou pretextait des occupations. Quand il parlait d'aller a une fete de charite, a un vernissage, a une premiere, ou elle serait, elle lui disait qu'il voulait afficher leur liaison, qu'il la traitait comme une fille. C'est au point que pour tacher de n'etre pas partout prive de la rencontrer, Swann qui savait qu'elle connaissait et affectionnait beaucoup mon grand-oncle Adolphe dont il avait ete lui-meme l'ami, alla le voir un jour dans son petit appartement de la rue de Bellechasse afin de lui demander d'user de son influence sur Odette. Comme elle prenait toujours, quand elle parlait a Swann, de mon oncle, des airs poetiques, disant: Ah! lui, ce n'est pas comme toi, c'est une si belle chose, si grande, si jolie, que son amitie pour moi. Ce n'est pas lui qui me considererait assez peu pour vouloir se montrer avec moi dans tous les lieux publics, Swann fut embarrasse et ne savait pas a quel ton il devait se hausser pour parler d'elle a mon oncle. Il posa d'abord l'excellence a priori d'Odette, l'axiome de sa supra-humanite seraphique, la revelation de ses vertus indemontrables et dont la notion ne pouvait deriver de l'experience. Je veux parler avec vous. Vous, vous savez quelle femme au-dessus de toutes les femmes, quel etre adorable, quel ange est Odette. Mais vous savez ce que c'est que la vie de Paris. Tout le monde ne connait pas Odette sous le jour ou nous la connaissons vous et moi. Alors il y a des gens qui trouvent que je joue un role un peu ridicule; elle ne peut meme pas admettre que je la rencontre dehors, au theatre. Vous, en qui elle a tant de confiance, ne pourriez-vous lui dire quelques mots pour moi, lui assurer qu'elle s'exagere le tort qu'un salut de moi lui cause? Mon oncle conseilla a Swann de rester un peu sans voir Odette qui ne l'en aimerait que plus, et a Odette de laisser Swann la retrouver partout ou cela lui plairait. Quelques jours apres, Odette disait a Swann qu'elle venait d'avoir une deception en voyant que mon",4.556643506620701,1.6729420273408429,0.3287585744266252,0.07535065154518425,4.427753023551878,4.0,2.587310507847589,41.3421052631579,29.5,35.15999245238937,1.2902609802673457,1.0,0.6470030764244226,1571,594,0.3781031190324634,7972,38,26.951577049876487,506898716252.929,264837364.81344253,0.8208444337989833,0.8024019091907475,55.71668422727731,15.758500619786261,12.488612386084178,19.13391403397099,20.095769372508293,9.519210693825585,61.39302824215217,8.289473684210526,True,64.0,0.8808777429467085,4.165099268547545,1914.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009966777408637873,0.009966777408637873,0.009966777408637873,0.009966777408637873,0.009966777408637873,0.009966777408637873,0.0049833887043189366,0.004152823920265781,0.0,0.10606060606060606,72,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"tous cas il n'etait pas avec lui de l'exactitude et de la deference qu'elle voulait. Elle sentait qu'il desirait lui entendre dire: Ne le prends plus pour venir chez moi, comme il aurait desire un baiser. Comme elle etait de bonne humeur, elle le lui dit; il fut attendri. Le soir, causant avec M. de Charlus avec qui il avait la douceur de pouvoir parler d'elle ouvertement (car les moindres propos qu'il tenait, meme aux personnes qui ne la connaissaient pas, se rapportaient en quelque maniere a elle), il lui dit: --Je crois pourtant qu'elle m'aime; elle est si gentille pour moi, ce que je fais ne lui est certainement pas indifferent. Et si, au moment d'aller chez elle, montant dans sa voiture avec un ami qu'il devait laisser en route, l'autre lui disait: --Tiens, ce n'est pas Loredan qui est sur le siege? , avec quelle joie melancolique Swann lui repondait: --Oh! sapristi non! je te dirai, je ne peux pas prendre Loredan quand je vais rue La Perouse. Odette n'aime pas que je prenne Loredan, elle ne le trouve pas bien pour moi; enfin que veux-tu, les femmes, tu sais! je sais que ca lui deplairait beaucoup. Ah bien oui! je n'aurais eu qu'a prendre Remi! j'en aurais eu une histoire! Ces nouvelles facons indifferentes, distraites, irritables, qui etaient maintenant celles d'Odette avec lui, certes Swann en souffrait; mais il ne connaissait pas sa souffrance; comme c'etait progressivement, jour par jour, qu'Odette s'etait refroidie a son egard, ce n'est qu'en mettant en regard de ce qu'elle etait aujourd'hui ce qu'elle avait ete au debut, qu'il aurait pu sonder la profondeur du changement qui s'etait accompli. Or ce changement c'etait sa profonde, sa secrete blessure, qui lui faisait mal jour et nuit, et des qu'il sentait que ses pensees allaient un peu trop pres d'elle, vivement il les dirigeait d'un autre cote de peur de trop souffrir. Il se disait bien d'une facon abstraite: Il fut un temps ou Odette m'aimait davantage, mais jamais il ne revoyait ce temps. De meme qu'il y avait dans son cabinet une commode qu'il s'arrangeait a ne pas regarder, qu'il faisait un crochet pour eviter en entrant et en sortant, parce que dans un tiroir etaient serres le chrysantheme qu'elle lui avait donne le premier soir ou il l'avait reconduite, les lettres ou elle disait: Que n'y avez-vous oublie aussi votre cur, je ne vous aurais pas laisse le reprendre et: A quelque heure du jour et de la nuit que vous ayez besoin de moi, faites-moi signe et disposez de ma vie, de meme il y avait en lui une place dont il ne laissait jamais approcher son esprit, lui faisant faire s'il le fallait le detour d'un long raisonnement pour qu'il n'eut pas a passer devant elle: c'etait celle ou vivait le souvenir des jours heureux. Mais sa si precautionneuse prudence fut dejouee un soir qu'il etait alle dans le monde. C'etait chez la marquise de Saint-Euverte, a la derniere, pour cette annee-la, des soirees ou elle faisait entendre des artistes qui lui servaient ensuite pour ses concerts de charite. Swann, qui avait voulu successivement aller a toutes les precedentes et n'avait pu s'y resoudre, avait recu, tandis qu'il s'habillait pour se rendre a celle-ci, la visite du baron de Charlus qui venait lui offrir de retourner avec lui chez la marquise, si sa compagnie devait l'aider a s'y ennuyer un peu moins, a s'y trouver moins triste. Mais Swann lui avait repondu: --Vous ne doutez pas du plaisir que j'aurais a etre avec vous. Mais le plus grand plaisir que vous puissiez me faire c'est d'aller plutot voir Odette. Vous savez l'excellente influence que vous avez sur elle. Je crois qu'elle ne sort pas ce soir avant d'aller chez son ancienne couturiere ou du reste elle sera surement contente que vous l'accompagniez. En tous cas vous la trouveriez chez elle avant. Tachez de la distraire et aussi de lui parler raison. Si vous pouviez arranger quelque chose pour demain qui lui plaise et que nous pourrions faire tous les trois ensemble. Tachez aussi de poser des jalons pour cet ete, si elle avait envie de quelque chose, d'une croisiere que nous ferions tous les trois, que sais-je? Quant a ce soir, je ne compte pas la voir; maintenant si elle le desirait ou si vous trouviez un joint, vous n'avez qu'a m'envoyer un mot chez Mme de Saint-Euverte jusqu'a minuit, et apres chez moi. Merci de tout ce que vous faites pour moi, vous savez comme je vous aime. Le baron lui promit d'aller faire la visite qu'il desirait apres qu'il l'aurait conduit jusqu'a la porte de l'hotel Saint-Euverte, ou Swann arriva tranquillise par la pensee que M. de Charlus passerait la soiree rue La Perouse, mais dans un etat de melancolique indifference a toutes les choses qui ne touchaient pas Odette, et en particulier aux choses mondaines, qui leur donnait le charme de ce qui, n'etant plus un but pour notre volonte, nous apparait en soi-meme. Des sa descente de voiture, au premier plan de ce resume fictif de leur vie domestique que les maitresses de maison pretendent offrir a leurs invites les jours de ceremonie et ou elles cherchent a respecter la verite du costume et celle du decor, Swann prit plaisir a voir les heritiers des tigres de Balzac, les grooms, suivants ordinaires de la promenade, qui, chapeautes et bottes, restaient dehors devant l'hotel sur le sol de l'avenue, ou devant les ecuries, comme des jardiniers auraient ete ranges a l'entree de leurs parterres. La disposition particuliere qu'il avait toujours eue a chercher des analogies entre les etres vivants et les portraits des musees s'exercait encore mais d'une facon plus constante et plus generale; c'est la vie mondaine tout entiere, maintenant qu'il en etait detache, qui se presentait a lui comme une suite de tableaux. Dans le vestibule ou, autrefois, quand il etait un mondain, il entrait enveloppe dans son pardessus pour en sortir en frac, mais sans savoir ce qui s'y etait passe, etant par la pensee, pendant les quelques instants qu'il y sejournait, ou bien encore dans la fete qu'il venait de quitter, ou bien deja dans la fete ou on allait l'introduire, pour la premiere fois il remarqua, reveillee par l'arrivee inopinee d'un invite aussi tardif, la meute eparse, magnifique et desuvree de grands valets de pied qui dormaient ca et la sur des banquettes et des coffres et qui, soulevant leurs nobles profils aigus de levriers, se dresserent et, rassembles, formerent le cercle autour de lui. L'un d'eux, d'aspect particulierement feroce et assez semblable a l'executeur dans certains tableaux de la Renaissance qui figurent des supplices, s'avanca vers lui d'un air implacable pour lui prendre ses affaires. Mais la durete de son regard d'acier etait compensee par la douceur de ses gants de fil, si bien qu'en approchant de Swann il semblait temoigner du mepris pour sa personne et des egards pour son chapeau. Il le prit avec un soin auquel l'exactitude de sa pointure donnait quelque chose de meticuleux et une delicatesse que rendait presque touchante l'appareil de sa force. Puis il le passa a un de ses aides, nouveau, et timide, qui exprimait l'effroi qu'il ressentait en roulant en tous sens des regards furieux et montrait l'agitation d'une bete captive dans les premieres heures de sa domesticite. A quelques pas, un grand gaillard en livree revait, immobile, sculptural, inutile, comme ce guerrier purement decoratif qu'on voit dans les tableaux les plus tumultueux de Mantegna, songer, appuye sur son bouclier, tandis qu'on se precipite et qu'on s'egorge a cote de lui; detache du groupe de ses camarades qui s'empressaient autour de Swann, il semblait aussi resolu a se desinteresser de cette scene, qu'il suivait vaguement de ses yeux glauques et cruels, que si c'eut ete le massacre des Innocents ou le martyre de saint Jacques. Il semblait precisement appartenir a cette race disparue--ou qui peut-etre n'exista jamais que dans le retable de San Zeno et les fresques des Eremitani ou Swann l'avait approchee et ou elle reve encore--issue de la fecondation d'une statue antique par quelque modele padouan du Maitre ou quelque saxon d'Albert Durer. Et les meches de ses cheveux roux crespeles par la nature, mais colles par la brillantine, etaient largement traitees comme elles sont dans la sculpture grecque qu'etudiait sans cesse le peintre de Mantoue, et qui, si dans la creation elle ne figure que l'homme, sait du moins tirer de ses simples formes des richesses si variees et comme empruntees a toute la nature vivante, qu'une chevelure, par l'enroulement lisse et les becs aigus de ses boucles, ou dans la superposition du triple et fleurissant diademe de ses tresses, a l'air a la fois d'un paquet d'algues, d'une nichee de colombes, d'un bandeau de jacinthes et d'une torsade de serpent. D'autres encore, colossaux aussi, se tenaient sur les degres d'un escalier monumental que leur presence decorative et leur immobilite marmoreenne auraient pu faire nommer comme celui du Palais Ducal: l'Escalier des Geants et dans lequel Swann s'engagea avec la tristesse de penser qu'Odette ne l'avait jamais gravi. Ah! avec quelle joie au contraire il eut grimpe les etages noirs, mal odorants et casse-cou de la petite couturiere retiree, dans le cinquieme de laquelle il aurait ete si heureux de payer plus cher qu'une avant-scene hebdomadaire a l'Opera le droit de passer la soiree quand Odette y venait et meme les autres jours pour pouvoir parler d'elle, vivre avec les gens qu'elle avait l'habitude de voir quand il n'etait pas la et qui a cause de cela lui paraissaient receler, de la vie de sa maitresse, quelque chose de plus reel, de plus inaccessible et de plus mysterieux. Tandis que dans cet escalier pestilentiel et desire de l'ancienne couturiere, comme il n'y en avait pas un second pour le service, on voyait le soir devant chaque porte une boite au lait vide et sale preparee sur le paillasson, dans l'escalier",4.627094366909495,1.7992462902343074,0.30979058090301376,0.07334736439629957,4.576348278102664,4.0,2.57616645007799,34.97727272727273,27.0,28.80221632599228,1.299545159194282,1.0,0.6321008226856848,1539,640,0.4158544509421702,8169,44,21.912645911261258,3285044092.8085413,1748293.8226761795,0.8460269362427467,0.8323114216327667,61.39154771398195,13.385769242128891,11.344700141305452,16.356081280642684,17.613236753499912,10.262664067576345,57.19949494949495,7.7727272727272725,True,38.0,0.8919638105375199,4.347525279403938,1879.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004069589988808627,0.0021365347441245296,0.0,0.14582224587546566,75,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"oncle etait pareil a tous les hommes: il venait d'essayer de la prendre de force. Elle calma Swann qui au premier moment voulait aller provoquer mon oncle, mais il refusa de lui serrer la main quand il le rencontra. Il regretta d'autant plus cette brouille avec mon oncle Adolphe qu'il avait espere, s'il l'avait revu quelquefois et avait pu causer en toute confiance avec lui, tacher de tirer au clair certains bruits relatifs a la vie qu'Odette avait menee autrefois a Nice. Or mon oncle Adolphe y passait l'hiver. Et Swann pensait que c'etait meme peut-etre la qu'il avait connu Odette. Le peu qui avait echappe a quelqu'un devant lui, relativement a un homme qui aurait ete l'amant d'Odette avait bouleverse Swann. Mais les choses qu'il aurait avant de les connaitre, trouve le plus affreux d'apprendre et le plus impossible de croire, une fois qu'il les savait, elles etaient incorporees a tout jamais a sa tristesse, il les admettait, il n'aurait plus pu comprendre qu'elles n'eussent pas ete. Seulement chacune operait sur l'idee qu'il se faisait de sa maitresse une retouche ineffacable. Il crut meme comprendre, une fois, que cette legerete des murs d'Odette qu'il n'eut pas soupconnee, etait assez connue, et qu'a Bade et a Nice, quand elle y passait jadis plusieurs mois, elle avait eu une sorte de notoriete galante. Il chercha, pour les interroger, a se rapprocher de certains viveurs; mais ceux-ci savaient qu'il connaissait Odette; et puis il avait peur de les faire penser de nouveau a elle, de les mettre sur ses traces. Mais lui a qui jusque-la rien n'aurait pu paraitre aussi fastidieux que tout ce qui se rapportait a la vie cosmopolite de Bade ou de Nice, apprenant qu'Odette avait peut-etre fait autrefois la fete dans ces villes de plaisir, sans qu'il dut jamais arriver a savoir si c'etait seulement pour satisfaire a des besoins d'argent que grace a lui elle n'avait plus, ou a des caprices qui pouvaient renaitre, maintenant il se penchait avec une angoisse impuissante, aveugle et vertigineuse vers l'abime sans fond ou etaient allees s'engloutir ces annees du debut du Septennat pendant lesquelles on passait l'hiver sur la promenade des Anglais, l'ete sous les tilleuls de Bade, et il leur trouvait une profondeur douloureuse mais magnifique comme celle que leur eut pretee un poete; et il eut mis a reconstituer les petits faits de la chronique de la Cote d'Azur d'alors, si elle avait pu l'aider a comprendre quelque chose du sourire ou des regards--pourtant si honnetes et si simples--d'Odette, plus de passion que l'estheticien qui interroge les documents subsistant de la Florence du XVe siecle pour tacher d'entrer plus avant dans l'ame de la Primavera, de la bella Vanna, ou de la Venus, de Botticelli. Souvent sans lui rien dire il la regardait, il songeait; elle lui disait: Comme tu as l'air triste! Il n'y avait pas bien longtemps encore, de l'idee qu'elle etait une creature bonne, analogue aux meilleures qu'il eut connues, il avait passe a l'idee qu'elle etait une femme entretenue; inversement il lui etait arrive depuis de revenir de l'Odette de Crecy, peut-etre trop connue des fetards, des hommes a femmes, a ce visage d'une expression parfois si douce, a cette nature si humaine. Il se disait: Qu'est-ce que cela veut dire qu'a Nice tout le monde sache qui est Odette de Crecy? Ces reputations-la, meme vraies, sont faites avec les idees des autres; il pensait que cette legende--fut-elle authentique--etait exterieure a Odette, n'etait pas en elle comme une personnalite irreductible et malfaisante; que la creature qui avait pu etre amenee a mal faire, c'etait une femme aux bons yeux, au cur plein de pitie pour la souffrance, au corps docile qu'il avait tenu, qu'il avait serre dans ses bras et manie, une femme qu'il pourrait arriver un jour a posseder toute, s'il reussissait a se rendre indispensable a elle. Elle etait la, souvent fatiguee, le visage vide pour un instant de la preoccupation febrile et joyeuse des choses inconnues qui faisaient souffrir Swann; elle ecartait ses cheveux avec ses mains; son front, sa figure paraissaient plus larges; alors, tout d'un coup, quelque pensee simplement humaine, quelque bon sentiment comme il en existe dans toutes les creatures, quand dans un moment de repos ou de repliement elles sont livrees a elles-memes, jaillissait dans ses yeux comme un rayon jaune. Et aussitot tout son visage s'eclairait comme une campagne grise, couverte de nuages qui soudain s'ecartent, pour sa transfiguration, au moment du soleil couchant. La vie qui etait en Odette a ce moment-la, l'avenir meme qu'elle semblait reveusement regarder, Swann aurait pu les partager avec elle; aucune agitation mauvaise ne semblait y avoir laisse de residu. Si rares qu'ils devinssent, ces moments-la ne furent pas inutiles. Par le souvenir Swann reliait ces parcelles, abolissait les intervalles, coulait comme en or une Odette de bonte et de calme pour laquelle il fit plus tard (comme on le verra dans la deuxieme partie de cet ouvrage) des sacrifices que l'autre Odette n'eut pas obtenus. Mais que ces moments etaient rares, et que maintenant il la voyait peu! Meme pour leur rendez-vous du soir, elle ne lui disait qu'a la derniere minute si elle pourrait le lui accorder car, comptant qu'elle le trouverait toujours libre, elle voulait d'abord etre certaine que personne d'autre ne lui proposerait de venir. Elle alleguait qu'elle etait obligee d'attendre une reponse de la plus haute importance pour elle, et meme si apres qu'elle avait fait venir Swann des amis demandaient a Odette, quand la soiree etait deja commencee, de les rejoindre au theatre ou a souper, elle faisait un bond joyeux et s'habillait a la hate. Au fur et a mesure qu'elle avancait dans sa toilette, chaque mouvement qu'elle faisait rapprochait Swann du moment ou il faudrait la quitter, ou elle s'enfuirait d'un elan irresistible; et quand, enfin prete, plongeant une derniere fois dans son miroir ses regards tendus et eclaires par l'attention, elle remettait un peu de rouge a ses levres, fixait une meche sur son front et demandait son manteau de soiree bleu ciel avec des glands d'or, Swann avait l'air si triste qu'elle ne pouvait reprimer un geste d'impatience et disait: Voila comme tu me remercies de t'avoir garde jusqu'a la derniere minute. Moi qui croyais avoir fait quelque chose de gentil. C'est bon a savoir pour une autre fois! Parfois, au risque de la facher, il se promettait de chercher a savoir ou elle etait allee, il revait d'une alliance avec Forcheville qui peut-etre aurait pu le renseigner. D'ailleurs quand il savait avec qui elle passait la soiree, il etait bien rare qu'il ne put pas decouvrir dans toutes ses relations a lui quelqu'un qui connaissait fut-ce indirectement l'homme avec qui elle etait sortie et pouvait facilement en obtenir tel ou tel renseignement. Et tandis qu'il ecrivait a un de ses amis pour lui demander de chercher a eclaircir tel ou tel point, il eprouvait le repos de cesser de se poser ses questions sans reponses et de transferer a un autre la fatigue d'interroger. Il est vrai que Swann n'etait guere plus avance quand il avait certains renseignements. Savoir ne permet pas toujours d'empecher, mais du moins les choses que nous savons, nous les tenons, sinon entre nos mains, du moins dans notre pensee ou nous les disposons a notre gre, ce qui nous donne l'illusion d'une sorte de pouvoir sur elles. Il etait heureux toutes les fois ou M. de Charlus etait avec Odette. Entre M. de Charlus et elle, Swann savait qu'il ne pouvait rien se passer, que quand M. de Charlus sortait avec elle c'etait par amitie pour lui et qu'il ne ferait pas difficulte a lui raconter ce qu'elle avait fait. Quelquefois elle avait declare si categoriquement a Swann qu'il lui etait impossible de le voir un certain soir, elle avait l'air de tenir tant a une sortie, que Swann attachait une veritable importance a ce que M. de Charlus fut libre de l'accompagner. Le lendemain, sans oser poser beaucoup de questions a M. de Charlus, il le contraignait, en ayant l'air de ne pas bien comprendre ses premieres reponses, a lui en donner de nouvelles, apres chacune desquelles il se sentait plus soulage, car il apprenait bien vite qu'Odette avait occupe sa soiree aux plaisirs les plus innocents. Mais comment, mon petit Meme, je ne comprends pas bien..., ce n'est pas en sortant de chez elle que vous etes alles au musee Grevin? Vous etiez alles ailleurs d'abord. Oh! que c'est drole! Vous ne savez pas comme vous m'amusez, mon petit Meme. Mais quelle drole d'idee elle a eue d'aller ensuite au Chat Noir, c'est bien une idee d'elle... c'est vous. C'est curieux. Apres tout ce n'est pas une mauvaise idee, elle devait y connaitre beaucoup de monde? elle n'a parle a personne? C'est extraordinaire. Alors vous etes restes la comme cela tous les deux tous seuls? Je vois d'ici cette scene. Vous etes gentil, mon petit Meme, je vous aime bien. Swann se sentait soulage. Pour lui, a qui il etait arrive en causant avec des indifferents qu'il ecoutait a peine, d'entendre quelquefois certaines phrases (celle-ci par exemple: J'ai vu hier Mme de Crecy, elle etait avec un monsieur que je ne connais pas), phrases qui aussitot dans le cur de Swann passaient a l'etat solide, s'y durcissaient comme une incrustation, le dechiraient, n'en bougeaient plus, qu'ils etaient doux au contraire ces mots: Elle ne connaissait personne, elle n'a parle a personne, comme ils circulaient aisement en lui, qu'ils etaient fluides, faciles, respirables! Et pourtant au bout d'un instant il se disait qu'Odette devait le trouver bien ennuyeux pour que ce fussent la les plaisirs qu'elle preferait a sa compagnie. Et leur insignifiance, si elle le rassurait, lui faisait pourtant de la peine comme une trahison. Meme quand il ne pouvait savoir ou elle etait allee, il lui aurait suffi pour calmer l'angoisse qu'il eprouvait alors, et contre laquelle la presence d'Odette, la douceur",3.608279476759082,1.549132653726544,0.37016792970428297,0.10930379542931384,4.625647668393782,4.0,2.5877882248336763,26.16949152542373,18.0,23.460859971214,1.2862694300518134,1.0,0.6272466934580678,1544,593,0.38406735751295334,8279,59,24.89524199733187,64843466667.17527,34146111.98903384,0.7411406502641481,0.7469694039277863,71.45457231931151,9.794080969526654,10.301432327559088,12.877123035039958,13.441546280846573,10.26772020725388,48.060683235268286,5.728813559322034,True,63.0,0.8846761453396524,4.359662980516061,1899.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.01509206157561123,0.010061374383740818,0.006036824630244492,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00553375591105745,0.006539893349431532,0.004829459704195593,0.12796208530805686,73,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"d'etre aupres d'elle etait le seul specifique (un specifique qui a la longue aggravait le mal avec bien des remedes, mais du moins calmait momentanement la souffrance), il lui aurait suffi, si Odette l'avait seulement permis, de rester chez elle tant qu'elle ne serait pas la, de l'attendre jusqu'a cette heure du retour dans l'apaisement de laquelle seraient venues se confondre les heures qu'un prestige, un malefice lui avaient fait croire differentes des autres. Mais elle ne le voulait pas; il revenait chez lui; il se forcait en chemin a former divers projets, il cessait de songer a Odette; meme il arrivait, tout en se deshabillant, a rouler en lui des pensees assez joyeuses; c'est le cur plein de l'espoir d'aller le lendemain voir quelque chef-d'uvre qu'il se mettait au lit et eteignait sa lumiere; mais, des que, pour se preparer a dormir, il cessait d'exercer sur lui-meme une contrainte dont il n'avait meme pas conscience tant elle etait devenue habituelle, au meme instant un frisson glace refluait en lui et il se mettait a sangloter. Il ne voulait meme pas savoir pourquoi, s'essuyait les yeux, se disait en riant: C'est charmant, je deviens nevropathe. Puis il ne pouvait penser sans une grande lassitude que le lendemain il faudrait recommencer de chercher a savoir ce qu'Odette avait fait, a mettre en jeu des influences pour tacher de la voir. Cette necessite d'une activite sans treve, sans variete, sans resultats, lui etait si cruelle qu'un jour apercevant une grosseur sur son ventre, il ressentit une veritable joie a la pensee qu'il avait peut-etre une tumeur mortelle, qu'il n'allait plus avoir a s'occuper de rien, que c'etait la maladie qui allait le gouverner, faire de lui son jouet, jusqu'a la fin prochaine. Et en effet si, a cette epoque, il lui arriva souvent sans se l'avouer de desirer la mort, c'etait pour echapper moins a l'acuite de ses souffrances qu'a la monotonie de son effort. Et pourtant il aurait voulu vivre jusqu'a l'epoque ou il ne l'aimerait plus, ou elle n'aurait aucune raison de lui mentir et ou il pourrait enfin apprendre d'elle si le jour ou il etait alle la voir dans l'apres-midi, elle etait ou non couchee avec Forcheville. Souvent pendant quelques jours, le soupcon qu'elle aimait quelqu'un d'autre le detournait de se poser cette question relative a Forcheville, la lui rendait presque indifferente, comme ces formes nouvelles d'un meme etat maladif qui semblent momentanement nous avoir delivres des precedentes. Meme il y avait des jours ou il n'etait tourmente par aucun soupcon. Il se croyait gueri. Mais le lendemain matin, au reveil, il sentait a la meme place la meme douleur dont, la veille pendant la journee, il avait comme dilue la sensation dans le torrent des impressions differentes. Mais elle n'avait pas bouge de place. Et meme, c'etait l'acuite de cette douleur qui avait reveille Swann. Comme Odette ne lui donnait aucun renseignement sur ces choses si importantes qui l'occupaient tant chaque jour (bien qu'il eut assez vecu pour savoir qu'il n'y en a jamais d'autres que les plaisirs), il ne pouvait pas chercher longtemps de suite a les imaginer, son cerveau fonctionnait a vide; alors il passait son doigt sur ses paupieres fatiguees comme il aurait essuye le verre de son lorgnon, et cessait entierement de penser. Il surnageait pourtant a cet inconnu certaines occupations qui reapparaissaient de temps en temps, vaguement rattachees par elle a quelque obligation envers des parents eloignes ou des amis d'autrefois, qui, parce qu'ils etaient les seuls qu'elle lui citait souvent comme l'empechant de le voir, paraissaient a Swann former le cadre fixe, necessaire, de la vie d'Odette. A cause du ton dont elle lui disait de temps a autre le jour ou je vais avec mon amie a l'Hippodrome, si, s'etant senti malade et ayant pense: peut-etre Odette voudrait bien passer chez moi, il se rappelait brusquement que c'etait justement ce jour-la, il se disait: Ah! non, ce n'est pas la peine de lui demander de venir, j'aurais du y penser plus tot, c'est le jour ou elle va avec son amie a l'Hippodrome. Reservons-nous pour ce qui est possible; c'est inutile de s'user a proposer des choses inacceptables et refusees d'avance. Et ce devoir qui incombait a Odette d'aller a l'Hippodrome et devant lequel Swann s'inclinait ainsi ne lui paraissait pas seulement ineluctable; mais ce caractere de necessite dont il etait empreint semblait rendre plausible et legitime tout ce qui de pres ou de loin se rapportait a lui. Si Odette dans la rue ayant recu d'un passant un salut qui avait eveille la jalousie de Swann, elle repondait aux questions de celui-ci en rattachant l'existence de l'inconnu a un des deux ou trois grands devoirs dont elle lui parlait, si, par exemple, elle disait: C'est un monsieur qui etait dans la loge de mon amie avec qui je vais a l'Hippodrome, cette explication calmait les soupcons de Swann, qui en effet trouvait inevitable que l'amie eut d'autre invites qu'Odette dans sa loge a l'Hippodrome, mais n'avait jamais cherche ou reussi a se les figurer. Ah! comme il eut aime la connaitre, l'amie qui allait a l'Hippodrome, et qu'elle l'y emmenat avec Odette! Comme il aurait donne toutes ses relations pour n'importe quelle personne qu'avait l'habitude de voir Odette, fut-ce une manucure ou une demoiselle de magasin. Il eut fait pour elles plus de frais que pour des reines. Ne lui auraient-elles pas fourni, dans ce qu'elles contenaient de la vie d'Odette, le seul calmant efficace pour ses souffrances? Comme il aurait couru avec joie passer les journees chez telle de ces petites gens avec lesquelles Odette gardait des relations, soit par interet, soit par simplicite veritable. Comme il eut volontiers elu domicile a jamais au cinquieme etage de telle maison sordide et enviee ou Odette ne l'emmenait pas, et ou, s'il y avait habite avec la petite couturiere retiree dont il eut volontiers fait semblant d'etre l'amant, il aurait presque chaque jour recu sa visite. Dans ces quartiers presque populaires, quelle existence modeste, abjecte, mais douce, mais nourrie de calme et de bonheur, il eut accepte de vivre indefiniment. Il arrivait encore parfois, quand, ayant rencontre Swann, elle voyait s'approcher d'elle quelqu'un qu'il ne connaissait pas, qu'il put remarquer sur le visage d'Odette cette tristesse qu'elle avait eue le jour ou il etait venu pour la voir pendant que Forcheville etait la. Mais c'etait rare; car les jours ou malgre tout ce qu'elle avait a faire et la crainte de ce que penserait le monde, elle arrivait a voir Swann, ce qui dominait maintenant dans son attitude etait l'assurance: grand contraste, peut-etre revanche inconsciente ou reaction naturelle de l'emotion craintive qu'aux premiers temps ou elle l'avait connu, elle eprouvait aupres de lui, et meme loin de lui, quand elle commencait une lettre par ces mots: Mon ami, ma main tremble si fort que je peux a peine ecrire (elle le pretendait du moins et un peu de cet emoi devait etre sincere pour qu'elle desirat d'en feindre davantage). Swann lui plaisait alors. On ne tremble jamais que pour soi, que pour ceux qu'on aime. Quand notre bonheur n'est plus dans leurs mains, de quel calme, de quelle aisance, de quelle hardiesse on jouit aupres d'eux! En lui parlant, en lui ecrivant, elle n'avait plus de ces mots par lesquels elle cherchait a se donner l'illusion qu'il lui appartenait, faisant naitre les occasions de dire mon, mien, quand il s'agissait de lui: Vous etes mon bien, c'est le parfum de notre amitie, je le garde, de lui parler de l'avenir, de la mort meme, comme d'une seule chose pour eux deux. Dans ce temps-la, a tout de qu'il disait, elle repondait avec admiration: Vous, vous ne serez jamais comme tout le monde; elle regardait sa longue tete un peu chauve, dont les gens qui connaissaient les succes de Swann pensaient: Il n'est pas regulierement beau si vous voulez, mais il est chic: ce toupet, ce monocle, ce sourire!, et, plus curieuse peut-etre de connaitre ce qu'il etait que desireuse d'etre sa maitresse, elle disait: --Si je pouvais savoir ce qu'il y a dans cette tete la! Maintenant, a toutes les paroles de Swann elle repondait d'un ton parfois irrite, parfois indulgent: --Ah! tu ne seras donc jamais comme tout le monde! Elle regardait cette tete qui n'etait qu'un peu plus vieillie par le souci (mais dont maintenant tous pensaient, en vertu de cette meme aptitude qui permet de decouvrir les intentions d'un morceau symphonique dont on a lu le programme, et les ressemblances d'un enfant quand on connait sa parente: Il n'est pas positivement laid si vous voulez, mais il est ridicule: ce monocle, ce toupet, ce sourire!, realisant dans leur imagination suggestionnee la demarcation immaterielle qui separe a quelques mois de distance une tete d'amant de cur et une tete de cocu), elle disait: --Ah! si je pouvais changer, rendre raisonnable ce qu'il y a dans cette tete-la. Toujours pret a croire ce qu'il souhaitait si seulement les manieres d'etre d'Odette avec lui laissaient place au doute, il se jetait avidement sur cette parole: --Tu le peux si tu le veux, lui disait-il. Et il tachait de lui montrer que l'apaiser, le diriger, le faire travailler, serait une noble tache a laquelle ne demandaient qu'a se vouer d'autres femmes qu'elle, entre les mains desquelles il est vrai d'ajouter que la noble tache ne lui eut paru plus qu'une indiscrete et insupportable usurpation de sa liberte. Si elle ne m'aimait pas un peu, se disait-il, elle ne souhaiterait pas de me transformer. Pour me transformer, il faudra qu'elle me voie davantage. Ainsi trouvait-il dans ce reproche qu'elle lui faisait, comme une preuve d'interet, d'amour peut-etre; et en effet, elle lui en donnait maintenant si peu qu'il etait oblige de considerer comme telles les defenses qu'elle lui faisait d'une chose ou d'une autre. Un jour, elle lui declara qu'elle n'aimait pas son cocher, qu'il lui montait peut-etre la tete contre elle, qu'en",4.244858923699743,1.5891807931257471,0.34766372589494327,0.08728238113459687,4.545808966861599,4.0,2.616427394709137,33.45652173913044,28.5,23.953493456514156,1.3034437946718649,1.0,0.6302385388976036,1539,582,0.37816764132553604,8292,46,25.20579050548011,88457717415.8825,45952060.99526364,0.814435503217909,0.7824236649003896,62.605285405542844,12.838680255388876,11.635897716609016,16.033680820408513,16.709021103483344,10.044626380766733,55.22390315563466,7.282608695652174,True,65.0,0.8774025974025974,4.307532467532467,1925.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.022909967845659164,0.011053054662379422,0.011053054662379422,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005627009646302251,0.005426045016077171,0.0042202572347266884,0.14025974025974025,74,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"se rappelait pourtant qu'elle avait demande plusieurs fois a Mme des Laumes comment elle pourrait faire pour la rencontrer, mais ne se le rappelait que confusement et d'ailleurs neutralisait et au dela ce souvenir un peu humiliant en murmurant: Ce n'est tout de meme pas a moi a faire les premiers pas, j'ai vingt ans de plus qu'elle. Grace a la vertu de ces paroles interieures, elle rejetait fierement en arriere ses epaules detachees de son buste et sur lesquelles sa tete posee presque horizontalement faisait penser a la tete rapportee d'un orgueilleux faisan qu'on sert sur une table avec toutes ses plumes. Ce n'est pas qu'elle ne fut par nature courtaude, hommasse et boulotte; mais les camouflets l'avaient redressee comme ces arbres qui, nes dans une mauvaise position au bord d'un precipice, sont forces de croitre en arriere pour garder leur equilibre. Obligee, pour se consoler de ne pas etre tout a fait l'egale des autres Guermantes, de se dire sans cesse que c'etait par intransigeance de principes et fierte qu'elle les voyait peu, cette pensee avait fini par modeler son corps et par lui enfanter une sorte de prestance qui passait aux yeux des bourgeoises pour un signe de race et troublait quelquefois d'un desir fugitif le regard fatigue des hommes de cercle. Si on avait fait subir a la conversation de Mme de Gallardon ces analyses qui en relevant la frequence plus ou moins grande de chaque terme permettent de decouvrir la clef d'un langage chiffre, on se fut rendu compte qu'aucune expression, meme la plus usuelle, n'y revenait aussi souvent que chez mes cousins de Guermantes, chez ma tante de Guermantes, la sante d'Elzear de Guermantes, la baignoire de ma cousine de Guermantes. Quand on lui parlait d'un personnage illustre, elle repondait que, sans le connaitre personnellement, elle l'avait rencontre mille fois chez sa tante de Guermantes, mais elle repondait cela d'un ton si glacial et d'une voix si sourde qu'il etait clair que si elle ne le connaissait pas personnellement c'etait en vertu de tous les principes inderacinables et entetes auxquels ses epaules touchaient en arriere, comme a ces echelles sur lesquelles les professeurs de gymnastique vous font etendre pour vous developper le thorax. Or, la princesse des Laumes qu'on ne se serait pas attendu a voir chez Mme de Saint-Euverte, venait precisement d'arriver. Pour montrer qu'elle ne cherchait pas a faire sentir dans un salon ou elle ne venait que par condescendance, la superiorite de son rang, elle etait entree en effacant les epaules la meme ou il n'y avait aucune foule a fendre et personne a laisser passer, restant expres dans le fond, de l'air d'y etre a sa place, comme un roi qui fait la queue a la porte d'un theatre tant que les autorites n'ont pas ete prevenues qu'il est la; et, bornant simplement son regard--pour ne pas avoir l'air de signaler sa presence et de reclamer des egards--a la consideration d'un dessin du tapis ou de sa propre jupe, elle se tenait debout a l'endroit qui lui avait paru le plus modeste (et d'ou elle savait bien qu'une exclamation ravie de Mme de Saint-Euverte allait la tirer des que celle-ci l'aurait apercue), a cote de Mme de Cambremer qui lui etait inconnue. Elle observait la mimique de sa voisine melomane, mais ne l'imitait pas. Ce n'est pas que, pour une fois qu'elle venait passer cinq minutes chez Mme de Saint-Euverte, la princesse des Laumes n'eut souhaite, pour que la politesse qu'elle lui faisait comptat double, se montrer le plus aimable possible. Mais par nature, elle avait horreur de ce qu'elle appelait les exagerations et tenait a montrer qu'elle n'avait pas a se livrer a des manifestations qui n'allaient pas avec le genre de la coterie ou elle vivait, mais qui pourtant d'autre part ne laissaient pas de l'impressionner, a la faveur de cet esprit d'imitation voisin de la timidite que developpe chez les gens les plus surs d'eux-memes l'ambiance d'un milieu nouveau, fut-il inferieur. Elle commencait a se demander si cette gesticulation n'etait pas rendue necessaire par le morceau qu'on jouait et qui ne rentrait peut-etre pas dans le cadre de la musique qu'elle avait entendue jusqu'a ce jour, si s'abstenir n'etait pas faire preuve d'incomprehension a l'egard de l'uvre et d'inconvenance vis-a-vis de la maitresse de la maison: de sorte que pour exprimer par une cote mal taillee ses sentiments contradictoires, tantot elle se contentait de remonter la bride de ses epaulettes ou d'assurer dans ses cheveux blonds les petites boules de corail ou d'email rose, givrees de diamant, qui lui faisaient une coiffure simple et charmante, en examinant avec une froide curiosite sa fougueuse voisine, tantot de son eventail elle battait pendant un instant la mesure, mais, pour ne pas abdiquer son independance, a contretemps. Le pianiste ayant termine le morceau de Liszt et ayant commence un prelude de Chopin, Mme de Cambremer lanca a Mme de Franquetot un sourire attendri de satisfaction competente et d'allusion au passe. Elle avait appris dans sa jeunesse a caresser les phrases, au long col sinueux et demesure, de Chopin, si libres, si flexibles, si tactiles, qui commencent par chercher et essayer leur place en dehors et bien loin de la direction de leur depart, bien loin du point ou on avait pu esperer qu'atteindrait leur attouchement, et qui ne se jouent dans cet ecart de fantaisie que pour revenir plus deliberement,--d'un retour plus premedite, avec plus de precision, comme sur un cristal qui resonnerait jusqu'a faire crier,--vous frapper au cur. Vivant dans une famille provinciale qui avait peu de relations, n'allant guere au bal, elle s'etait grisee dans la solitude de son manoir, a ralentir, a precipiter la danse de tous ces couples imaginaires, a les egrener comme des fleurs, a quitter un moment le bal pour entendre le vent souffler dans les sapins, au bord du lac, et a y voir tout d'un coup s'avancer, plus different de tout ce qu'on a jamais reve que ne sont les amants de la terre, un mince jeune homme a la voix un peu chantante, etrangere et fausse, en gants blancs. Mais aujourd'hui la beaute demodee de cette musique semblait defraichie. Privee depuis quelques annees de l'estime des connaisseurs, elle avait perdu son honneur et son charme et ceux memes dont le gout est mauvais n'y trouvaient plus qu'un plaisir inavoue et mediocre. Mme de Cambremer jeta un regard furtif derriere elle. Elle savait que sa jeune bru (pleine de respect pour sa nouvelle famille, sauf en ce qui touchait les choses de l'esprit sur lesquelles, sachant jusqu'a l'harmonie et jusqu'au grec, elle avait des lumieres speciales) meprisait Chopin et souffrait quand elle en entendait jouer. Mais loin de la surveillance de cette wagnerienne qui etait plus loin avec un groupe de personnes de son age, Mme de Cambremer se laissait aller a des impressions delicieuses. La princesse des Laumes les eprouvait aussi. Sans etre par nature douee pour la musique, elle avait recu il y a quinze ans les lecons qu'un professeur de piano du faubourg Saint-Germain, femme de genie qui avait ete a la fin de sa vie reduite a la misere, avait recommence, a l'age de soixante-dix ans, a donner aux filles et aux petites-filles de ses anciennes eleves. Elle etait morte aujourd'hui. Mais sa methode, son beau son, renaissaient parfois sous les doigts de ses eleves, meme de celles qui etaient devenues pour le reste des personnes mediocres, avaient abandonne la musique et n'ouvraient presque plus jamais un piano. Aussi Mme des Laumes put-elle secouer la tete, en pleine connaissance de cause, avec une appreciation juste de la facon dont le pianiste jouait ce prelude qu'elle savait par cur. La fin de la phrase commencee chanta d'elle-meme sur ses levres. Et elle murmura C'est toujours charmant, avec un double ch au commencement du mot qui etait une marque de delicatesse et dont elle sentait ses levres si romanesquement froissees comme une belle fleur, qu'elle harmonisa instinctivement son regard avec elles en lui donnant a ce moment-la une sorte de sentimentalite et de vague. Cependant Mme de Gallardon etait en train de se dire qu'il etait facheux qu'elle n'eut que bien rarement l'occasion de rencontrer la princesse des Laumes, car elle souhaitait lui donner une lecon en ne repondant pas a son salut. Elle ne savait pas que sa cousine fut la. Un mouvement de tete de Mme de Franquetot la lui decouvrit. Aussitot elle se precipita vers elle en derangeant tout le monde; mais desireuse de garder un air hautain et glacial qui rappelat a tous qu'elle ne desirait pas avoir de relations avec une personne chez qui on pouvait se trouver nez a nez avec la princesse Mathilde, et au-devant de qui elle n'avait pas a aller car elle n'etait pas sa contemporaine, elle voulut pourtant compenser cet air de hauteur et de reserve par quelque propos qui justifiat sa demarche et forcat la princesse a engager la conversation; aussi une fois arrivee pres de sa cousine, Mme de Gallardon, avec un visage dur, une main tendue comme une carte forcee, lui dit: Comment va ton mari? de la meme voix soucieuse que si le prince avait ete gravement malade. La princesse eclatant d'un rire qui lui etait particulier et qui etait destine a la fois a montrer aux autres qu'elle se moquait de quelqu'un et aussi a se faire paraitre plus jolie en concentrant les traits de son visage autour de sa bouche animee et de son regard brillant, lui repondit: --Mais le mieux du monde! Et elle rit encore. Cependant tout en redressant sa taille et refroidissant sa mine, inquiete encore pourtant de l'etat du prince, Mme de Gallardon dit a sa cousine: --Oriane (ici Mme des Laumes regarda d'un air etonne et rieur un tiers invisible vis-a-vis duquel elle semblait tenir a attester qu'elle n'avait jamais autorise Mme de Gallardon a l'appeler par son prenom), je tiendrais beaucoup a ce que tu viennes un moment demain",4.3052542242523355,1.7417516027260032,0.3068132896393039,0.06663494361688109,4.616360177552314,4.0,2.7350675935974054,38.46341463414634,31.0,30.6833533647502,1.3316423589093216,1.0,0.6754838310559511,1577,642,0.40710209258084973,8201,41,20.951265920868906,1256085430.8461626,677865.8558263155,0.7949398115277291,0.8327263165742923,55.137690582612876,15.124111542447068,12.400917723749696,18.12474442055771,19.544763753344576,10.57463538363982,62.17933093091235,9.121951219512194,True,66.0,0.9087965461413924,4.425796006475985,1853.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014095933475306764,0.005273298854071595,0.005273298854071595,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008518405841192577,0.008112767467802455,0.0069972619409796166,0.14624932541824068,77,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"soir chez moi entendre un quintette avec clarinette de Mozart. Je voudrais avoir ton appreciation. Elle semblait non pas adresser une invitation, mais demander un service, et avoir besoin de l'avis de la princesse sur le quintette de Mozart comme si c'avait ete un plat de la composition d'une nouvelle cuisiniere sur les talents de laquelle il lui eut ete precieux de recueillir l'opinion d'un gourmet. --Mais je connais ce quintette, je peux te dire tout de suite... que je l'aime! --Tu sais, mon mari n'est pas bien, son foie..., cela lui ferait grand plaisir de te voir, reprit Mme de Gallardon, faisant maintenant a la princesse une obligation de charite de paraitre a sa soiree. La princesse n'aimait pas a dire aux gens qu'elle ne voulait pas aller chez eux. Tous les jours elle ecrivait son regret d'avoir ete privee--par une visite inopinee de sa belle-mere, par une invitation de son beau-frere, par l'Opera, par une partie de campagne--d'une soiree a laquelle elle n'aurait jamais songe a se rendre. Elle donnait ainsi a beaucoup de gens la joie de croire qu'elle etait de leurs relations, qu'elle eut ete volontiers chez eux, qu'elle n'avait ete empechee de le faire que par les contretemps princiers qu'ils etaient flattes de voir entrer en concurrence avec leur soiree. Puis, faisant partie de cette spirituelle coterie des Guermantes ou survivait quelque chose de l'esprit alerte, depouille de lieux communs et de sentiments convenus, qui descend de Merimee,--et a trouve sa derniere expression dans le theatre de Meilhac et Halevy,--elle l'adaptait meme aux rapports sociaux, le transposait jusque dans sa politesse qui s'efforcait d'etre positive, precise, de se rapprocher de l'humble verite. Elle ne developpait pas longuement a une maitresse de maison l'expression du desir qu'elle avait d'aller a sa soiree; elle trouvait plus aimable de lui exposer quelques petits faits d'ou dependrait qu'il lui fut ou non possible de s'y rendre. --Ecoute, je vais te dire, dit-elle a Mme de Gallardon, il faut demain soir que j'aille chez une amie qui m'a demande mon jour depuis longtemps. Si elle nous emmene au theatre, il n'y aura pas, avec la meilleure volonte, possibilite que j'aille chez toi; mais si nous restons chez elle, comme je sais que nous serons seuls, je pourrai la quitter. --Tiens, tu as vu ton ami M. Swann? --Mais non, cet amour de Charles, je ne savais pas qu'il fut la, je vais tacher qu'il me voie. --C'est drole qu'il aille meme chez la mere Saint-Euverte, dit Mme de Gallardon. Oh! je sais qu'il est intelligent, ajouta-t-elle en voulant dire par la intrigant, mais cela ne fait rien, un juif chez la sur et la belle-sur de deux archeveques! --J'avoue a ma honte que je n'en suis pas choquee, dit la princesse des Laumes. --Je sais qu'il est converti, et meme deja ses parents et ses grands-parents. Mais on dit que les convertis restent plus attaches a leur religion que les autres, que c'est une frime, est-ce vrai? --Je suis sans lumieres a ce sujet. Le pianiste qui avait a jouer deux morceaux de Chopin, apres avoir termine le prelude avait attaque aussitot une polonaise. Mais depuis que Mme de Gallardon avait signale a sa cousine la presence de Swann, Chopin ressuscite aurait pu venir jouer lui-meme toutes ses uvres sans que Mme des Laumes put y faire attention. Elle faisait partie d'une de ces deux moities de l'humanite chez qui la curiosite qu'a l'autre moitie pour les etres qu'elle ne connait pas est remplacee par l'interet pour les etres qu'elle connait. Comme beaucoup de femmes du faubourg Saint-Germain la presence dans un endroit ou elle se trouvait de quelqu'un de sa coterie, et auquel d'ailleurs elle n'avait rien de particulier a dire, accaparait exclusivement son attention aux depens de tout le reste. A partir de ce moment, dans l'espoir que Swann la remarquerait, la princesse ne fit plus, comme une souris blanche apprivoisee a qui on tend puis on retire un morceau de sucre, que tourner sa figure, remplie de mille signes de connivence denues de rapports avec le sentiment de la polonaise de Chopin, dans la direction ou etait Swann et si celui-ci changeait de place, elle deplacait parallelement son sourire aimante. --Oriane, ne te fache pas, reprit Mme de Gallardon qui ne pouvait jamais s'empecher de sacrifier ses plus grandes esperances sociales et d'eblouir un jour le monde, au plaisir obscur, immediat et prive, de dire quelque chose de desagreable, il y a des gens qui pretendent que ce M. Swann, c'est quelqu'un qu'on ne peut pas recevoir chez soi, est-ce vrai? --Mais... tu dois bien savoir que c'est vrai, repondit la princesse des Laumes, puisque tu l'as invite cinquante fois et qu'il n'est jamais venu. Et quittant sa cousine mortifiee, elle eclata de nouveau d'un rire qui scandalisa les personnes qui ecoutaient la musique, mais attira l'attention de Mme de Saint-Euverte, restee par politesse pres du piano et qui apercut seulement alors la princesse. Mme de Saint-Euverte etait d'autant plus ravie de voir Mme des Laumes qu'elle la croyait encore a Guermantes en train de soigner son beau-pere malade. --Mais comment, princesse, vous etiez la? --Oui, je m'etais mise dans un petit coin, j'ai entendu de belles choses. --Comment, vous etes la depuis deja un long moment! --Mais oui, un tres long moment qui m'a semble tres court, long seulement parce que je ne vous voyais pas. Mme de Saint-Euverte voulut donner son fauteuil a la princesse qui repondit: --Mais pas du tout! Pourquoi? Je suis bien n'importe ou! Et, avisant avec intention, pour mieux manifester sa simplicite de grande dame, un petit siege sans dossier: --Tenez, ce pouf, c'est tout ce qu'il me faut. Cela me fera tenir droite. Oh! mon Dieu, je fais encore du bruit, je vais me faire conspuer. Cependant le pianiste redoublant de vitesse, l'emotion musicale etait a son comble, un domestique passait des rafraichissements sur un plateau et faisait tinter des cuillers et, comme chaque semaine, Mme de Saint-Euverte lui faisait, sans qu'il la vit, des signes de s'en aller. Une nouvelle mariee, a qui on avait appris qu'une jeune femme ne doit pas avoir l'air blase, souriait de plaisir, et cherchait des yeux la maitresse de maison pour lui temoigner par son regard sa reconnaissance d'avoir pense a elle pour un pareil regal. Pourtant, quoique avec plus de calme que Mme de Franquetot, ce n'est pas sans inquietude qu'elle suivait le morceau; mais la sienne avait pour objet, au lieu du pianiste, le piano sur lequel une bougie tressautant a chaque fortissimo, risquait, sinon de mettre le feu a l'abat-jour, du moins de faire des taches sur le palissandre. A la fin elle n'y tint plus et, escaladant les deux marches de l'estrade, sur laquelle etait place le piano, se precipita pour enlever la bobeche. Mais a peine ses mains allaient-elles la toucher que sur un dernier accord, le morceau finit et le pianiste se leva. Neanmoins l'initiative hardie de cette jeune femme, la courte promiscuite qui en resulta entre elle et l'instrumentiste, produisirent une impression generalement favorable. --Vous avez remarque ce qu'a fait cette personne, princesse, dit le general de Froberville a la princesse des Laumes qu'il etait venu saluer et que Mme de Saint-Euverte quitta un instant. C'est curieux. Est-ce donc une artiste? --Non, c'est une petite Mme de Cambremer, repondit etourdiment la princesse et elle ajouta vivement: Je vous repete ce que j'ai entendu dire, je n'ai aucune espece de notion de qui c'est, on a dit derriere moi que c'etaient des voisins de campagne de Mme de Saint-Euverte, mais je ne crois pas que personne les connaisse. Ca doit etre des gens de la campagne! Du reste, je ne sais pas si vous etes tres repandu dans la brillante societe qui se trouve ici, mais je n'ai pas idee du nom de toutes ces etonnantes personnes. A quoi pensez-vous qu'ils passent leur vie en dehors des soirees de Mme de Saint-Euverte? Elle a du les faire venir avec les musiciens, les chaises et les rafraichissements. Avouez que ces invites de chez Belloir sont magnifiques. Est-ce que vraiment elle a le courage de louer ces figurants toutes les semaines. Ce n'est pas possible! --Ah! Mais Cambremer, c'est un nom authentique et ancien, dit le general. --Je ne vois aucun mal a ce que ce soit ancien, repondit sechement la princesse, mais en tous cas ce n'est-ce pas euphonique, ajouta-t-elle en detachant le mot euphonique comme s'il etait entre guillemets, petite affectation de depit qui etait particuliere a la coterie Guermantes. --Vous trouvez? Elle est jolie a croquer, dit le general qui ne perdait pas Mme de Cambremer de vue. Ce n'est pas votre avis, princesse? --Elle se met trop en avant, je trouve que chez une si jeune femme, ce n'est pas agreable, car je ne crois pas qu'elle soit ma contemporaine, repondit Mme des Laumes (cette expression etant commune aux Gallardon et aux Guermantes). Mais la princesse voyant que M. de Froberville continuait a regarder Mme de Cambremer, ajouta moitie par mechancete pour celle-ci, moitie par amabilite pour le general: Pas agreable... pour son mari! Je regrette de ne pas la connaitre puisqu'elle vous tient a cur, je vous aurais presente, dit la princesse qui probablement n'en aurait rien fait si elle avait connu la jeune femme. Je vais etre obligee de vous dire bonsoir, parce que c'est la fete d'une amie a qui je dois aller la souhaiter, dit-elle d'un ton modeste et vrai, reduisant la reunion mondaine a laquelle elle se rendait a la simplicite d'une ceremonie ennuyeuse mais ou il etait obligatoire et touchant d'aller. D'ailleurs je dois y retrouver Basin qui, pendant que j'etais ici, est alle voir ses amis que vous connaissez, je crois, qui ont un nom de pont, les Iena. --C'a ete d'abord un nom de victoire, princesse, dit le general. Qu'est-ce que vous voulez, pour un vieux briscard comme moi, ajouta-t-il en otant son monocle pour l'essuyer, comme il",3.5202817162564997,1.6304029498970927,0.33151296622563536,0.12152660961717855,4.557522123893805,4.0,2.5870759070577005,20.81578947368421,18.5,15.156821051154866,1.3527180783817951,1.0,0.6945622784889205,1582,608,0.3843236409608091,8215,76,27.237155878761982,674444940227.5549,345161177.1891274,0.6768624781444669,0.652637728364081,71.26702425311068,8.490231219642023,10.65788864234165,11.663863197817552,10.443823940381925,9.57623261694058,43.69821678089028,4.7631578947368425,True,53.0,0.868474923234391,4.2041965199590585,1954.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03564556962025316,0.02359493670886076,0.00850632911392405,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.009721518987341773,0.010531645569620253,0.009215189873417722,0.13254861821903788,78,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"magnifique et dedaigne que Swann montait a ce moment, d'un cote et de l'autre, a des hauteurs differentes, devant chaque anfractuosite que faisait dans le mur la fenetre de la loge, ou la porte d'un appartement, representant le service interieur qu'ils dirigeaient et en faisant hommage aux invites, un concierge, un majordome, un argentier (braves gens qui vivaient le reste de la semaine un peu independants dans leur domaine, y dinaient chez eux comme de petits boutiquiers et seraient peut-etre demain au service bourgeois d'un medecin ou d'un industriel) attentifs a ne pas manquer aux recommandations qu'on leur avait faites avant de leur laisser endosser la livree eclatante qu'ils ne revetaient qu'a de rares intervalles et dans laquelle ils ne se sentaient pas tres a leur aise, se tenaient sous l'arcature de leur portail avec un eclat pompeux tempere de bonhomie populaire, comme des saints dans leur niche; et un enorme suisse, habille comme a l'eglise, frappait les dalles de sa canne au passage de chaque arrivant. Parvenu en haut de l'escalier le long duquel l'avait suivi un domestique a face bleme, avec une petite queue de cheveux, noues d'un catogan, derriere la tete, comme un sacristain de Goya ou un tabellion du repertoire, Swann passa devant un bureau ou des valets, assis comme des notaires devant de grands registres, se leverent et inscrivirent son nom. Il traversa alors un petit vestibule qui,--tel que certaines pieces amenagees par leur proprietaire pour servir de cadre a une seule uvre d'art, dont elles tirent leur nom, et d'une nudite voulue, ne contiennent rien d'autre--, exhibait a son entree, comme quelque precieuse effigie de Benvenuto Cellini representant un homme de guet, un jeune valet de pied, le corps legerement flechi en avant, dressant sur son hausse-col rouge une figure plus rouge encore d'ou s'echappaient des torrents de feu, de timidite et de zele, et qui, percant les tapisseries d'Aubusson tendues devant le salon ou on ecoutait la musique, de son regard impetueux, vigilant, eperdu, avait l'air, avec une impassibilite militaire ou une foi surnaturelle,--allegorie de l'alarme, incarnation de l'attente, commemoration du branle-bas,--d'epier, ange ou vigie, d'une tour de donjon ou de cathedrale, l'apparition de l'ennemi ou l'heure du Jugement. Il ne restait plus a Swann qu'a penetrer dans la salle du concert dont un huissier charge de chaines lui ouvrit les portes, en s'inclinant, comme il lui aurait remis les clefs d'une ville. Mais il pensait a la maison ou il aurait pu se trouver en ce moment meme, si Odette l'avait permis, et le souvenir entrevu d'une boite au lait vide sur un paillasson lui serra le cur. Swann retrouva rapidement le sentiment de la laideur masculine, quand, au dela de la tenture de tapisserie, au spectacle des domestiques succeda celui des invites. Mais cette laideur meme de visages qu'il connaissait pourtant si bien, lui semblait neuve depuis que leurs traits,--au lieu d'etre pour lui des signes pratiquement utilisables a l'identification de telle personne qui lui avait represente jusque-la un faisceau de plaisirs a poursuivre, d'ennuis a eviter, ou de politesses a rendre,--reposaient, coordonnes seulement par des rapports esthetiques, dans l'autonomie de leurs lignes. Et en ces hommes, au milieu desquels Swann se trouva enserre, il n'etait pas jusqu'aux monocles que beaucoup portaient (et qui, autrefois, auraient tout au plus permis a Swann de dire qu'ils portaient un monocle), qui, delies maintenant de signifier une habitude, la meme pour tous, ne lui apparussent chacun avec une sorte d'individualite. Peut-etre parce qu'il ne regarda le general de Froberville et le marquis de Breaute qui causaient dans l'entree que comme deux personnages dans un tableau, alors qu'ils avaient ete longtemps pour lui les amis utiles qui l'avaient presente au Jockey et assiste dans des duels, le monocle du general, reste entre ses paupieres comme un eclat d'obus dans sa figure vulgaire, balafree et triomphale, au milieu du front qu'il eborgnait comme l'il unique du cyclope, apparut a Swann comme une blessure monstrueuse qu'il pouvait etre glorieux d'avoir recue, mais qu'il etait indecent d'exhiber; tandis que celui que M. de Breaute ajoutait, en signe de festivite, aux gants gris perle, au gibus, a la cravate blanche et substituait au binocle familier (comme faisait Swann lui-meme) pour aller dans le monde, portait colle a son revers, comme une preparation d'histoire naturelle sous un microscope, un regard infinitesimal et grouillant d'amabilite, qui ne cessait de sourire a la hauteur des plafonds, a la beaute des fetes, a l'interet des programmes et a la qualite des rafraichissements. --Tiens, vous voila, mais il y a des eternites qu'on ne vous a vu, dit a Swann le general qui, remarquant ses traits tires et en concluant que c'etait peut-etre une maladie grave qui l'eloignait du monde, ajouta: Vous avez bonne mine, vous savez! pendant que M. de Breaute demandait: --Comment, vous, mon cher, qu'est-ce que vous pouvez bien faire ici? a un romancier mondain qui venait d'installer au coin de son il un monocle, son seul organe d'investigation psychologique et d'impitoyable analyse, et repondit d'un air important et mysterieux, en roulant l'r: --J'observe. Le monocle du marquis de Forestelle etait minuscule, n'avait aucune bordure et obligeant a une crispation incessante et douloureuse l'il ou il s'incrustait comme un cartilage superflu dont la presence est inexplicable et la matiere recherchee, il donnait au visage du marquis une delicatesse melancolique, et le faisait juger par les femmes comme capable de grands chagrins d'amour. Mais celui de M. de Saint-Cande, entoure d'un gigantesque anneau, comme Saturne, etait le centre de gravite d'une figure qui s'ordonnait a tout moment par rapport a lui, dont le nez fremissant et rouge et la bouche lippue et sarcastique tachaient par leurs grimaces d'etre a la hauteur des feux roulants d'esprit dont etincelait le disque de verre, et se voyait preferer aux plus beaux regards du monde par des jeunes femmes snobs et depravees qu'il faisait rever de charmes artificiels et d'un raffinement de volupte; et cependant, derriere le sien, M. de Palancy qui avec sa grosse tete de carpe aux yeux ronds, se deplacait lentement au milieu des fetes, en desserrant d'instant en instant ses mandibules comme pour chercher son orientation, avait l'air de transporter seulement avec lui un fragment accidentel, et peut-etre purement symbolique, du vitrage de son aquarium, partie destinee a figurer le tout qui rappela a Swann, grand admirateur des Vices et des Vertus de Giotto a Padoue, cet Injuste a cote duquel un rameau feuillu evoque les forets ou se cache son repaire. Swann s'etait avance, sur l'insistance de Mme de Saint-Euverte et pour entendre un air d'Orphee qu'executait un flutiste, s'etait mis dans un coin ou il avait malheureusement comme seule perspective deux dames deja mures assises l'une a cote de l'autre, la marquise de Cambremer et la vicomtesse de Franquetot, lesquelles, parce qu'elles etaient cousines, passaient leur temps dans les soirees, portant leurs sacs et suivies de leurs filles, a se chercher comme dans une gare et n'etaient tranquilles que quand elles avaient marque, par leur eventail ou leur mouchoir, deux places voisines: Mme de Cambremer, comme elle avait tres peu de relations, etant d'autant plus heureuse d'avoir une compagne, Mme de Franquetot, qui etait au contraire tres lancee, trouvait quelque chose d'elegant, d'original, a montrer a toutes ses belles connaissances qu'elle leur preferait une dame obscure avec qui elle avait en commun des souvenirs de jeunesse. Plein d'une melancolique ironie, Swann les regardait ecouter l'intermede de piano (Saint Francois parlant aux oiseaux, de Liszt) qui avait succede a l'air de flute, et suivre le jeu vertigineux du virtuose. Mme de Franquetot anxieusement, les yeux eperdus comme si les touches sur lesquelles il courait avec agilite avaient ete une suite de trapezes d'ou il pouvait tomber d'une hauteur de quatre-vingts metres, et non sans lancer a sa voisine des regards d'etonnement, de denegation qui signifiaient: Ce n'est pas croyable, je n'aurais jamais pense qu'un homme put faire cela, Mme de Cambremer, en femme qui a recu une forte education musicale, battant la mesure avec sa tete transformee en balancier de metronome dont l'amplitude et la rapidite d'oscillations d'une epaule a l'autre etaient devenues telles (avec cette espece d'egarement et d'abandon du regard qu'ont les douleurs qui ne se connaissent plus ni ne cherchent a se maitriser et disent: Que voulez-vous!) qu'a tout moment elle accrochait avec ses solitaires les pattes de son corsage et etait obligee de redresser les raisins noirs qu'elle avait dans les cheveux, sans cesser pour cela d'accelerer le mouvement. De l'autre cote de Mme de Franquetot, mais un peu en avant, etait la marquise de Gallardon, occupee a sa pensee favorite, l'alliance qu'elle avait avec les Guermantes et d'ou elle tirait pour le monde et pour elle-meme beaucoup de gloire avec quelque honte, les plus brillants d'entre eux la tenant un peu a l'ecart, peut-etre parce qu'elle etait ennuyeuse, ou parce qu'elle etait mechante, ou parce qu'elle etait d'une branche inferieure, ou peut-etre sans aucune raison. Quand elle se trouvait aupres de quelqu'un qu'elle ne connaissait pas, comme en ce moment aupres de Mme de Franquetot, elle souffrait que la conscience qu'elle avait de sa parente avec les Guermantes ne put se manifester exterieurement en caracteres visibles comme ceux qui, dans les mosaiques des eglises byzantines, places les uns au-dessous des autres, inscrivent en une colonne verticale, a cote d'un Saint Personnage les mots qu'il est cense prononcer. Elle songeait en ce moment qu'elle n'avait jamais recu une invitation ni une visite de sa jeune cousine la princesse des Laumes, depuis six ans que celle-ci etait mariee. Cette pensee la remplissait de colere, mais aussi de fierte; car a force de dire aux personnes qui s'etonnaient de ne pas la voir chez Mme des Laumes, que c'est parce qu'elle aurait ete exposee a y rencontrer la princesse Mathilde--ce que sa famille ultra-legitimiste ne lui aurait jamais pardonne, elle avait fini par croire que c'etait en effet la raison pour laquelle elle n'allait pas chez sa jeune cousine.

"aurait change un pansement, tandis que la princesse detournait instinctivement les yeux, cette noblesse d'Empire, c'est autre chose bien entendu, mais enfin, pour ce que c'est, c'est tres beau dans son genre, ce sont des gens qui en somme se sont battus en heros. --Mais je suis pleine de respect pour les heros, dit la princesse, sur un ton legerement ironique: si je ne vais pas avec Basin chez cette princesse d'Iena, ce n'est pas du tout pour ca, c'est tout simplement parce que je ne les connais pas. Basin les connait, les cherit. Oh! non, ce n'est pas ce que vous pouvez penser, ce n'est pas un flirt, je n'ai pas a m'y opposer! Du reste, pour ce que cela sert quand je veux m'y opposer! ajouta-t-elle d'une voix melancolique, car tout le monde savait que des le lendemain du jour ou le prince des Laumes avait epouse sa ravissante cousine, il n'avait pas cesse de la tromper. Mais enfin ce n'est pas le cas, ce sont des gens qu'il a connus autrefois, il en fait ses choux gras, je trouve cela tres bien. D'abord je vous dirai que rien que ce qu'il m'a dit de leur maison... Pensez que tous leurs meubles sont Empire! --Mais, princesse, naturellement, c'est parce que c'est le mobilier de leurs grands-parents. --Mais je ne vous dis pas, mais ca n'est pas moins laid pour ca. Je comprends tres bien qu'on ne puisse pas avoir de jolies choses, mais au moins qu'on n'ait pas de choses ridicules. Qu'est-ce que vous voulez? je ne connais rien de plus pompier, de plus bourgeois que cet horrible style avec ces commodes qui ont des tetes de cygnes comme des baignoires. --Mais je crois meme qu'ils ont de belles choses, ils doivent avoir la fameuse table de mosaique sur laquelle a ete signe le traite de... --Ah! Mais qu'ils aient des choses interessantes au point de vue de l'histoire, je ne vous dis pas. Mais ca ne peut pas etre beau... puisque c'est horrible! Moi j'ai aussi des choses comme ca que Basin a heritees des Montesquiou. Seulement elles sont dans les greniers de Guermantes ou personne ne les voit. Enfin, du reste, ce n'est pas la question, je me precipiterais chez eux avec Basin, j'irais les voir meme au milieu de leurs sphinx et de leur cuivre si je les connaissais, mais... je ne les connais pas! Moi, on m'a toujours dit quand j'etais petite que ce n'etait pas poli d'aller chez les gens qu'on ne connaissait pas, dit-elle en prenant un ton pueril. Alors, je fais ce qu'on m'a appris. Voyez-vous ces braves gens s'ils voyaient entrer une personne qu'ils ne connaissent pas? Ils me recevraient peut-etre tres mal! dit la princesse. Et par coquetterie elle embellit le sourire que cette supposition lui arrachait, en donnant a son regard fixe sur le general une expression reveuse et douce. --Ah! princesse, vous savez bien qu'ils ne se tiendraient pas de joie... --Mais non, pourquoi? lui demanda-t-elle avec une extreme vivacite, soit pour ne pas avoir l'air de savoir que c'est parce qu'elle etait une des plus grandes dames de France, soit pour avoir le plaisir de l'entendre dire au general. Pourquoi? Qu'en savez-vous? Cela leur serait peut-etre tout ce qu'il y a de plus desagreable. Moi je ne sais pas, mais si j'en juge par moi, cela m'ennuie deja tant de voir les personnes que je connais, je crois que s'il fallait voir des gens que je ne connais pas, meme heroiques, je deviendrais folle. D'ailleurs, voyons, sauf lorsqu'il s'agit de vieux amis comme vous qu'on connait sans cela, je ne sais pas si l'heroisme serait d'un format tres portatif dans le monde. Ca m'ennuie deja souvent de donner des diners, mais s'il fallait offrir le bras a Spartacus pour aller a table... Non vraiment, ce ne serait jamais a Vercingetorix que je ferais signe comme quatorzieme. Je sens que je le reserverais pour les grandes soirees. Et comme je n'en donne pas... --Ah! princesse, vous n'etes pas Guermantes pour des prunes. Le possedez-vous assez, l'esprit des Guermantes! --Mais on dit toujours l'esprit des Guermantes, je n'ai jamais pu comprendre pourquoi. Vous en connaissez donc d'autres qui en aient, ajouta-t-elle dans un eclat de rire ecumant et joyeux, les traits de son visage concentres, accouples dans le reseau de son animation, les yeux etincelants, enflammes d'un ensoleillement radieux de gaite que seuls avaient le pouvoir de faire rayonner ainsi les propos, fussent-ils tenus par la princesse elle-meme, qui etaient une louange de son esprit ou de sa beaute. Tenez, voila Swann qui a l'air de saluer votre Cambremer; la... il est a cote de la mere Saint-Euverte, vous ne voyez pas! Demandez-lui de vous presenter. Mais depechez-vous, il cherche a s'en aller! --Avez-vous remarque quelle affreuse mine il a? dit le general. --Mon petit Charles! Ah! enfin il vient, je commencais a supposer qu'il ne voulait pas me voir! Swann aimait beaucoup la princesse des Laumes, puis sa vue lui rappelait Guermantes, terre voisine de Combray, tout ce pays qu'il aimait tant et ou il ne retournait plus pour ne pas s'eloigner d'Odette. Usant des formes mi-artistes, mi-galantes, par lesquelles il savait plaire a la princesse et qu'il retrouvait tout naturellement quand il se retrempait un instant dans son ancien milieu,--et voulant d'autre part pour lui-meme exprimer la nostalgie qu'il avait de la campagne: --Ah! dit-il a la cantonade, pour etre entendu a la fois de Mme de Saint-Euverte a qui il parlait et de Mme des Laumes pour qui il parlait, voici la charmante princesse! Voyez, elle est venue tout expres de Guermantes pour entendre le Saint-Francois d'Assise de Liszt et elle n'a eu le temps, comme une jolie mesange, que d'aller piquer pour les mettre sur sa tete quelques petits fruits de prunier des oiseaux et d'aubepine; il y a meme encore de petites gouttes de rosee, un peu de la gelee blanche qui doit faire gemir la duchesse. C'est tres joli, ma chere princesse. --Comment la princesse est venue expres de Guermantes? Mais c'est trop! Je ne savais pas, je suis confuse, s'ecrie naivement Mme de Saint-Euverte qui etait peu habituee au tour d'esprit de Swann. Et examinant la coiffure de la princesse: Mais c'est vrai, cela imite... comment dirais-je, pas les chataignes, non, oh! c'est une idee ravissante, mais comment la princesse pouvait-elle connaitre mon programme. Les musiciens ne me l'ont meme pas communique a moi. Swann, habitue quand il etait aupres d'une femme avec qui il avait garde des habitudes galantes de langage, de dire des choses delicates que beaucoup de gens du monde ne comprenaient pas, ne daigna pas expliquer a Mme de Saint-Euverte qu'il n'avait parle que par metaphore. Quant a la princesse, elle se mit a rire aux eclats, parce que l'esprit de Swann etait extremement apprecie dans sa coterie et aussi parce qu'elle ne pouvait entendre un compliment s'adressant a elle sans lui trouver les graces les plus fines et une irresistible drolerie. --He bien! je suis ravie, Charles, si mes petits fruits d'aubepine vous plaisent. Pourquoi est-ce que vous saluez cette Cambremer, est-ce que vous etes aussi son voisin de campagne? Mme de Saint-Euverte voyant que la princesse avait l'air content de causer avec Swann s'etait eloignee. --Mais vous l'etes vous-meme, princesse. --Moi, mais ils ont donc des campagnes partout, ces gens! Mais comme j'aimerais etre a leur place! --Ce ne sont pas les Cambremer, c'etaient ses parents a elle; elle est une demoiselle Legrandin qui venait a Combray. Je ne sais pas si vous savez que vous etes la comtesse de Combray et que le chapitre vous doit une redevance. --Je ne sais pas ce que me doit le chapitre mais je sais que je suis tapee de cent francs tous les ans par le cure, ce dont je me passerais. Enfin ces Cambremer ont un nom bien etonnant. Il finit juste a temps, mais il finit mal! dit-elle en riant. --Il ne commence pas mieux, repondit Swann. --En effet cette double abreviation! --C'est quelqu'un de tres en colere et de tres convenable qui n'a pas ose aller jusqu'au bout du premier mot. --Mais puisqu'il ne devait pas pouvoir s'empecher de commencer le second, il aurait mieux fait d'achever le premier pour en finir une bonne fois. Nous sommes en train de faire des plaisanteries d'un gout charmant, mon petit Charles, mais comme c'est ennuyeux de ne plus vous voir, ajouta-t-elle d'un ton calin, j'aime tant causer avec vous. Pensez que je n'aurais meme pas pu faire comprendre a cet idiot de Froberville que le nom de Cambremer etait etonnant. Avouez que la vie est une chose affreuse. Il n'y a que quand je vous vois que je cesse de m'ennuyer. Et sans doute cela n'etait pas vrai. Mais Swann et la princesse avaient une meme maniere de juger les petites choses qui avait pour effet--a moins que ce ne fut pour cause--une grande analogie dans la facon de s'exprimer et jusque dans la prononciation. Cette ressemblance ne frappait pas parce que rien n'etait plus different que leurs deux voix. Mais si on parvenait par la pensee a oter aux propos de Swann la sonorite qui les enveloppait, les moustaches d'entre lesquelles ils sortaient, on se rendait compte que c'etaient les memes phrases, les memes inflexions, le tour de la coterie Guermantes. Pour les choses importantes, Swann et la princesse n'avaient les memes idees sur rien. Mais depuis que Swann etait si triste, ressentant toujours cette espece de frisson qui precede le moment ou l'on va pleurer, il avait le meme besoin de parler du chagrin qu'un assassin a de parler de son crime. En entendant la princesse lui dire que la vie etait une chose affreuse, il eprouva la meme douceur que si elle lui avait parle d'Odette. --Oh! oui, la vie est une chose affreuse. Il faut que nous nous voyions, ma chere amie. Ce qu'il y a de gentil avec vous, c'est que vous",3.3334042875002687,1.7218246354572408,0.32697575560706194,0.10982952159998798,4.400760938490805,4.0,2.4206780792307163,17.719101123595507,13.0,14.462651445446324,1.2872542802790108,1.0,0.6264482578838512,1577,554,0.3512999365884591,7985,89,26.232955669458672,247074480710.66776,125801670.42294692,0.6238799750466238,0.6059015722110354,79.94840024794625,6.5100499454945755,9.000124047880107,9.471914387294893,8.157134582089444,8.40596068484464,36.171859525624676,3.269662921348315,True,53.0,0.8660896130346232,4.065682281059063,1964.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.038880248833592534,0.009953343701399688,0.006842923794712286,0.006842923794712286,0.0,0.0,0.017418351477449457,0.006220839813374806,0.005806117159149819,0.11558044806517312,79,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"C'est ecrit de l'hotel Vouillemont? Qu'y peut-elle etre allee faire! avec qui? que s'y est-il passe? Il se rappela les becs de gaz qu'on eteignait boulevard des Italiens quand il l'avait rencontree contre tout espoir parmi les ombres errantes dans cette nuit qui lui avait semble presque surnaturelle et qui en effet--nuit d'un temps ou il n'avait meme pas a se demander s'il ne la contrarierait pas en la cherchant, en la retrouvant, tant il etait sur qu'elle n'avait pas de plus grande joie que de le voir et de rentrer avec lui,--appartenait bien a un monde mysterieux ou on ne peut jamais revenir quand les portes s'en sont refermees. Et Swann apercut, immobile en face de ce bonheur revecu, un malheureux qui lui fit pitie parce qu'il ne le reconnut pas tout de suite, si bien qu'il dut baisser les yeux pour qu'on ne vit pas qu'ils etaient pleins de larmes. C'etait lui-meme. Quand il l'eut compris, sa pitie cessa, mais il fut jaloux de l'autre lui-meme qu'elle avait aime, il fut jaloux de ceux dont il s'etait dit souvent sans trop souffrir, elle les aime peut-etre, maintenant qu'il avait echange l'idee vague d'aimer, dans laquelle il n'y a pas d'amour, contre les petales du chrysantheme et l'en tete de la Maison d'Or, qui, eux en etaient pleins. Puis sa souffrance devenant trop vive, il passa sa main sur son front, laissa tomber son monocle, en essuya le verre. Et sans doute s'il s'etait vu a ce moment-la, il eut ajoute a la collection de ceux qu'il avait distingues le monocle qu'il deplacait comme une pensee importune et sur la face embuee duquel, avec un mouchoir, il cherchait a effacer des soucis. Il y a dans le violon,--si ne voyant pas l'instrument, on ne peut pas rapporter ce qu'on entend a son image laquelle modifie la sonorite--des accents qui lui sont si communs avec certaines voix de contralto, qu'on a l'illusion qu'une chanteuse s'est ajoutee au concert. On leve les yeux, on ne voit que les etuis, precieux comme des boites chinoises, mais, par moment, on est encore trompe par l'appel decevant de la sirene; parfois aussi on croit entendre un genie captif qui se debat au fond de la docte boite, ensorcelee et fremissante, comme un diable dans un benitier; parfois enfin, c'est, dans l'air, comme un etre surnaturel et pur qui passe en deroulant son message invisible. Comme si les instrumentistes, beaucoup moins jouaient la petite phrase qu'ils n'executaient les rites exiges d'elle pour qu'elle apparut, et procedaient aux incantations necessaires pour obtenir et prolonger quelques instants le prodige de son evocation, Swann, qui ne pouvait pas plus la voir que si elle avait appartenu a un monde ultra-violet, et qui goutait comme le rafraichissement d'une metamorphose dans la cecite momentanee dont il etait frappe en approchant d'elle, Swann la sentait presente, comme une deesse protectrice et confidente de son amour, et qui pour pouvoir arriver jusqu'a lui devant la foule et l'emmener a l'ecart pour lui parler, avait revetu le deguisement de cette apparence sonore. Et tandis qu'elle passait, legere, apaisante et murmuree comme un parfum, lui disant ce qu'elle avait a lui dire et dont il scrutait tous les mots, regrettant de les voir s'envoler si vite, il faisait involontairement avec ses levres le mouvement de baiser au passage le corps harmonieux et fuyant. Il ne se sentait plus exile et seul puisque, elle, qui s'adressait a lui, lui parlait a mi-voix d'Odette. Car il n'avait plus comme autrefois l'impression qu'Odette et lui n'etaient pas connus de la petite phrase. C'est que si souvent elle avait ete temoin de leurs joies! Il est vrai que souvent aussi elle l'avait averti de leur fragilite. Et meme, alors que dans ce temps-la il devinait de la souffrance dans son sourire, dans son intonation limpide et desenchantee, aujourd'hui il y trouvait plutot la grace d'une resignation presque gaie. De ces chagrins dont elle lui parlait autrefois et qu'il la voyait, sans qu'il fut atteint par eux, entrainer en souriant dans son cours sinueux et rapide, de ces chagrins qui maintenant etaient devenus les siens sans qu'il eut l'esperance d'en etre jamais delivre, elle semblait lui dire comme jadis de son bonheur: Qu'est-ce, cela? tout cela n'est rien. Et la pensee de Swann se porta pour la premiere fois dans un elan de pitie et de tendresse vers ce Vinteuil, vers ce frere inconnu et sublime qui lui aussi avait du tant souffrir; qu'avait pu etre sa vie? au fond de quelles douleurs avait-il puise cette force de dieu, cette puissance illimitee de creer? Quand c'etait la petite phrase qui lui parlait de la vanite de ses souffrances, Swann trouvait de la douceur a cette meme sagesse qui tout a l'heure pourtant lui avait paru intolerable, quand il croyait la lire dans les visages des indifferents qui consideraient son amour comme une divagation sans importance. C'est que la petite phrase au contraire, quelque opinion qu'elle put avoir sur la breve duree de ces etats de l'ame, y voyait quelque chose, non pas comme faisaient tous ces gens, de moins serieux que la vie positive, mais au contraire de si superieur a elle que seul il valait la peine d'etre exprime. Ces charmes d'une tristesse intime, c'etait eux qu'elle essayait d'imiter, de recreer, et jusqu'a leur essence qui est pourtant d'etre incommunicables et de sembler frivoles a tout autre qu'a celui qui les eprouve, la petite phrase l'avait captee, rendue visible. Si bien qu'elle faisait confesser leur prix et gouter leur douceur divine, par tous ces memes assistants--si seulement ils etaient un peu musiciens--qui ensuite les meconnaitraient dans la vie, en chaque amour particulier qu'ils verraient naitre pres d'eux. Sans doute la forme sous laquelle elle les avait codifies ne pouvait pas se resoudre en raisonnements. Mais depuis plus d'une annee que lui revelant a lui-meme bien des richesses de son ame, l'amour de la musique etait pour quelque temps au moins ne en lui, Swann tenait les motifs musicaux pour de veritables idees, d'un autre monde, d'un autre ordre, idees voilees de tenebres, inconnues, impenetrables a l'intelligence, mais qui n'en sont pas moins parfaitement distinctes les unes des autres, inegales entre elles de valeur et de signification. Quand apres la soiree Verdurin, se faisant rejouer la petite phrase, il avait cherche a demeler comment a la facon d'un parfum, d'une caresse, elle le circonvenait, elle l'enveloppait, il s'etait rendu compte que c'etait au faible ecart entre les cinq notes qui la composaient et au rappel constant de deux d'entre elles qu'etait due cette impression de douceur retractee et frileuse; mais en realite il savait qu'il raisonnait ainsi non sur la phrase elle-meme mais sur de simples valeurs, substituees pour la commodite de son intelligence a la mysterieuse entite qu'il avait percue, avant de connaitre les Verdurin, a cette soiree ou il avait entendu pour la premiere fois la sonate. Il savait que le souvenir meme du piano faussait encore le plan dans lequel il voyait les choses de la musique, que le champ ouvert au musicien n'est pas un clavier mesquin de sept notes, mais un clavier incommensurable, encore presque tout entier inconnu, ou seulement ca et la, separees par d'epaisses tenebres inexplorees, quelques-unes des millions de touches de tendresse, de passion, de courage, de serenite, qui le composent, chacune aussi differente des autres qu'un univers d'un autre univers, ont ete decouvertes par quelques grands artistes qui nous rendent le service, en eveillant en nous le correspondant du theme qu'ils ont trouve, de nous montrer quelle richesse, quelle variete, cache a notre insu cette grande nuit impenetree et decourageante de notre ame que nous prenons pour du vide et pour du neant. Vinteuil avait ete l'un de ces musiciens. En sa petite phrase, quoiqu'elle presentat a la raison une surface obscure, on sentait un contenu si consistant, si explicite, auquel elle donnait une force si nouvelle, si originale, que ceux qui l'avaient entendue la conservaient en eux de plain-pied avec les idees de l'intelligence. Swann s'y reportait comme a une conception de l'amour et du bonheur dont immediatement il savait aussi bien en quoi elle etait particuliere, qu'il le savait pour la Princesse de Cleves, ou pour Rene, quand leur nom se presentait a sa memoire. Meme quand il ne pensait pas a la petite phrase, elle existait latente dans son esprit au meme titre que certaines autres notions sans equivalent, comme les notions de la lumiere, du son, du relief, de la volupte physique, qui sont les riches possessions dont se diversifie et se pare notre domaine interieur. Peut-etre les perdrons-nous, peut-etre s'effaceront-elles, si nous retournons au neant. Mais tant que nous vivons nous ne pouvons pas plus faire que nous ne les ayons connues que nous ne le pouvons pour quelque objet reel, que nous ne pouvons, par exemple, douter de la lumiere de la lampe qu'on allume devant les objets metamorphoses de notre chambre d'ou s'est echappe jusqu'au souvenir de l'obscurite. Par la, la phrase de Vinteuil avait, comme tel theme de Tristan par exemple, qui nous represente aussi une certaine acquisition sentimentale, epouse notre condition mortelle, pris quelque chose d'humain qui etait assez touchant. Son sort etait lie a l'avenir, a la realite de notre ame dont elle etait un des ornements les plus particuliers, les mieux differencies. Peut-etre est-ce le neant qui est le vrai et tout notre reve est-il inexistant, mais alors nous sentons qu'il faudra que ces phrases musicales, ces notions qui existent par rapport a lui, ne soient rien non plus. Nous perirons mais nous avons pour otages ces captives divines qui suivront notre chance. Et la mort avec elles a quelque chose de moins amer, de moins inglorieux, peut-etre de moins probable. Swann n'avait donc pas tort de croire que la phrase de la sonate existat reellement. Certes, humaine a ce point de vue, elle appartenait pourtant a un ordre de creatures surnaturelles et que nous n'avons jamais vues, mais que",3.936354916771929,1.8783996393360511,0.3270739260230624,0.10329163051929814,4.648820905035054,4.0,2.650144039121403,32.6875,23.5,29.047487161829793,1.3250478011472275,1.0,0.6709038173003202,1569,624,0.3977055449330784,8340,48,24.71848550546357,54337775611.488594,28419338.708937548,0.7199981269684244,0.7042023746863656,61.558143522944576,12.793689053537285,11.578365685549247,15.751864244741874,16.809696462715102,10.62952198852772,55.75952039515615,7.541666666666667,True,53.0,0.8865062761506276,4.361924686192468,1912.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007,0.0112,0.0,0.13859832635983263,81,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"malgre cela nous reconnaissons avec ravissement quand quelque explorateur de l'invisible arrive a en capter une, a l'amener, du monde divin ou il a acces, briller quelques instants au-dessus du notre. C'est ce que Vinteuil avait fait pour la petite phrase. Swann sentait que le compositeur s'etait contente, avec ses instruments de musique, de la devoiler, de la rendre visible, d'en suivre et d'en respecter le dessin d'une main si tendre, si prudente, si delicate et si sure que le son s'alterait a tout moment, s'estompant pour indiquer une ombre, revivifie quand il lui fallait suivre a la piste un plus hardi contour. Et une preuve que Swann ne se trompait pas quand il croyait a l'existence reelle de cette phrase, c'est que tout amateur un peu fin se fut tout de suite apercu de l'imposture, si Vinteuil ayant eu moins de puissance pour en voir et en rendre les formes, avait cherche a dissimuler, en ajoutant ca et la des traits de son cru, les lacunes de sa vision ou les defaillances de sa main. Elle avait disparu. Swann savait qu'elle reparaitrait a la fin du dernier mouvement, apres tout un long morceau que le pianiste de Mme Verdurin sautait toujours. Il y avait la d'admirables idees que Swann n'avait pas distinguees a la premiere audition et qu'il percevait maintenant, comme si elles se fussent, dans le vestiaire de sa memoire, debarrassees du deguisement uniforme de la nouveaute. Swann ecoutait tous les themes epars qui entreraient dans la composition de la phrase, comme les premisses dans la conclusion necessaire, il assistait a sa genese. O audace aussi geniale peut-etre, se disait-il, que celle d'un Lavoisier, d'un Ampere, l'audace d'un Vinteuil experimentant, decouvrant les lois secretes d'une force inconnue, menant a travers l'inexplore, vers le seul but possible, l'attelage invisible auquel il se fie et qu'il n'apercevra jamais. Le beau dialogue que Swann entendit entre le piano et le violon au commencement du dernier morceau! La suppression des mots humains, loin d'y laisser regner la fantaisie, comme on aurait pu croire, l'en avait eliminee; jamais le langage parle ne fut si inflexiblement necessite, ne connut a ce point la pertinence des questions, l'evidence des reponses. D'abord le piano solitaire se plaignit, comme un oiseau abandonne de sa compagne; le violon l'entendit, lui repondit comme d'un arbre voisin. C'etait comme au commencement du monde, comme s'il n'y avait encore eu qu'eux deux sur la terre, ou plutot dans ce monde ferme a tout le reste, construit par la logique d'un createur et ou ils ne seraient jamais que tous les deux: cette sonate. Est-ce un oiseau, est-ce l'ame incomplete encore de la petite phrase, est-ce une fee, invisible et gemissant dont le piano ensuite redisait tendrement la plainte? Ses cris etaient si soudains que le violoniste devait se precipiter sur son archet pour les recueillir. Merveilleux oiseau! le violoniste semblait vouloir le charmer, l'apprivoiser, le capter. Deja il avait passe dans son ame, deja la petite phrase evoquee agitait comme celui d'un medium le corps vraiment possede du violoniste. Swann savait qu'elle allait parler encore une fois. Et il s'etait si bien dedouble que l'attente de l'instant imminent ou il allait se retrouver en face d'elle le secoua d'un de ces sanglots qu'un beau vers ou une triste nouvelle provoquent en nous, non pas quand nous sommes seuls, mais si nous les apprenons a des amis en qui nous nous apercevons comme un autre dont l'emotion probable les attendrit. Elle reparut, mais cette fois pour se suspendre dans l'air et se jouer un instant seulement, comme immobile, et pour expirer apres. Aussi Swann ne perdait-il rien du temps si court ou elle se prorogeait. Elle etait encore la comme une bulle irisee qui se soutient. Tel un arc-en-ciel, dont l'eclat faiblit, s'abaisse, puis se releve et avant de s'eteindre, s'exalte un moment comme il n'avait pas encore fait: aux deux couleurs qu'elle avait jusque-la laisse paraitre, elle ajouta d'autres cordes diaprees, toutes celles du prisme, et les fit chanter. Swann n'osait pas bouger et aurait voulu faire tenir tranquilles aussi les autres personnes, comme si le moindre mouvement avait pu compromettre le prestige surnaturel, delicieux et fragile qui etait si pres de s'evanouir. Personne, a dire vrai, ne songeait a parler. La parole ineffable d'un seul absent, peut-etre d'un mort (Swann ne savait pas si Vinteuil vivait encore) s'exhalant au-dessus des rites de ces officiants, suffisait a tenir en echec l'attention de trois cents personnes, et faisait de cette estrade ou une ame etait ainsi evoquee un des plus nobles autels ou put s'accomplir une ceremonie surnaturelle. De sorte que quand la phrase se fut enfin defaite flottant en lambeaux dans les motifs suivants qui deja avaient pris sa place, si Swann au premier instant fut irrite de voir la comtesse de Monteriender, celebre par ses naivetes, se pencher vers lui pour lui confier ses impressions avant meme que la sonate fut finie, il ne put s'empecher de sourire, et peut-etre de trouver aussi un sens profond qu'elle n'y voyait pas, dans les mots dont elle se servit. Emerveillee par la virtuosite des executants, la comtesse s'ecria en s'adressant a Swann: C'est prodigieux, je n'ai jamais rien vu d'aussi fort... Mais un scrupule d'exactitude lui faisant corriger cette premiere assertion, elle ajouta cette reserve: rien d'aussi fort... depuis les tables tournantes! A partir de cette soiree, Swann comprit que le sentiment qu'Odette avait eu pour lui ne renaitrait jamais, que ses esperances de bonheur ne se realiseraient plus. Et les jours ou par hasard elle avait encore ete gentille et tendre avec lui, si elle avait eu quelque attention, il notait ces signes apparents et menteurs d'un leger retour vers lui, avec cette sollicitude attendrie et sceptique, cette joie desesperee de ceux qui, soignant un ami arrive aux derniers jours d'une maladie incurable, relatent comme des faits precieux hier, il a fait ses comptes lui-meme et c'est lui qui a releve une erreur d'addition que nous avions faite; il a mange un uf avec plaisir, s'il le digere bien on essaiera demain d'une cotelette, quoiqu'ils les sachent denues de signification a la veille d'une mort inevitable. Sans doute Swann etait certain que s'il avait vecu maintenant loin d'Odette, elle aurait fini par lui devenir indifferente, de sorte qu'il aurait ete content qu'elle quittat Paris pour toujours; il aurait eu le courage de rester; mais il n'avait pas celui de partir. Il en avait eu souvent la pensee. Maintenant qu'il s'etait remis a son etude sur Ver Meer il aurait eu besoin de retourner au moins quelques jours a la Haye, a Dresde, a Brunswick. Il etait persuade qu'une Toilette de Diane qui avait ete achetee par le Mauritshuis a la vente Goldschmidt comme un Nicolas Maes etait en realite de Ver Meer. Et il aurait voulu pouvoir etudier le tableau sur place pour etayer sa conviction. Mais quitter Paris pendant qu'Odette y etait et meme quand elle etait absente--car dans des lieux nouveaux ou les sensations ne sont pas amorties par l'habitude, on retrempe, on ranime une douleur--c'etait pour lui un projet si cruel, qu'il ne se sentait capable d'y penser sans cesse que parce qu'il se savait resolu a ne l'executer jamais. Mais il arrivait qu'en dormant, l'intention du voyage renaissait en lui,--sans qu'il se rappelat que ce voyage etait impossible--et elle s'y realisait. Un jour il reva qu'il partait pour un an; penche a la portiere du wagon vers un jeune homme qui sur le quai lui disait adieu en pleurant, Swann cherchait a le convaincre de partir avec lui. Le train s'ebranlant, l'anxiete le reveilla, il se rappela qu'il ne partait pas, qu'il verrait Odette ce soir-la, le lendemain et presque chaque jour. Alors encore tout emu de son reve, il benit les circonstances particulieres qui le rendaient independant, grace auxquelles il pouvait rester pres d'Odette, et aussi reussir a ce qu'elle lui permit de la voir quelquefois; et, recapitulant tous ces avantages: sa situation,--sa fortune, dont elle avait souvent trop besoin pour ne pas reculer devant une rupture (ayant meme, disait-on, une arriere-pensee de se faire epouser par lui),--cette amitie de M. de Charlus, qui a vrai dire ne lui avait jamais fait obtenir grand'chose d'Odette, mais lui donnait la douceur de sentir qu'elle entendait parler de lui d'une maniere flatteuse par cet ami commun pour qui elle avait une si grande estime--et jusqu'a son intelligence enfin, qu'il employait tout entiere a combiner chaque jour une intrigue nouvelle qui rendit sa presence sinon agreable, du moins necessaire a Odette--il songea a ce qu'il serait devenu si tout cela lui avait manque, il songea que s'il avait ete, comme tant d'autres, pauvre, humble, denue, oblige d'accepter toute besogne, ou lie a des parents, a une epouse, il aurait pu etre oblige de quitter Odette, que ce reve dont l'effroi etait encore si proche aurait pu etre vrai, et il se dit: On ne connait pas son bonheur. On n'est jamais aussi malheureux qu'on croit. Mais il compta que cette existence durait deja depuis plusieurs annees, que tout ce qu'il pouvait esperer c'est qu'elle durat toujours, qu'il sacrifierait ses travaux, ses plaisirs, ses amis, finalement toute sa vie a l'attente quotidienne d'un rendez-vous qui ne pouvait rien lui apporter d'heureux, et il se demanda s'il ne se trompait pas, si ce qui avait favorise sa liaison et en avait empeche la rupture n'avait pas desservi sa destinee, si l'evenement desirable, ce n'aurait pas ete celui dont il se rejouissait tant qu'il n'eut eu lieu qu'en reve: son depart; il se dit qu'on ne connait pas son malheur, qu'on n'est jamais si heureux qu'on croit. Quelquefois il esperait qu'elle mourrait sans souffrances dans un accident, elle qui etait dehors, dans les rues, sur les routes, du matin au soir. Et comme elle revenait saine et sauve, il admirait que le corps humain fut si souple et si fort, qu'il put continuellement tenir en echec, dejouer tous les perils qui l'environnent (et",4.256072879260497,1.8134915131703495,0.3176211502688464,0.09836768089374927,4.630967741935484,4.0,2.595146033355982,31.0,24.0,24.890158697766473,1.3419354838709678,1.0,0.6617543611849842,1550,642,0.41419354838709677,8379,50,25.066325336794527,76942585421.63214,40157925.585402995,0.7286156805194154,0.7271457978834709,61.84225806451613,12.334838709677424,11.56386879351177,15.212903225806452,15.88185806451613,10.475251612903225,53.322580645161295,6.92,True,59.0,0.8825678496868476,4.373173277661795,1916.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0035860145432812032,0.004781352724374938,0.0,0.14665970772442588,82,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"que Swann trouvait innombrables depuis que son secret desir les avait supputes), et permit ainsi aux etres de se livrer chaque jour et a peu pres impunement a leur uvre de mensonge, a la poursuite du plaisir. Et Swann sentait bien pres de son cur ce Mahomet II dont il aimait le portrait par Bellini et qui, ayant senti qu'il etait devenu amoureux fou d'une de ses femmes la poignarda afin, dit naivement son biographe venitien, de retrouver sa liberte d'esprit. Puis il s'indignait de ne penser ainsi qu'a soi, et les souffrances qu'il avait eprouvees lui semblaient ne meriter aucune pitie puisque lui-meme faisait si bon marche de la vie d'Odette. Ne pouvant se separer d'elle sans retour, du moins, s'il l'avait vue sans separations, sa douleur aurait fini par s'apaiser et peut-etre son amour par s'eteindre. Et du moment qu'elle ne voulait pas quitter Paris a jamais, il eut souhaite qu'elle ne le quittat jamais. Du moins comme il savait que la seule grande absence qu'elle faisait etait tous les ans celle d'aout et septembre, il avait le loisir plusieurs mois d'avance d'en dissoudre l'idee amere dans tout le Temps a venir qu'il portait en lui par anticipation et qui, compose de jours homogenes aux jours actuels, circulait transparent et froid en son esprit ou il entretenait la tristesse, mais sans lui causer de trop vives souffrances. Mais cet avenir interieur, ce fleuve, incolore, et libre, voici qu'une seule parole d'Odette venait l'atteindre jusqu'en Swann et, comme un morceau de glace, l'immobilisait, durcissait sa fluidite, le faisait geler tout entier; et Swann s'etait senti soudain rempli d'une masse enorme et infrangible qui pesait sur les parois interieures de son etre jusqu'a le faire eclater: c'est qu'Odette lui avait dit, avec un regard souriant et sournois qui l'observait: Forcheville va faire un beau voyage, a la Pentecote. Il va en Egypte, et Swann avait aussitot compris que cela signifiait: Je vais aller en Egypte a la Pentecote avec Forcheville. Et en effet, si quelques jours apres, Swann lui disait: Voyons, a propos de ce voyage que tu m'as dit que tu ferais avec Forcheville, elle repondait etourdiment: Oui, mon petit, nous partons le 19, on t'enverra une vue des Pyramides. Alors il voulait apprendre si elle etait la maitresse de Forcheville, le lui demander a elle-meme. Il savait que, superstitieuse comme elle etait, il y avait certains parjures qu'elle ne ferait pas et puis la crainte, qui l'avait retenu jusqu'ici, d'irriter Odette en l'interrogeant, de se faire detester d'elle, n'existait plus maintenant qu'il avait perdu tout espoir d'en etre jamais aime. Un jour il recut une lettre anonyme, qui lui disait qu'Odette avait ete la maitresse d'innombrables hommes (dont on lui citait quelques-uns parmi lesquels Forcheville, M. de Breaute et le peintre), de femmes, et qu'elle frequentait les maisons de passe. Il fut tourmente de penser qu'il y avait parmi ses amis un etre capable de lui avoir adresse cette lettre (car par certains details elle revelait chez celui qui l'avait ecrite une connaissance familiere de la vie de Swann). Il chercha qui cela pouvait etre. Mais il n'avait jamais eu aucun soupcon des actions inconnues des etres, de celles qui sont sans liens visibles avec leurs propos. Et quand il voulut savoir si c'etait plutot sous le caractere apparent de M. de Charlus, de M. des Laumes, de M. d'Orsan, qu'il devait situer la region inconnue ou cet acte ignoble avait du naitre, comme aucun de ces hommes n'avait jamais approuve devant lui les lettres anonymes et que tout ce qu'ils lui avaient dit impliquait qu'ils les reprouvaient, il ne vit pas de raisons pour relier cette infamie plutot a la nature de l'un que de l'autre. Celle de M. de Charlus etait un peu d'un detraque mais foncierement bonne et tendre; celle de M. des Laumes un peu seche mais saine et droite. Quant a M. d'Orsan, Swann, n'avait jamais rencontre personne qui dans les circonstances meme les plus tristes vint a lui avec une parole plus sentie, un geste plus discret et plus juste. C'etait au point qu'il ne pouvait comprendre le role peu delicat qu'on pretait a M. d'Orsan dans la liaison qu'il avait avec une femme riche, et que chaque fois que Swann pensait a lui il etait oblige de laisser de cote cette mauvaise reputation inconciliable avec tant de temoignages certains de delicatesse. Un instant Swann sentit que son esprit s'obscurcissait et il pensa a autre chose pour retrouver un peu de lumiere. Puis il eut le courage de revenir vers ces reflexions. Mais alors apres n'avoir pu soupconner personne, il lui fallut soupconner tout le monde. Apres tout M. de Charlus l'aimait, avait bon cur. Mais c'etait un nevropathe, peut-etre demain pleurerait-il de le savoir malade, et aujourd'hui par jalousie, par colere, sur quelque idee subite qui s'etait emparee de lui, avait-il desire lui faire du mal. Au fond, cette race d'hommes est la pire de toutes. Certes, le prince des Laumes etait bien loin d'aimer Swann autant que M. de Charlus. Mais a cause de cela meme il n'avait pas avec lui les memes susceptibilites; et puis c'etait une nature froide sans doute, mais aussi incapable de vilenies que de grandes actions. Swann se repentait de ne s'etre pas attache, dans la vie, qu'a de tels etres. Puis il songeait que ce qui empeche les hommes de faire du mal a leur prochain, c'est la bonte, qu'il ne pouvait au fond repondre que de natures analogues a la sienne, comme etait, a l'egard du cur, celle de M. de Charlus. La seule pensee de faire cette peine a Swann eut revolte celui-ci. Mais avec un homme insensible, d'une autre humanite, comme etait le prince des Laumes, comment prevoir a quels actes pouvaient le conduire des mobiles d'une essence differente. Avoir du cur c'est tout, et M. de Charlus en avait. M. d'Orsan n'en manquait pas non plus et ses relations cordiales mais peu intimes avec Swann, nees de l'agrement que, pensant de meme sur tout, ils avaient a causer ensemble, etaient de plus de repos que l'affection exaltee de M. de Charlus, capable de se porter a des actes de passion, bons ou mauvais. S'il y avait quelqu'un par qui Swann s'etait toujours senti compris et delicatement aime, c'etait par M. d'Orsan. Oui, mais cette vie peu honorable qu'il menait? Swann regrettait de n'en avoir pas tenu compte, d'avoir souvent avoue en plaisantant qu'il n'avait jamais eprouve si vivement des sentiments de sympathie et d'estime que dans la societe d'une canaille. Ce n'est pas pour rien, se disait-il maintenant, que depuis que les hommes jugent leur prochain, c'est sur ses actes. Il n'y a que cela qui signifie quelque chose, et nullement ce que nous disons, ce que nous pensons. Charlus et des Laumes peuvent avoir tels ou tels defauts, ce sont d'honnetes gens. Orsan n'en a peut-etre pas, mais ce n'est pas un honnete homme. Il a pu mal agir une fois de plus. Puis Swann soupconna Remi, qui il est vrai n'aurait pu qu'inspirer la lettre, mais cette piste lui parut un instant la bonne. D'abord Loredan avait des raisons d'en vouloir a Odette. Et puis comment ne pas supposer que nos domestiques, vivant dans une situation inferieure a la notre, ajoutant a notre fortune et a nos defauts des richesses et des vices imaginaires pour lesquels ils nous envient et nous meprisent, se trouveront fatalement amenes a agir autrement que des gens de notre monde. Il soupconna aussi mon grand-pere. Chaque fois que Swann lui avait demande un service, ne le lui avait-il pas toujours refuse? puis avec ses idees bourgeoises il avait pu croire agir pour le bien de Swann. Celui-ci soupconna encore Bergotte, le peintre, les Verdurin, admira une fois de plus au passage la sagesse des gens du monde de ne pas vouloir frayer avec ces milieux artistes ou de telles choses sont possibles, peut-etre meme avouees sous le nom de bonnes farces; mais il se rappelait des traits de droiture de ces bohemes, et les rapprocha de la vie d'expedients, presque d'escroqueries, ou le manque d'argent, le besoin de luxe, la corruption des plaisirs conduisent souvent l'aristocratie. Bref cette lettre anonyme prouvait qu'il connaissait un etre capable de sceleratesse, mais il ne voyait pas plus de raison pour que cette sceleratesse fut cachee dans le tuf--inexplore d'autrui--du caractere de l'homme tendre que de l'homme froid, de l'artiste que du bourgeois, du grand seigneur que du valet. Quel criterium adopter pour juger les hommes? au fond il n'y avait pas une seule des personnes qu'il connaissait qui ne put etre capable d'une infamie. Fallait-il cesser de les voir toutes? Son esprit se voila; il passa deux ou trois fois ses mains sur son front, essuya les verres de son lorgnon avec son mouchoir, et, songeant qu'apres tout, des gens qui le valaient frequentaient M. de Charlus, le prince des Laumes, et les autres, il se dit que cela signifiait sinon qu'ils fussent incapables d'infamie, du moins, que c'est une necessite de la vie a laquelle chacun se soumet de frequenter des gens qui n'en sont peut-etre pas incapables. Et il continua a serrer la main a tous ces amis qu'il avait soupconnes, avec cette reserve de pur style qu'ils avaient peut-etre cherche a le desesperer. Quant au fond meme de la lettre, il ne s'en inquieta pas, car pas une des accusations formulees contre Odette n'avait l'ombre de vraisemblance. Swann comme beaucoup de gens avait l'esprit paresseux et manquait d'invention. Il savait bien comme une verite generale que la vie des etres est pleine de contrastes, mais pour chaque etre en particulier il imaginait toute la partie de sa vie qu'il ne connaissait pas comme identique a la partie qu'il connaissait. Il imaginait ce qu'on lui taisait a l'aide de ce qu'on lui disait. Dans les moments ou Odette etait aupres de lui, s'ils parlaient ensemble d'une action indelicate commise, ou d'un sentiment indelicat eprouve, par",3.846690950584802,1.5191187541200115,0.3168770613862478,0.08850099512276874,4.525940337224384,4.0,2.5021990829379774,24.476190476190474,21.0,17.03484490810186,1.284046692607004,1.0,0.5915463416705367,1542,585,0.37937743190661477,8161,63,25.261124030926418,93490347341.8716,49257295.75441074,0.7885938844373149,0.7784383736672948,73.36131647211414,9.107465258476932,9.880844465938662,12.073225866221975,12.125274226422086,9.6031906614786,45.48786362794145,5.142857142857143,True,43.0,0.8856691253951527,4.299789251844047,1898.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.010182262498727217,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004887485999389064,0.010589552998676305,0.006516647999185419,0.13645943097997892,83,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"n'etes pas gaie. On pourrait passer une soiree ensemble. --Mais je crois bien, pourquoi ne viendriez-vous pas a Guermantes, ma belle-mere serait folle de joie. Cela passe pour tres laid, mais je vous dirai que ce pays ne me deplait pas, j'ai horreur des pays pittoresques. --Je crois bien, c'est admirable, repondit Swann, c'est presque trop beau, trop vivant pour moi, en ce moment; c'est un pays pour etre heureux. C'est peut-etre parce que j'y ai vecu, mais les choses m'y parlent tellement. Des qu'il se leve un souffle d'air, que les bles commencent a remuer, il me semble qu'il y a quelqu'un qui va arriver, que je vais recevoir une nouvelle; et ces petites maisons au bord de l'eau... je serais bien malheureux! --Oh! mon petit Charles, prenez garde, voila l'affreuse Rampillon qui m'a vue, cachez-moi, rappelez-moi donc ce qui lui est arrive, je confonds, elle a marie sa fille ou son amant, je ne sais plus; peut-etre les deux... et ensemble! Ah! non, je me rappelle, elle a ete repudiee par son prince... ayez l'air de me parler pour que cette Berenice ne vienne pas m'inviter a diner. Du reste, je me sauve. Ecoutez, mon petit Charles, pour une fois que je vous vois, vous ne voulez pas vous laisser enlever et que je vous emmene chez la princesse de Parme qui serait tellement contente, et Basin aussi qui doit m'y rejoindre. Si on n'avait pas de vos nouvelles par Meme... Pensez que je ne vous vois plus jamais! Swann refusa; ayant prevenu M. de Charlus qu'en quittant de chez Mme de Saint-Euverte il rentrerait directement chez lui, il ne se souciait pas en allant chez la princesse de Parme de risquer de manquer un mot qu'il avait tout le temps espere se voir remettre par un domestique pendant la soiree, et que peut-etre il allait trouver chez son concierge. Ce pauvre Swann, dit ce soir-la Mme des Laumes a son mari, il est toujours gentil, mais il a l'air bien malheureux. Vous le verrez, car il a promis de venir diner un de ces jours. Je trouve ridicule au fond qu'un homme de son intelligence souffre pour une personne de ce genre et qui n'est meme pas interessante, car on la dit idiote, ajouta-t-elle avec la sagesse des gens non amoureux qui trouvent qu'un homme d'esprit ne devrait etre malheureux que pour une personne qui en valut la peine; c'est a peu pres comme s'etonner qu'on daigne souffrir du cholera par le fait d'un etre aussi petit que le bacille virgule. Swann voulait partir, mais au moment ou il allait enfin s'echapper, le general de Froberville lui demanda a connaitre Mme de Cambremer et il fut oblige de rentrer avec lui dans le salon pour la chercher. --Dites donc, Swann, j'aimerais mieux etre le mari de cette femme-la que d'etre massacre par les sauvages, qu'en dites-vous? Ces mots massacre par les sauvages percerent douloureusement le cur de Swann; aussitot il eprouva le besoin de continuer la conversation avec le general: --Ah! lui dit-il, il y a eu de bien belles vies qui ont fini de cette facon... Ainsi vous savez... ce navigateur dont Dumont d'Urville ramena les cendres, La Perouse...(et Swann etait deja heureux comme s'il avait parle d'Odette.) C'est un beau caractere et qui m'interesse beaucoup que celui de La Perouse, ajouta-t-il d'un air melancolique. --Ah! parfaitement, La Perouse, dit le general. C'est un nom connu. Il a sa rue. --Vous connaissez quelqu'un rue La Perouse? demanda Swann d'un air agite. --Je ne connais que Mme de Chanlivault, la sur de ce brave Chaussepierre. Elle nous a donne une jolie soiree de comedie l'autre jour. C'est un salon qui sera un jour tres elegant, vous verrez! --Ah! elle demeure rue La Perouse. C'est sympathique, c'est une jolie rue, si triste. --Mais non; c'est que vous n'y etes pas alle depuis quelque temps; ce n'est plus triste, cela commence a se construire, tout ce quartier-la. Quand enfin Swann presenta M. de Froberville a la jeune Mme de Cambremer, comme c'etait la premiere fois qu'elle entendait le nom du general, elle esquissa le sourire de joie et de surprise qu'elle aurait eu si on n'en avait jamais prononce devant elle d'autre que celui-la, car ne connaissant pas les amis de sa nouvelle famille, a chaque personne qu'on lui amenait, elle croyait que c'etait l'un d'eux, et pensant qu'elle faisait preuve de tact en ayant l'air d'en avoir tant entendu parler depuis qu'elle etait mariee, elle tendait la main d'un air hesitant destine a prouver la reserve apprise qu'elle avait a vaincre et la sympathie spontanee qui reussissait a en triompher. Aussi ses beaux-parents, qu'elle croyait encore les gens les plus brillants de France, declaraient-ils qu'elle etait un ange; d'autant plus qu'ils preferaient paraitre, en la faisant epouser a leur fils, avoir cede a l'attrait plutot de ses qualites que de sa grande fortune. --On voit que vous etes musicienne dans l'ame, madame, lui dit le general en faisant inconsciemment allusion a l'incident de la bobeche. Mais le concert recommenca et Swann comprit qu'il ne pourrait pas s'en aller avant la fin de ce nouveau numero du programme. Il souffrait de rester enferme au milieu de ces gens dont la betise et les ridicules le frappaient d'autant plus douloureusement qu'ignorant son amour, incapables, s'ils l'avaient connu, de s'y interesser et de faire autre chose que d'en sourire comme d'un enfantillage ou de le deplorer comme une folie, ils le lui faisaient apparaitre sous l'aspect d'un etat subjectif qui n'existait que pour lui, dont rien d'exterieur ne lui affirmait la realite; il souffrait surtout, et au point que meme le son des instruments lui donnait envie de crier, de prolonger son exil dans ce lieu ou Odette ne viendrait jamais, ou personne, ou rien ne la connaissait, d'ou elle etait entierement absente. Mais tout a coup ce fut comme si elle etait entree, et cette apparition lui fut une si dechirante souffrance qu'il dut porter la main a son cur. C'est que le violon etait monte a des notes hautes ou il restait comme pour une attente, une attente qui se prolongeait sans qu'il cessat de les tenir, dans l'exaltation ou il etait d'apercevoir deja l'objet de son attente qui s'approchait, et avec un effort desespere pour tacher de durer jusqu'a son arrivee, de l'accueillir avant d'expirer, de lui maintenir encore un moment de toutes ses dernieres forces le chemin ouvert pour qu'il put passer, comme on soutient une porte qui sans cela retomberait. Et avant que Swann eut eu le temps de comprendre, et de se dire: C'est la petite phrase de la sonate de Vinteuil, n'ecoutons pas! tous ses souvenirs du temps ou Odette etait eprise de lui, et qu'il avait reussi jusqu'a ce jour a maintenir invisibles dans les profondeurs de son etre, trompes par ce brusque rayon du temps d'amour qu'ils crurent revenu, s'etaient reveilles, et a tire d'aile, etaient remontes lui chanter eperdument, sans pitie pour son infortune presente, les refrains oublies du bonheur. Au lieu des expressions abstraites temps ou j'etais heureux, temps ou j'etais aime, qu'il avait souvent prononcees jusque-la et sans trop souffrir, car son intelligence n'y avait enferme du passe que de pretendus extraits qui n'en conservaient rien, il retrouva tout ce qui de ce bonheur perdu avait fixe a jamais la specifique et volatile essence; il revit tout, les petales neigeux et frises du chrysantheme qu'elle lui avait jete dans sa voiture, qu'il avait garde contre ses levres--l'adresse en relief de la Maison Doree sur la lettre ou il avait lu: Ma main tremble si fort en vous ecrivant--le rapprochement de ses sourcils quand elle lui avait dit d'un air suppliant: Ce n'est pas dans trop longtemps que vous me ferez signe? , il sentit l'odeur du fer du coiffeur par lequel il se faisait relever sa brosse pendant que Loredan allait chercher la petite ouvriere, les pluies d'orage qui tomberent si souvent ce printemps-la, le retour glacial dans sa victoria, au clair de lune, toutes les mailles d'habitudes mentales, d'impressions saisonnieres, de creations cutanees, qui avaient etendu sur une suite de semaines un reseau uniforme dans lequel son corps se trouvait repris. A ce moment-la, il satisfaisait une curiosite voluptueuse en connaissant les plaisirs des gens qui vivent par l'amour. Il avait cru qu'il pourrait s'en tenir la, qu'il ne serait pas oblige d'en apprendre les douleurs; comme maintenant le charme d'Odette lui etait peu de chose aupres de cette formidable terreur qui le prolongeait comme un trouble halo, cette immense angoisse de ne pas savoir a tous moments ce qu'elle avait fait, de ne pas la posseder partout et toujours! Helas, il se rappela l'accent dont elle s'etait ecriee: Mais je pourrai toujours vous voir, je suis toujours libre! elle qui ne l'etait plus jamais! l'interet, la curiosite qu'elle avait eus pour sa vie a lui, le desir passionne qu'il lui fit la faveur,--redoutee au contraire par lui en ce temps-la comme une cause d'ennuyeux derangements--de l'y laisser penetrer; comme elle avait ete obligee de le prier pour qu'il se laissat mener chez les Verdurin; et, quand il la faisait venir chez lui une fois par mois, comme il avait fallu, avant qu'il se laissat flechir, qu'elle lui repetat le delice que serait cette habitude de se voir tous les jours dont elle revait alors qu'elle ne lui semblait a lui qu'un fastidieux tracas, puis qu'elle avait prise en degout et definitivement rompue, pendant qu'elle etait devenue pour lui un si invincible et si douloureux besoin. Il ne savait pas dire si vrai quand, a la troisieme fois qu'il l'avait vue, comme elle lui repetait: Mais pourquoi ne me laissez-vous pas venir plus souvent, il lui avait dit en riant, avec galanterie: par peur de souffrir. Maintenant, helas! il arrivait encore parfois qu'elle lui ecrivit d'un restaurant ou d'un hotel sur du papier qui en portait le nom imprime; mais c'etait comme des lettres de feu qui le brulaient.",3.6835304340840445,2.2139729193620883,0.3458724950259752,0.10927529980136268,4.499676793794441,4.0,2.534155795703022,25.360655737704917,17.0,30.384439927929268,1.3154492566257272,1.0,0.618639980270046,1547,622,0.40206851971557855,8144,61,23.44053349260318,15138900991.672918,7843990.151125864,0.6249963420753678,0.6305596167695219,69.806927315693,9.822956965888501,10.552427663962934,12.807481428889336,12.443805567624274,9.490937297996119,47.01547151016775,5.491803278688525,True,52.0,0.877720207253886,4.219689119170985,1930.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.007547939616483068,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0036719706242350062,0.0027539779681762548,0.0,0.12642487046632125,80,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"un autre, elle les fletrissait en vertu des memes principes que Swann avait toujours entendu professer par ses parents et auxquels il etait reste fidele; et puis elle arrangeait ses fleurs, elle buvait une tasse de the, elle s'inquietait des travaux de Swann. Donc Swann etendait ces habitudes au reste de la vie d'Odette, il repetait ces gestes quand il voulait se representer les moments ou elle etait loin de lui. Si on la lui avait depeinte telle qu'elle etait, ou plutot qu'elle avait ete si longtemps avec lui, mais aupres d'un autre homme, il eut souffert, car cette image lui eut paru vraisemblable. Mais qu'elle allat chez des maquerelles, se livrat a des orgies avec des femmes, qu'elle menat la vie crapuleuse de creatures abjectes, quelle divagation insensee a la realisation de laquelle, Dieu merci, les chrysanthemes imagines, les thes successifs, les indignations vertueuses ne laissaient aucune place. Seulement de temps a autre, il laissait entendre a Odette que par mechancete, on lui racontait tout ce qu'elle faisait; et, se servant a propos, d'un detail insignifiant mais vrai, qu'il avait appris par hasard, comme s'il etait le seul petit bout qu'il laissat passer malgre lui, entre tant d'autres, d'une reconstitution complete de la vie d'Odette qu'il tenait cachee en lui, il l'amenait a supposer qu'il etait renseigne sur des choses qu'en realite il ne savait ni meme ne soupconnait, car si bien souvent il adjurait Odette de ne pas alterer la verite, c'etait seulement, qu'il s'en rendit compte ou non, pour qu'Odette lui dit tout ce qu'elle faisait. Sans doute, comme il le disait a Odette, il aimait la sincerite, mais il l'aimait comme une proxenete pouvant le tenir au courant de la vie de sa maitresse. Aussi son amour de la sincerite n'etant pas desinteresse, ne l'avait pas rendu meilleur. La verite qu'il cherissait c'etait celle que lui dirait Odette; mais lui-meme, pour obtenir cette verite, ne craignait pas de recourir au mensonge, le mensonge qu'il ne cessait de peindre a Odette comme conduisant a la degradation toute creature humaine. En somme il mentait autant qu'Odette parce que plus malheureux qu'elle, il n'etait pas moins egoiste. Et elle, entendant Swann lui raconter ainsi a elle-meme des choses qu'elle avait faites, le regardait d'un air mefiant, et, a toute aventure, fache, pour ne pas avoir l'air de s'humilier et de rougir de ses actes. Un jour, etant dans la periode de calme la plus longue qu'il eut encore pu traverser sans etre repris d'acces de jalousie, il avait accepte d'aller le soir au theatre avec la princesse des Laumes. Ayant ouvert le journal, pour chercher ce qu'on jouait, la vue du titre: Les Filles de Marbre de Theodore Barriere le frappa si cruellement qu'il eut un mouvement de recul et detourna la tete. Eclaire comme par la lumiere de la rampe, a la place nouvelle ou il figurait, ce mot de marbre qu'il avait perdu la faculte de distinguer tant il avait l'habitude de l'avoir souvent sous les yeux, lui etait soudain redevenu visible et l'avait aussitot fait souvenir de cette histoire qu'Odette lui avait racontee autrefois, d'une visite qu'elle avait faite au Salon du Palais de l'Industrie avec Mme Verdurin et ou celle-ci lui avait dit: Prends garde, je saurai bien te degeler, tu n'es pas de marbre. Odette lui avait affirme que ce n'etait qu'une plaisanterie, et il n'y avait attache aucune importance. Mais il avait alors plus de confiance en elle qu'aujourd'hui. Et justement la lettre anonyme parlait d'amour de ce genre. Sans oser lever les yeux vers le journal, il le deplia, tourna une feuille pour ne plus voir ce mot: Les Filles de Marbre et commenca a lire machinalement les nouvelles des departements. Il y avait eu une tempete dans la Manche, on signalait des degats a Dieppe, a Cabourg, a Beuzeval. Aussitot il fit un nouveau mouvement en arriere. Le nom de Beuzeval l'avait fait penser a celui d'une autre localite de cette region, Beuzeville, qui porte uni a celui-la par un trait d'union, un autre nom, celui de Breaute, qu'il avait vu souvent sur les cartes, mais dont pour la premiere fois il remarquait que c'etait le meme que celui de son ami M. de Breaute dont la lettre anonyme disait qu'il avait ete l'amant d'Odette. Apres tout, pour M. de Breaute, l'accusation n'etait pas invraisemblable; mais en ce qui concernait Mme Verdurin, il y avait impossibilite. De ce qu'Odette mentait quelquefois, on ne pouvait conclure qu'elle ne disait jamais la verite et dans ces propos qu'elle avait echanges avec Mme Verdurin et qu'elle avait racontes elle-meme a Swann, il avait reconnu ces plaisanteries inutiles et dangereuses que, par inexperience de la vie et ignorance du vice, tiennent des femmes dont ils revelent l'innocence, et qui--comme par exemple Odette--sont plus eloignees qu'aucune d'eprouver une tendresse exaltee pour une autre femme. Tandis qu'au contraire, l'indignation avec laquelle elle avait repousse les soupcons qu'elle avait involontairement fait naitre un instant en lui par son recit, cadrait avec tout ce qu'il savait des gouts, du temperament de sa maitresse. Mais a ce moment, par une de ces inspirations de jaloux, analogues a celle qui apporte au poete ou au savant, qui n'a encore qu'une rime ou qu'une observation, l'idee ou la loi qui leur donnera toute leur puissance, Swann se rappela pour la premiere fois une phrase qu'Odette lui avait dite il y avait deja deux ans: Oh! Mme Verdurin, en ce moment il n'y en a que pour moi, je suis un amour, elle m'embrasse, elle veut que je fasse des courses avec elle, elle veut que je la tutoie. Loin de voir alors dans cette phrase un rapport quelconque avec les absurdes propos destines a simuler le vice que lui avait racontes Odette, il l'avait accueillie comme la preuve d'une chaleureuse amitie. Maintenant voila que le souvenir de cette tendresse de Mme Verdurin etait venu brusquement rejoindre le souvenir de sa conversation de mauvais gout. Il ne pouvait plus les separer dans son esprit, et les vit melees aussi dans la realite, la tendresse donnant quelque chose de serieux et d'important a ces plaisanteries qui en retour lui faisaient perdre de son innocence. Il alla chez Odette. Il s'assit loin d'elle. Il n'osait l'embrasser, ne sachant si en elle, si en lui, c'etait l'affection ou la colere qu'un baiser reveillerait. Il se taisait, il regardait mourir leur amour. Tout a coup il prit une resolution. --Odette, lui dit-il, mon cheri, je sais bien que je suis odieux, mais il faut que je te demande des choses. Tu te souviens de l'idee que j'avais eue a propos de toi et de Mme Verdurin? Dis-moi si c'etait vrai, avec elle ou avec une autre. Elle secoua la tete en froncant la bouche, signe frequemment employe par les gens pour repondre qu'ils n'iront pas, que cela les ennuie a quelqu'un qui leur a demande: Viendrez-vous voir passer la cavalcade, assisterez-vous a la Revue? Mais ce hochement de tete affecte ainsi d'habitude a un evenement a venir mele a cause de cela de quelque incertitude la denegation d'un evenement passe. De plus il n'evoque que des raisons de convenance personnelle plutot que la reprobation, qu'une impossibilite morale. En voyant Odette lui faire ainsi le signe que c'etait faux, Swann comprit que c'etait peut-etre vrai. --Je te l'ai dit, tu le sais bien, ajouta-t-elle d'un air irrite et malheureux. --Oui, je sais, mais en es-tu sure? Ne me dis pas: Tu le sais bien, dis-moi: Je n'ai jamais fait ce genre de choses avec aucune femme. Elle repeta comme une lecon, sur un ton ironique et comme si elle voulait se debarrasser de lui: --Je n'ai jamais fait ce genre de choses avec aucune femme. --Peux-tu me le jurer sur ta medaille de Notre-Dame de Laghet? Swann savait qu'Odette ne se parjurerait pas sur cette medaille-la. --Oh! que tu me rends malheureuse, s'ecria-t-elle en se derobant par un sursaut a l'etreinte de sa question. Mais as-tu bientot fini? Qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui? Tu as donc decide qu'il fallait que je te deteste, que je t'execre? Voila, je voulais reprendre avec toi le bon temps comme autrefois et voila ton remerciement! Mais, ne la lachant pas, comme un chirurgien attend la fin du spasme qui interrompt son intervention mais ne l'y fait pas renoncer: --Tu as bien tort de te figurer que je t'en voudrais le moins du monde, Odette, lui dit-il avec une douceur persuasive et menteuse. Je ne te parle jamais que de ce que je sais, et j'en sais toujours bien plus long que je ne dis. Mais toi seule peux adoucir par ton aveu ce qui me fait te hair tant que cela ne m'a ete denonce que par d'autres. Ma colere contre toi ne vient pas de tes actions, je te pardonne tout puisque je t'aime, mais de ta faussete, de ta faussete absurde qui te fait perseverer a nier des choses que je sais. Mais comment veux-tu que je puisse continuer a t'aimer, quand je te vois me soutenir, me jurer une chose que je sais fausse. Odette, ne prolonge pas cet instant qui est une torture pour nous deux. Si tu le veux ce sera fini dans une seconde, tu seras pour toujours delivree. Dis-moi sur ta medaille, si oui ou non, tu as jamais fais ces choses. --Mais je n'en sais rien, moi, s'ecria-t-elle avec colere, peut-etre il y a tres longtemps, sans me rendre compte de ce que je faisais, peut-etre deux ou trois fois. Swann avait envisage toutes les possibilites. La realite est donc quelque chose qui n'a aucun rapport avec les possibilites, pas plus qu'un coup de couteau que nous recevons avec les legers mouvements des nuages au-dessus de notre tete, puisque ces mots: deux ou trois fois marquerent a vif une sorte de croix dans son cur. Chose etrange que ces mots deux ou trois fois, rien que des mots, des mots prononces dans l'air, a distance,",3.667708757749232,1.5998846700621216,0.3316499889473683,0.0928937623582486,4.411877394636015,4.0,2.5289308237681603,23.029411764705884,17.0,20.572662177407764,1.2822477650063857,1.0,0.6102814750935724,1566,585,0.3735632183908046,8023,68,27.30263880541174,720087669984.8484,371370639.4970853,0.7543711199689267,0.7312775267796083,74.98198613928331,8.521994215310645,9.478462496947788,11.357358575614155,10.864648411088574,8.856526181353761,42.569641649763355,4.5,True,58.0,0.8741619391438886,4.137699845281073,1939.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.025198802024166064,0.014458329030259218,0.01115356810905711,0.01115356810905711,0.01115356810905711,0.01115356810905711,0.008055354745430135,0.00371785603635237,0.0021687493545388824,0.13512119649303764,84,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"retard, il y a toujours moyen de s'arranger. Et sous tous les souvenirs les plus doux de Swann, sous les paroles les plus simples que lui avait dites autrefois Odette, qu'il avait crues comme paroles d'evangile, sous les actions quotidiennes qu'elle lui avait racontees, sous les lieux les plus accoutumes, la maison de sa couturiere, l'avenue du Bois, l'Hippodrome, il sentait (dissimulee a la faveur de cet excedent de temps qui dans les journees les plus detaillees laisse encore du jeu, de la place, et peut servir de cachette a certaines actions), il sentait s'insinuer la presence possible et souterraine de mensonges qui lui rendaient ignoble tout ce qui lui etait reste le plus cher, ses meilleurs soirs, la rue La Perouse elle-meme, qu'Odette avait toujours du quitter a d'autres heures que celles qu'elle lui avait dites, faisant circuler partout un peu de la tenebreuse horreur qu'il avait ressentie en entendant l'aveu relatif a la Maison Doree, et, comme les betes immondes dans la Desolation de Ninive, ebranlant pierre a pierre tout son passe. Si maintenant il se detournait chaque fois que sa memoire lui disait le nom cruel de la Maison Doree, ce n'etait plus comme tout recemment encore a la soiree de Mme de Saint-Euverte, parce qu'il lui rappelait un bonheur qu'il avait perdu depuis longtemps, mais un malheur qu'il venait seulement d'apprendre. Puis il en fut du nom de la Maison Doree comme de celui de l'Ile du Bois, il cessa peu a peu de faire souffrir Swann. Car ce que nous croyons notre amour, notre jalousie, n'est pas une meme passion continue, indivisible. Ils se composent d'une infinite d'amours successifs, de jalousies differentes et qui sont ephemeres, mais par leur multitude ininterrompue donnent l'impression de la continuite, l'illusion de l'unite. La vie de l'amour de Swann, la fidelite de sa jalousie, etaient faites de la mort, de l'infidelite, d'innombrables desirs, d'innombrables doutes, qui avaient tous Odette pour objet. S'il etait reste longtemps sans la voir, ceux qui mouraient n'auraient pas ete remplaces par d'autres. Mais la presence d'Odette continuait d'ensemencer le cur de Swann de tendresse et de soupcons alternes. Certains soirs elle redevenait tout d'un coup avec lui d'une gentillesse dont elle l'avertissait durement qu'il devait profiter tout de suite, sous peine de ne pas la voir se renouveler avant des annees; il fallait rentrer immediatement chez elle faire catleya et ce desir qu'elle pretendait avoir de lui etait si soudain, si inexplicable, si imperieux, les caresses qu'elle lui prodiguait ensuite si demonstratives et si insolites, que cette tendresse brutale et sans vraisemblance faisait autant de chagrin a Swann qu'un mensonge et qu'une mechancete. Un soir qu'il etait ainsi, sur l'ordre qu'elle lui en avait donne, rentre avec elle, et qu'elle entremelait ses baisers de paroles passionnees qui contrastaient avec sa secheresse ordinaire, il crut tout d'un coup entendre du bruit; il se leva, chercha partout, ne trouva personne, mais n'eut pas le courage de reprendre sa place aupres d'elle qui alors, au comble de la rage, brisa un vase et dit a Swann: On ne peut jamais rien faire avec toi! Et il resta incertain si elle n'avait pas cache quelqu'un dont elle avait voulu faire souffrir la jalousie ou allumer les sens. Quelquefois il allait dans des maisons de rendez-vous, esperant apprendre quelque chose d'elle, sans oser la nommer cependant. J'ai une petite qui va vous plaire, disait l'entremetteuse. Et il restait une heure a causer tristement avec quelque pauvre fille etonnee qu'il ne fit rien de plus. Une toute jeune et ravissante lui dit un jour: Ce que je voudrais, c'est trouver un ami, alors il pourrait etre sur, je n'irais plus jamais avec personne. --Vraiment, crois-tu que ce soit possible qu'une femme soit touchee qu'on l'aime, ne vous trompe jamais? lui demanda Swann anxieusement. Pour sur! ca depend des caracteres! Swann ne pouvait s'empecher de dire a ces filles les memes choses qui auraient plu a la princesse des Laumes. A celle qui cherchait un ami, il dit en souriant: C'est gentil, tu as mis des yeux bleus de la couleur de ta ceinture. --Vous aussi, vous avez des manchettes bleues.--Comme nous avons une belle conversation, pour un endroit de ce genre! Je ne t'ennuie pas, tu as peut-etre a faire? --Non, j'ai tout mon temps. Si vous m'aviez ennuyee, je vous l'aurais dit. Au contraire j'aime bien vous entendre causer.--Je suis tres flatte. N'est-ce pas que nous causons gentiment? dit-il a l'entremetteuse qui venait d'entrer. --Mais oui, c'est justement ce que je me disais. Comme ils sont sages! Voila! on vient maintenant pour causer chez moi. Le Prince le disait, l'autre jour, c'est bien mieux ici que chez sa femme. Il parait que maintenant dans le monde elles ont toutes un genre, c'est un vrai scandale! Je vous quitte, je suis discrete. Et elle laissa Swann avec la fille qui avait les yeux bleus. Mais bientot il se leva et lui dit adieu, elle lui etait indifferente, elle ne connaissait pas Odette. Le peintre ayant ete malade, le docteur Cottard lui conseilla un voyage en mer; plusieurs fideles parlerent de partir avec lui; les Verdurin ne purent se resoudre a rester seuls, louerent un yacht, puis s'en rendirent acquereurs et ainsi Odette fit de frequentes croisieres. Chaque fois qu'elle etait partie depuis un peu de temps, Swann sentait qu'il commencait a se detacher d'elle, mais comme si cette distance morale etait proportionnee a la distance materielle, des qu'il savait Odette de retour, il ne pouvait pas rester sans la voir. Une fois, partis pour un mois seulement, croyaient-ils, soit qu'ils eussent ete tentes en route, soit que M. Verdurin eut sournoisement arrange les choses d'avance pour faire plaisir a sa femme et n'eut averti les fideles qu'au fur et a mesure, d'Alger ils allerent a Tunis, puis en Italie, puis en Grece, a Constantinople, en Asie Mineure. Le voyage durait depuis pres d'un an. Swann se sentait absolument tranquille, presque heureux. Bien que M. Verdurin eut cherche a persuader au pianiste et au docteur Cottard que la tante de l'un et les malades de l'autre n'avaient aucun besoin d'eux, et, qu'en tous cas, il etait imprudent de laisser Mme Cottard rentrer a Paris que Mme Verdurin assurait etre en revolution, il fut oblige de leur rendre leur liberte a Constantinople. Et le peintre partit avec eux. Un jour, peu apres le retour de ces trois voyageurs, Swann voyant passer un omnibus pour le Luxembourg ou il avait a faire, avait saute dedans, et s'y etait trouve assis en face de Mme Cottard qui faisait sa tournee de visites de jours en grande tenue, plumet au chapeau, robe de soie, manchon, en-tout-cas, porte-cartes et gants blancs nettoyes. Revetue de ces insignes, quand il faisait sec, elle allait a pied d'une maison a l'autre, dans un meme quartier, mais pour passer ensuite dans un quartier different usait de l'omnibus avec correspondance. Pendant les premiers instants, avant que la gentillesse native de la femme eut pu percer l'empese de la petite bourgeoise, et ne sachant trop d'ailleurs si elle devait parler des Verdurin a Swann, elle tint tout naturellement, de sa voix lente, gauche et douce que par moments l'omnibus couvrait completement de son tonnerre, des propos choisis parmi ceux qu'elle entendait et repetait dans les vingt-cinq maisons dont elle montait les etages dans une journee: --Je ne vous demande pas, monsieur, si un homme dans le mouvement comme vous, a vu, aux Mirlitons, le portrait de Machard qui fait courir tout Paris. Eh bien! qu'en dites-vous? Etes-vous dans le camp de ceux qui approuvent ou dans le camp de ceux qui blament? Dans tous les salons on ne parle que du portrait de Machard, on n'est pas chic, on n'est pas pur, on n'est pas dans le train, si on ne donne pas son opinion sur le portrait de Machard. Swann ayant repondu qu'il n'avait pas vu ce portrait, Mme Cottard eut peur de l'avoir blesse en l'obligeant a le confesser. --Ah! c'est tres bien, au moins vous l'avouez franchement, vous ne vous croyez pas deshonore parce que vous n'avez pas vu le portrait de Machard. Je trouve cela tres beau de votre part. He bien, moi je l'ai vu, les avis sont partages, il y en a qui trouvent que c'est un peu leche, un peu creme fouettee, moi, je le trouve ideal. Evidemment elle ne ressemble pas aux femmes bleues et jaunes de notre ami Biche. Mais je dois vous l'avouer franchement, vous ne me trouverez pas tres fin de siecle, mais je le dis comme je le pense, je ne comprends pas. Mon Dieu je reconnais les qualites qu'il y a dans le portrait de mon mari, c'est moins etrange que ce qu'il fait d'habitude mais il a fallu qu'il lui fasse des moustaches bleues. Tandis que Machard! Tenez justement le mari de l'amie chez qui je vais en ce moment (ce qui me donne le tres grand plaisir de faire route avec vous) lui a promis s'il est nomme a l'Academie (c'est un des collegues du docteur) de lui faire faire son portrait par Machard. Evidemment c'est un beau reve! j'ai une autre amie qui pretend qu'elle aime mieux Leloir. Je ne suis qu'une pauvre profane et Leloir est peut-etre encore superieur comme science. Mais je trouve que la premiere qualite d'un portrait, surtout quand il coute 10.000 francs, est d'etre ressemblant et d'une ressemblance agreable. Ayant tenu ces propos que lui inspiraient la hauteur de son aigrette, le chiffre de son porte-cartes, le petit numero trace a l'encre dans ses gants par le teinturier, et l'embarras de parler a Swann des Verdurin, Mme Cottard, voyant qu'on etait encore loin du coin de la rue Bonaparte ou le conducteur devait l'arreter, ecouta son cur qui lui conseillait d'autres paroles. --Les oreilles ont du vous tinter, monsieur, lui dit-elle, pendant le voyage que nous avons fait avec Mme Verdurin.

"pas comment il pourrait jamais sortir. Pauvre Odette! il ne lui en voulait pas. Elle n'etait qu'a demi coupable. Ne disait-on pas que c'etait par sa propre mere qu'elle avait ete livree, presque enfant, a Nice, a un riche Anglais. Mais quelle verite douloureuse prenait pour lui ces lignes du Journal d'un Poete d'Alfred de Vigny qu'il avait lues avec indifference autrefois: Quand on se sent pris d'amour pour une femme, on devrait se dire: Comment est-elle entouree? Quelle a ete sa vie? Tout le bonheur de la vie est appuye la-dessus. Swann s'etonnait que de simples phrases epelees par sa pensee, comme Cette blague! , Je voyais bien ou elle voulait en venir pussent lui faire si mal. Mais il comprenait que ce qu'il croyait de simples phrases n'etait que les pieces de l'armature entre lesquelles tenait, pouvait lui etre rendue, la souffrance qu'il avait eprouvee pendant le recit d'Odette. Car c'etait bien cette souffrance-la qu'il eprouvait de nouveau. Il avait beau savoir maintenant,--meme, il eut beau, le temps passant, avoir un peu oublie, avoir pardonne--, au moment ou il se redisait ses mots, la souffrance ancienne le refaisait tel qu'il etait avant qu'Odette ne parlat: ignorant, confiant; sa cruelle jalousie le replacait pour le faire frapper par l'aveu d'Odette dans la position de quelqu'un qui ne sait pas encore, et au bout de plusieurs mois cette vieille histoire le bouleversait toujours comme une revelation. Il admirait la terrible puissance recreatrice de sa memoire. Ce n'est que de l'affaiblissement de cette generatrice dont la fecondite diminue avec l'age qu'il pouvait esperer un apaisement a sa torture. Mais quand paraissait un peu epuise le pouvoir qu'avait de le faire souffrir un des mots prononces par Odette, alors un de ceux sur lesquels l'esprit de Swann s'etait moins arrete jusque-la, un mot presque nouveau venait relayer les autres et le frappait avec une vigueur intacte. La memoire du soir ou il avait dine chez la princesse des Laumes lui etait douloureuse, mais ce n'etait que le centre de son mal. Celui-ci irradiait confusement a l'entour dans tous les jours avoisinants. Et a quelque point d'elle qu'il voulut toucher dans ses souvenirs, c'est la saison tout entiere ou les Verdurin avaient si souvent dine dans l'ile du Bois qui lui faisait mal. Si mal que peu a peu les curiosites qu'excitait en lui sa jalousie furent neutralisees par la peur des tortures nouvelles qu'il s'infligerait en les satisfaisant. Il se rendait compte que toute la periode de la vie d'Odette ecoulee avant qu'elle ne le rencontrat, periode qu'il n'avait jamais cherche a se representer, n'etait pas l'etendue abstraite qu'il voyait vaguement, mais avait ete faite d'annees particulieres, remplie d'incidents concrets. Mais en les apprenant, il craignait que ce passe incolore, fluide et supportable, ne prit un corps tangible et immonde, un visage individuel et diabolique. Et il continuait a ne pas chercher a le concevoir non plus par paresse de penser, mais par peur de souffrir. Il esperait qu'un jour il finirait par pouvoir entendre le nom de l'ile du Bois, de la princesse des Laumes, sans ressentir le dechirement ancien, et trouvait imprudent de provoquer Odette a lui fournir de nouvelles paroles, le nom d'endroits, de circonstances differentes qui, son mal a peine calme, le feraient renaitre sous une autre forme. Mais souvent les choses qu'il ne connaissait pas, qu'il redoutait maintenant de connaitre, c'est Odette elle-meme qui les lui revelait spontanement, et sans s'en rendre compte; en effet l'ecart que le vice mettait entre la vie reelle d'Odette et la vie relativement innocente que Swann avait cru, et bien souvent croyait encore, que menait sa maitresse, cet ecart Odette en ignorait l'etendue: un etre vicieux, affectant toujours la meme vertu devant les etres de qui il ne veut pas que soient soupconnes ses vices, n'a pas de controle pour se rendre compte combien ceux-ci, dont la croissance continue est insensible pour lui-meme l'entrainent peu a peu loin des facons de vivre normales. Dans leur cohabitation, au sein de l'esprit d'Odette, avec le souvenir des actions qu'elle cachait a Swann, d'autres peu a peu en recevaient le reflet, etaient contagionnees par elles, sans qu'elle put leur trouver rien d'etrange, sans qu'elles detonassent dans le milieu particulier ou elle les faisait vivre en elle; mais si elle les racontait a Swann, il etait epouvante par la revelation de l'ambiance qu'elles trahissaient. Un jour il cherchait, sans blesser Odette, a lui demander si elle n'avait jamais ete chez des entremetteuses. A vrai dire il etait convaincu que non; la lecture de la lettre anonyme en avait introduit la supposition dans son intelligence, mais d'une facon mecanique; elle n'y avait rencontre aucune creance, mais en fait y etait restee, et Swann, pour etre debarrasse de la presence purement materielle mais pourtant genante du soupcon, souhaitait qu'Odette l'extirpat. Oh! non! Ce n'est pas que je ne sois pas persecutee pour cela, ajouta-t-elle, en devoilant dans un sourire une satisfaction de vanite qu'elle ne s'apercevait plus ne pas pouvoir paraitre legitime a Swann. Il y en a une qui est encore restee plus de deux heures hier a m'attendre, elle me proposait n'importe quel prix. Il parait qu'il y a un ambassadeur qui lui a dit: Je me tue si vous ne me l'amenez pas. On lui a dit que j'etais sortie, j'ai fini par aller moi-meme lui parler pour qu'elle s'en aille. J'aurais voulu que tu voies comme je l'ai recue, ma femme de chambre qui m'entendait de la piece voisine m'a dit que je criais a tue-tete: Mais puisque je vous dis que je ne veux pas! C'est une idee comme ca, ca ne me plait pas. Je pense que je suis libre de faire ce que je veux tout de meme! Si j'avais besoin d'argent, je comprends... Le concierge a ordre de ne plus la laisser entrer, il dira que je suis a la campagne. Ah! j'aurais voulu que tu sois cache quelque part. Je crois que tu aurais ete content, mon cheri. Elle a du bon, tout de meme, tu vois, ta petite Odette, quoiqu'on la trouve si detestable. D'ailleurs ses aveux meme, quand elle lui en faisait, de fautes qu'elle le supposait avoir decouvertes, servaient plutot pour Swann de point de depart a de nouveaux doutes qu'ils ne mettaient un terme aux anciens. Car ils n'etaient jamais exactement proportionnes a ceux-ci. Odette avait eu beau retrancher de sa confession tout l'essentiel, il restait dans l'accessoire quelque chose que Swann n'avait jamais imagine, qui l'accablait de sa nouveaute et allait lui permettre de changer les termes du probleme de sa jalousie. Et ces aveux il ne pouvait plus les oublier. Son ame les charriait, les rejetait, les bercait, comme des cadavres. Et elle en etait empoisonnee. Une fois elle lui parla d'une visite que Forcheville lui avait faite le jour de la Fete de Paris-Murcie. Comment, tu le connaissais deja? Ah! oui, c'est vrai, dit-il en se reprenant pour ne pas paraitre l'avoir ignore. Et tout d'un coup il se mit a trembler a la pensee que le jour de cette fete de Paris-Murcie ou il avait recu d'elle la lettre qu'il avait si precieusement gardee, elle dejeunait peut-etre avec Forcheville a la Maison d'Or. Elle lui jura que non. Pourtant la Maison d'Or me rappelle je ne sais quoi que j'ai su ne pas etre vrai, lui dit-il pour l'effrayer. --Oui, que je n'y etais pas allee le soir ou je t'ai dit que j'en sortais quand tu m'avais cherchee chez Prevost, lui repondit-elle (croyant a son air qu'il le savait), avec une decision ou il y avait, beaucoup plus que du cynisme, de la timidite, une peur de contrarier Swann et que par amour-propre elle voulait cacher, puis le desir de lui montrer qu'elle pouvait etre franche. Aussi frappa-t-elle avec une nettete et une vigueur de bourreau et qui etaient exemptes de cruaute car Odette n'avait pas conscience du mal qu'elle faisait a Swann; et meme elle se mit a rire, peut-etre il est vrai, surtout pour ne pas avoir l'air humilie, confus. C'est vrai que je n'avais pas ete a la Maison Doree, que je sortais de chez Forcheville. J'avais vraiment ete chez Prevost, ca c'etait pas de la blague, il m'y avait rencontree et m'avait demande d'entrer regarder ses gravures. Mais il etait venu quelqu'un pour le voir. Je t'ai dit que je venais de la Maison d'Or parce que j'avais peur que cela ne t'ennuie. Tu vois, c'etait plutot gentil de ma part. Mettons que j'aie eu tort, au moins je te le dis carrement. Quel interet aurais-je a ne pas te dire aussi bien que j'avais dejeune avec lui le jour de la Fete Paris-Murcie, si c'etait vrai? D'autant plus qu'a ce moment-la on ne se connaissait pas encore beaucoup tous les deux, dis, cheri. Il lui sourit avec la lachete soudaine de l'etre sans forces qu'avaient fait de lui ces accablantes paroles. Ainsi, meme dans les mois auxquels il n'avait jamais plus ose repenser parce qu'ils avaient ete trop heureux, dans ces mois ou elle l'avait aime, elle lui mentait deja! Aussi bien que ce moment (le premier soir qu'ils avaient fait catleya) ou elle lui avait dit sortir de la Maison Doree, combien devait-il y en avoir eu d'autres, receleurs eux aussi d'un mensonge que Swann n'avait pas soupconne. Il se rappela qu'elle lui avait dit un jour: Je n'aurais qu'a dire a Mme Verdurin que ma robe n'a pas ete prete, que mon cab est venu en retard. Il y a toujours moyen de s'arranger. A lui aussi probablement, bien des fois ou elle lui avait glisse de ces mots qui expliquent un retard, justifient un changement d'heure dans un rendezvous, ils avaient du cacher sans qu'il s'en fut doute alors, quelque chose qu'elle avait a faire avec un autre a qui elle avait dit: Je n'aurai qu'a dire a Swann que ma robe n'a pas ete prete, que mon cab est arrive en",3.7581204411627405,1.6154689315857758,0.3096475299188675,0.09004158810931985,4.400130548302872,4.0,2.5440916004990832,21.27777777777778,15.5,18.874749609981748,1.2976501305483028,1.0,0.6311494034674928,1532,570,0.3720626631853786,8050,72,25.666025631385484,140156519485.1145,72960187.13436465,0.6792993081313833,0.6996297116790499,75.45685451116917,8.020604873803308,9.480561806807417,10.834870902233828,9.933503771395419,8.681644908616189,41.96968378299971,4.402777777777778,True,62.0,0.8797501301405518,4.190525767829255,1921.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.013182286302780639,0.009474768280123584,0.009474768280123584,0.009474768280123584,0.009474768280123584,0.009474768280123584,0.006179196704428424,0.002780638516992791,0.0,0.13846954711087975,86,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"puissent ainsi dechirer le cur comme s'ils le touchaient veritablement, puissent rendre malade, comme un poison qu'on absorberait. Involontairement Swann pensa a ce mot qu'il avait entendu chez Mme de Saint-Euverte: C'est ce que j'ai vu de plus fort depuis les tables tournantes. Cette souffrance qu'il ressentait ne ressemblait a rien de ce qu'il avait cru. Non pas seulement parce que dans ses heures de plus entiere mefiance il avait rarement imagine si loin dans le mal, mais parce que meme quand il imaginait cette chose, elle restait vague, incertaine, denuee de cette horreur particuliere qui s'etait echappee des mots peut-etre deux ou trois fois, depourvue de cette cruaute specifique aussi differente de tout ce qu'il avait connu qu'une maladie dont on est atteint pour la premiere fois. Et pourtant cette Odette d'ou lui venait tout ce mal, ne lui etait pas moins chere, bien au contraire plus precieuse, comme si au fur et a mesure que grandissait la souffrance, grandissait en meme temps le prix du calmant, du contrepoison que seule cette femme possedait. Il voulait lui donner plus de soins comme a une maladie qu'on decouvre soudain plus grave. Il voulait que la chose affreuse qu'elle lui avait dit avoir faite deux ou trois fois ne put pas se renouveler. Pour cela il lui fallait veiller sur Odette. On dit souvent qu'en denoncant a un ami les fautes de sa maitresse, on ne reussit qu'a le rapprocher d'elle parce qu'il ne leur ajoute pas foi, mais combien davantage s'il leur ajoute foi. Mais, se disait Swann, comment reussir a la proteger? Il pouvait peut-etre la preserver d'une certaine femme mais il y en avait des centaines d'autres et il comprit quelle folie avait passe sur lui quand il avait le soir ou il n'avait pas trouve Odette chez les Verdurin, commence de desirer la possession, toujours impossible, d'un autre etre. Heureusement pour Swann, sous les souffrances nouvelles qui venaient d'entrer dans son ame comme des hordes d'envahisseurs, il existait un fond de nature plus ancien, plus doux et silencieusement laborieux, comme les cellules d'un organe blesse qui se mettent aussitot en mesure de refaire les tissus leses, comme les muscles d'un membre paralyse qui tendent a reprendre leurs mouvements. Ces plus anciens, plus autochtones habitants de son ame, employerent un instant toutes les forces de Swann a ce travail obscurement reparateur qui donne l'illusion du repos a un convalescent, a un opere. Cette fois-ci ce fut moins comme d'habitude dans le cerveau de Swann que se produisit cette detente par epuisement, ce fut plutot dans son cur. Mais toutes les choses de la vie qui ont existe une fois tendent a se recreer, et comme un animal expirant qu'agite de nouveau le sursaut d'une convulsion qui semblait finie, sur le cur, un instant epargne, de Swann, d'elle-meme la meme souffrance vint retracer la meme croix. Il se rappela ces soirs de clair de lune, ou allonge dans sa victoria qui le menait rue La Perouse, il cultivait voluptueusement en lui les emotions de l'homme amoureux, sans savoir le fruit empoisonne qu'elles produiraient necessairement. Mais toutes ces pensees ne durerent que l'espace d'une seconde, le temps qu'il portat la main a son cur, reprit sa respiration et parvint a sourire pour dissimuler sa torture. Deja il recommencait a poser ses questions. Car sa jalousie qui avait pris une peine qu'un ennemi ne se serait pas donnee pour arriver a lui faire assener ce coup, a lui faire faire la connaissance de la douleur la plus cruelle qu'il eut encore jamais connue, sa jalousie ne trouvait pas qu'il eut assez souffert et cherchait a lui faire recevoir une blessure plus profonde encore. Telle comme une divinite mechante, sa jalousie inspirait Swann et le poussait a sa perte. Ce ne fut pas sa faute, mais celle d'Odette seulement si d'abord son supplice ne s'aggrava pas. --Ma cherie, lui dit-il, c'est fini, etait-ce avec une personne que je connais? --Mais non je te jure, d'ailleurs je crois que j'ai exagere, que je n'ai pas ete jusque-la. Il sourit et reprit: --Que veux-tu? cela ne fait rien, mais c'est malheureux que tu ne puisses pas me dire le nom. De pouvoir me representer la personne, cela m'empecherait de plus jamais y penser. Je le dis pour toi parce que je ne t'ennuierais plus. C'est si calmant de se representer les choses. Ce qui est affreux c'est ce qu'on ne peut pas imaginer. Mais tu as deja ete si gentille, je ne veux pas te fatiguer. Je te remercie de tout mon cur de tout le bien que tu m'as fait. C'est fini. Seulement ce mot: Il y a combien de temps? --Oh! Charles, mais tu ne vois pas que tu me tues, c'est tout ce qu'il y a de plus ancien. Je n'y avais jamais repense, on dirait que tu veux absolument me redonner ces idees-la. Tu seras bien avance, dit-elle, avec une sottise inconsciente et une mechancete voulue. --Oh! je voulais seulement savoir si c'est depuis que je te connais. Mais ce serait si naturel, est-ce que ca se passait ici; tu ne peux pas me dire un certain soir, que je me represente ce que je faisais ce soir-la; tu comprends bien qu'il n'est pas possible que tu ne te rappelles pas avec qui, Odette, mon amour. --Mais je ne sais pas, moi, je crois que c'etait au Bois un soir ou tu es venu nous retrouver dans l'ile. Tu avais dine chez la princesse des Laumes, dit-elle, heureuse de fournir un detail precis qui attestait sa veracite. A une table voisine il y avait une femme que je n'avais pas vue depuis tres longtemps. Elle m'a dit: Venez donc derriere le petit rocher voir l'effet du clair de lune sur l'eau. D'abord j'ai baille et j'ai repondu: Non, je suis fatiguee et je suis bien ici. Elle a assure qu'il n'y avait jamais eu un clair de lune pareil. Je lui ai dit cette blague! je savais bien ou elle voulait en venir. Odette racontait cela presque en riant, soit que cela lui parut tout naturel, ou parce qu'elle croyait en attenuer ainsi l'importance, ou pour ne pas avoir l'air humilie. En voyant le visage de Swann, elle changea de ton: --Tu es un miserable, tu te plais a me torturer, a me faire faire des mensonges que je dis afin que tu me laisses tranquille. Ce second coup porte a Swann etait plus atroce encore que le premier. Jamais il n'avait suppose que ce fut une chose aussi recente, cachee a ses yeux qui n'avaient pas su la decouvrir, non dans un passe qu'il n'avait pas connu, mais dans des soirs qu'il se rappelait si bien, qu'il avait vecus avec Odette, qu'il avait cru connus si bien par lui et qui maintenant prenaient retrospectivement quelque chose de fourbe et d'atroce; au milieu d'eux tout d'un coup se creusait cette ouverture beante, ce moment dans l'Ile du Bois. Odette sans etre intelligente avait le charme du naturel. Elle avait raconte, elle avait mime cette scene avec tant de simplicite que Swann haletant voyait tout; le baillement d'Odette, le petit rocher. Il l'entendait repondre--gaiement, helas! : Cette blague!!! Il sentait qu'elle ne dirait rien de plus ce soir, qu'il n'y avait aucune revelation nouvelle a attendre en ce moment; il se taisait; il lui dit: --Mon pauvre cheri, pardonne-moi, je sens que je te fais de la peine, c'est fini, je n'y pense plus. Mais elle vit que ses yeux restaient fixes sur les choses qu'il ne savait pas et sur ce passe de leur amour, monotone et doux dans sa memoire parce qu'il etait vague, et que dechirait maintenant comme une blessure cette minute dans l'ile du Bois, au clair de lune, apres le diner chez la princesse des Laumes. Mais il avait tellement pris l'habitude de trouver la vie interessante--d'admirer les curieuses decouvertes qu'on peut y faire--que tout en souffrant au point de croire qu'il ne pourrait pas supporter longtemps une pareille douleur, il se disait: La vie est vraiment etonnante et reserve de belles surprises; en somme le vice est quelque chose de plus repandu qu'on ne croit. Voila une femme en qui j'avais confiance, qui a l'air si simple, si honnete, en tous cas, si meme elle etait legere, qui semblait bien normale et saine dans ses gouts: sur une denonciation invraisemblable, je l'interroge et le peu qu'elle m'avoue revele bien plus que ce qu'on eut pu soupconner. Mais il ne pouvait pas se borner a ces remarques desinteressees. Il cherchait a apprecier exactement la valeur de ce qu'elle lui avait raconte, afin de savoir s'il devait conclure que ces choses, elle les avait faites souvent, qu'elles se renouvelleraient. Il se repetait ces mots qu'elle avait dits: Je voyais bien ou elle voulait en venir, Deux ou trois fois, Cette blague! mais ils ne reparaissaient pas desarmes dans la memoire de Swann, chacun d'eux tenait son couteau et lui en portait un nouveau coup. Pendant bien longtemps, comme un malade ne peut s'empecher d'essayer a toute minute de faire le mouvement qui lui est douloureux, il se redisait ces mots: Je suis bien ici, Cette blague!, mais la souffrance etait si forte qu'il etait oblige de s'arreter. Il s'emerveillait que des actes que toujours il avait juges si legerement, si gaiement, maintenant fussent devenus pour lui graves comme une maladie dont on peut mourir. Il connaissait bien des femmes a qui il eut pu demander de surveiller Odette. Mais comment esperer qu'elles se placeraient au meme point de vue que lui et ne resteraient pas a celui qui avait ete si longtemps le sien, qui avait toujours guide sa vie voluptueuse, ne lui diraient pas en riant: Vilain jaloux qui veut priver les autres d'un plaisir. Par quelle trappe soudainement abaissee (lui qui n'avait eu autrefois de son amour pour Odette que des plaisirs delicats) avait-il ete brusquement precipite dans ce nouveau cercle de l'enfer d'ou il n'apercevait",3.6860732530020948,1.6425168982294205,0.33063926612028316,0.0940855555600732,4.471456061577935,4.0,2.570179782554239,21.06756756756757,14.5,16.64520958688657,1.2790250160359204,1.0,0.6139411573789307,1559,587,0.3765234124438743,7956,74,24.276023721814045,34909461124.69569,18354080.507200677,0.685132013334038,0.6913901983967258,77.24590256228007,7.718846540575214,9.323349610989473,10.659227155314392,10.164341833815854,9.087158434894164,41.401114713173726,4.283783783783784,True,52.0,0.8838065194532071,4.182965299684542,1902.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.014143094841930116,0.006031613976705491,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0037437603993344427,0.005407653910149751,0.0,0.11724500525762356,85,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"supposait que son nom n'etait jamais profere devant les Verdurin. --D'ailleurs, ajouta Mme Cottard, Mme de Crecy etait la et c'est tout dire. Quand Odette est quelque part elle ne peut jamais rester bien longtemps sans parler de vous. Et vous pensez que ce n'est pas en mal. Comment! vous en doutez, dit-elle, en voyant un geste sceptique de Swann? Et emportee par la sincerite de sa conviction, ne mettant d'ailleurs aucune mauvaise pensee sous ce mot qu'elle prenait seulement dans le sens ou on l'emploie pour parler de l'affection qui unit des amis: --Mais elle vous adore! Ah! je crois qu'il ne faudrait pas dire ca de vous devant elle! On serait bien arrange! A propos de tout, si on voyait un tableau par exemple elle disait: Ah! s'il etait la, c'est lui qui saurait vous dire si c'est authentique ou non. Il n'y a personne comme lui pour ca. Et a tout moment elle demandait: Qu'est-ce qu'il peut faire en ce moment? Si seulement il travaillait un peu! C'est malheureux, un garcon si doue, qu'il soit si paresseux. (Vous me pardonnez, n'est-ce pas?) En ce moment je le vois, il pense a nous, il se demande ou nous sommes. Elle a meme eu un mot que j'ai trouve bien joli; M. Verdurin lui disait: Mais comment pouvez-vous voir ce qu'il fait en ce moment puisque vous etes a huit cents lieues de lui? Alors Odette lui a repondu: Rien n'est impossible a l'il d'une amie. Non je vous jure, je ne vous dis pas cela pour vous flatter, vous avez la une vraie amie comme on n'en a pas beaucoup. Je vous dirai du reste que si vous ne le savez pas, vous etes le seul. Mme Verdurin me le disait encore le dernier jour (vous savez les veilles de depart on cause mieux): Je ne dis pas qu'Odette ne nous aime pas, mais tout ce que nous lui disons ne peserait pas lourd aupres de ce que lui dirait M. Swann. Oh! mon Dieu, voila que le conducteur m'arrete, en bavardant avec vous j'allais laisser passer la rue Bonaparte... me rendriez-vous le service de me dire si mon aigrette est droite? Et Mme Cottard sortit de son manchon pour la tendre a Swann sa main gantee de blanc d'ou s'echappa, avec une correspondance, une vision de haute vie qui remplit l'omnibus, melee a l'odeur du teinturier. Et Swann se sentit deborder de tendresse pour elle, autant que pour Mme Verdurin (et presque autant que pour Odette, car le sentiment qu'il eprouvait pour cette derniere n'etant plus mele de douleur, n'etait plus guere de l'amour), tandis que de la plate-forme il la suivait de ses yeux attendris, qui enfilait courageusement la rue Bonaparte, l'aigrette haute, d'une main relevant sa jupe, de l'autre tenant son en-tout-cas et son porte-cartes dont elle laissait voir le chiffre, laissant baller devant elle son manchon. Pour faire concurrence aux sentiments maladifs que Swann avait pour Odette, Mme Cottard, meilleur therapeute que n'eut ete son mari, avait greffe a cote d'eux d'autres sentiments, normaux ceux-la, de gratitude, d'amitie, des sentiments qui dans l'esprit de Swann rendraient Odette plus humaine (plus semblable aux autres femmes, parce que d'autres femmes aussi pouvaient les lui inspirer), hateraient sa transformation definitive en cette Odette aimee d'affection paisible, qui l'avait ramene un soir apres une fete chez le peintre boire un verre d'orangeade avec Forcheville et pres de qui Swann avait entrevu qu'il pourrait vivre heureux. Jadis ayant souvent pense avec terreur qu'un jour il cesserait d'etre epris d'Odette, il s'etait promis d'etre vigilant, et des qu'il sentirait que son amour commencerait a le quitter, de s'accrocher a lui, de le retenir. Mais voici qu'a l'affaiblissement de son amour correspondait simultanement un affaiblissement du desir de rester amoureux. Car on ne peut pas changer, c'est-a-dire devenir une autre personne, tout en continuant a obeir aux sentiments de celle qu'on n'est plus. Parfois le nom apercu dans un journal, d'un des hommes qu'il supposait avoir pu etre les amants d'Odette, lui redonnait de la jalousie. Mais elle etait bien legere et comme elle lui prouvait qu'il n'etait pas encore completement sorti de ce temps ou il avait tant souffert--mais aussi ou il avait connu une maniere de sentir si voluptueuse,--et que les hasards de la route lui permettraient peut-etre d'en apercevoir encore furtivement et de loin les beautes, cette jalousie lui procurait plutot une excitation agreable comme au morne Parisien qui quitte Venise pour retrouver la France, un dernier moustique prouve que l'Italie et l'ete ne sont pas encore bien loin. Mais le plus souvent le temps si particulier de sa vie d'ou il sortait, quand il faisait effort sinon pour y rester, du moins pour en avoir une vision claire pendant qu'il le pouvait encore, il s'apercevait qu'il ne le pouvait deja plus; il aurait voulu apercevoir comme un paysage qui allait disparaitre cet amour qu'il venait de quitter; mais il est si difficile d'etre double et de se donner le spectacle veridique d'un sentiment qu'on a cesse de posseder, que bientot l'obscurite se faisant dans son cerveau, il ne voyait plus rien, renoncait a regarder, retirait son lorgnon, en essuyait les verres; et il se disait qu'il valait mieux se reposer un peu, qu'il serait encore temps tout a l'heure, et se rencognait, avec l'incuriosite, dans l'engourdissement, du voyageur ensommeille qui rabat son chapeau sur ses yeux pour dormir dans le wagon qu'il sent l'entrainer de plus en plus vite, loin du pays, ou il a si longtemps vecu et qu'il s'etait promis de ne pas laisser fuir sans lui donner un dernier adieu. Meme, comme ce voyageur s'il se reveille seulement en France, quand Swann ramassa par hasard pres de lui la preuve que Forcheville avait ete l'amant d'Odette, il s'apercut qu'il n'en ressentait aucune douleur, que l'amour etait loin maintenant et regretta de n'avoir pas ete averti du moment ou il le quittait pour toujours. Et de meme qu'avant d'embrasser Odette pour la premiere fois il avait cherche a imprimer dans sa memoire le visage qu'elle avait eu si longtemps pour lui et qu'allait transformer le souvenir de ce baiser, de meme il eut voulu, en pensee au moins, avoir pu faire ses adieux, pendant qu'elle existait encore, a cette Odette lui inspirant de l'amour, de la jalousie, a cette Odette lui causant des souffrances et que maintenant il ne reverrait jamais. Il se trompait. Il devait la revoir une fois encore, quelques semaines plus tard. Ce fut en dormant, dans le crepuscule d'un reve. Il se promenait avec Mme Verdurin, le docteur Cottard, un jeune homme en fez qu'il ne pouvait identifier, le peintre, Odette, Napoleon III et mon grand-pere, sur un chemin qui suivait la mer et la surplombait a pic tantot de tres haut, tantot de quelques metres seulement, de sorte qu'on montait et redescendait constamment; ceux des promeneurs qui redescendaient deja n'etaient plus visibles a ceux qui montaient encore, le peu de jour qui restat faiblissait et il semblait alors qu'une nuit noire allait s'etendre immediatement. Par moment les vagues sautaient jusqu'au bord et Swann sentait sur sa joue des eclaboussures glacees. Odette lui disait de les essuyer, il ne pouvait pas et en etait confus vis-a-vis d'elle, ainsi que d'etre en chemise de nuit. Il esperait qu'a cause de l'obscurite on ne s'en rendait pas compte, mais cependant Mme Verdurin le fixa d'un regard etonne durant un long moment pendant lequel il vit sa figure se deformer, son nez s'allonger et qu'elle avait de grandes moustaches. Il se detourna pour regarder Odette, ses joues etaient pales, avec des petits points rouges, ses traits tires, cernes, mais elle le regardait avec des yeux pleins de tendresse prets a se detacher comme des larmes pour tomber sur lui et il se sentait l'aimer tellement qu'il aurait voulu l'emmener tout de suite. Tout d'un coup Odette tourna son poignet, regarda une petite montre et dit: Il faut que je m'en aille, elle prenait conge de tout le monde, de la meme facon, sans prendre a part a Swann, sans lui dire ou elle le reverrait le soir ou un autre jour. Il n'osa pas le lui demander, il aurait voulu la suivre et etait oblige, sans se retourner vers elle, de repondre en souriant a une question de Mme Verdurin, mais son cur battait horriblement, il eprouvait de la haine pour Odette, il aurait voulu crever ses yeux qu'il aimait tant tout a l'heure, ecraser ses joues sans fraicheur. Il continuait a monter avec Mme Verdurin, c'est-a-dire a s'eloigner a chaque pas d'Odette, qui descendait en sens inverse. Au bout d'une seconde il y eut beaucoup d'heures qu'elle etait partie. Le peintre fit remarquer a Swann que Napoleon III s'etait eclipse un instant apres elle. C'etait certainement entendu entre eux, ajouta-t-il, ils ont du se rejoindre en bas de la cote mais n'ont pas voulu dire adieu ensemble a cause des convenances. Elle est sa maitresse. Le jeune homme inconnu se mit a pleurer. Swann essaya de le consoler. Apres tout elle a raison, lui dit-il en lui essuyant les yeux et en lui otant son fez pour qu'il fut plus a son aise. Je le lui ai conseille dix fois. Pourquoi en etre triste? C'etait bien l'homme qui pouvait la comprendre. Ainsi Swann se parlait-il a lui-meme, car le jeune homme qu'il n'avait pu identifier d'abord etait aussi lui; comme certains romanciers, il avait distribue sa personnalite a deux personnages, celui qui faisait le reve, et un qu'il voyait devant lui coiffe d'un fez. Quant a Napoleon III, c'est a Forcheville que quelque vague association d'idees, puis une certaine modification dans la physionomie habituelle du baron, enfin le grand cordon de la Legion d'honneur en sautoir, lui avaient fait donner ce nom; mais en realite, et pour tout ce que le personnage present dans le reve lui representait et lui rappelait, c'etait bien Forcheville. Car, d'images incompletes et changeantes Swann endormi tirait des deductions",3.667166111689593,1.826607932568196,0.36152737166137916,0.10180554436627781,4.4983776768332255,4.0,2.548077101230859,25.262295081967213,14.0,27.525190631905947,1.2978585334198571,1.0,0.6323954711266898,1541,591,0.3835171966255678,8135,61,25.08071355688496,78057654971.22995,40761177.53066838,0.7077781534288079,0.6911808651066937,71.39493856448338,9.57702577632153,10.370008443142146,12.648720758289805,12.388506398868103,9.478754055807919,45.44399527664599,5.098360655737705,True,60.0,0.8804177545691906,4.248041775456919,1915.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006942317508933129,0.0028586013272077593,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004492087799897907,0.003675344563552833,0.0,0.13159268929503917,88,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"fausses, ayant d'ailleurs momentanement un tel pouvoir createur qu'il se reproduisait par simple division comme certains organismes inferieurs; avec la chaleur sentie de sa propre paume il modelait le creux d'une main etrangere qu'il croyait serrer et, de sentiments et d'impressions dont il n'avait pas conscience encore faisait naitre comme des peripeties qui, par leur enchainement logique ameneraient a point nomme dans le sommeil de Swann le personnage necessaire pour recevoir son amour ou provoquer son reveil. Une nuit noire se fit tout d'un coup, un tocsin sonna, des habitants passerent en courant, se sauvant des maisons en flammes; Swann entendait le bruit des vagues qui sautaient et son cur qui, avec la meme violence, battait d'anxiete dans sa poitrine. Tout d'un coup ses palpitations de cur redoublerent de vitesse, il eprouva une souffrance, une nausee inexplicables; un paysan couvert de brulures lui jetait en passant: Venez demander a Charlus ou Odette est allee finir la soiree avec son camarade, il a ete avec elle autrefois et elle lui dit tout. C'est eux qui ont mis le feu. C'etait son valet de chambre qui venait l'eveiller et lui disait: --Monsieur, il est huit heures et le coiffeur est la, je lui ai dit de repasser dans une heure. Mais ces paroles en penetrant dans les ondes du sommeil ou Swann etait plonge, n'etaient arrivees jusqu'a sa conscience qu'en subissant cette deviation qui fait qu'au fond de l'eau un rayon parait un soleil, de meme qu'un moment auparavant le bruit de la sonnette prenant au fond de ces abimes une sonorite de tocsin avait enfante l'episode de l'incendie. Cependant le decor qu'il avait sous les yeux vola en poussiere, il ouvrit les yeux, entendit une derniere fois le bruit d'une des vagues de la mer qui s'eloignait. Il toucha sa joue. Elle etait seche. Et pourtant il se rappelait la sensation de l'eau froide et le gout du sel. Il se leva, s'habilla. Il avait fait venir le coiffeur de bonne heure parce qu'il avait ecrit la veille a mon grand-pere qu'il irait dans l'apres-midi a Combray, ayant appris que Mme de Cambremer--Mlle Legrandin--devait y passer quelques jours. Associant dans son souvenir au charme de ce jeune visage celui d'une campagne ou il n'etait pas alle depuis si longtemps, ils lui offraient ensemble un attrait qui l'avait decide a quitter enfin Paris pour quelques jours. Comme les differents hasards qui nous mettent en presence de certaines personnes ne coincident pas avec le temps ou nous les aimons, mais, le depassant, peuvent se produire avant qu'il commence et se repeter apres qu'il a fini, les premieres apparitions que fait dans notre vie un etre destine plus tard a nous plaire, prennent retrospectivement a nos yeux une valeur d'avertissement, de presage. C'est de cette facon que Swann s'etait souvent reporte a l'image d'Odette rencontree au theatre, ce premier soir ou il ne songeait pas a la revoir jamais,--et qu'il se rappelait maintenant la soiree de Mme de Saint-Euverte ou il avait presente le general de Froberville a Mme de Cambremer. Les interets de notre vie sont si multiples qu'il n'est pas rare que dans une meme circonstance les jalons d'un bonheur qui n'existe pas encore soient poses a cote de l'aggravation d'un chagrin dont nous souffrons. Et sans doute cela aurait pu arriver a Swann ailleurs que chez Mme de Saint-Euverte. Qui sait meme, dans le cas ou, ce soir-la, il se fut trouve ailleurs, si d'autres bonheurs, d'autres chagrins ne lui seraient pas arrives, et qui ensuite lui eussent paru avoir ete inevitables? Mais ce qui lui semblait l'avoir ete, c'etait ce qui avait eu lieu, et il n'etait pas loin de voir quelque chose de providentiel dans ce qu'il se fut decide a aller a la soiree de Mme de Saint-Euverte, parce que son esprit desireux d'admirer la richesse d'invention de la vie et incapable de se poser longtemps une question difficile, comme de savoir ce qui eut ete le plus a souhaiter, considerait dans les souffrances qu'il avait eprouvees ce soir-la et les plaisirs encore insoupconnes qui germaient deja,--et entre lesquels la balance etait trop difficile a etablir--, une sorte d'enchainement necessaire. Mais tandis que, une heure apres son reveil, il donnait des indications au coiffeur pour que sa brosse ne se derangeat pas en wagon, il repensa a son reve, il revit comme il les avait sentis tout pres de lui, le teint pale d'Odette, les joues trop maigres, les traits tires, les yeux battus, tout ce que--au cours des tendresses successives qui avaient fait de son durable amour pour Odette un long oubli de l'image premiere qu'il avait recue d'elle--il avait cesse de remarquer depuis les premiers temps de leur liaison dans lesquels sans doute, pendant qu'il dormait, sa memoire en avait ete chercher la sensation exacte. Et avec cette muflerie intermittente qui reparaissait chez lui des qu'il n'etait plus malheureux et que baissait du meme coup le niveau de sa moralite, il s'ecria en lui-meme: Dire que j'ai gache des annees de ma vie, que j'ai voulu mourir, que j'ai eu mon plus grand amour, pour une femme qui ne me plaisait pas, qui n'etait pas mon genre! Parmi les chambres dont j'evoquais le plus souvent l'image dans mes nuits d'insomnie, aucune ne ressemblait moins aux chambres de Combray, saupoudrees d'une atmosphere grenue, pollinisee, comestible et devote, que celle du Grand-Hotel de la Plage, a Balbec, dont les murs passes au ripolin contenaient comme les parois polies d'une piscine ou l'eau bleuit, un air pur, azure et salin. Le tapissier bavarois qui avait ete charge de l'amenagement de cet hotel avait varie la decoration des pieces et sur trois cotes, fait courir le long des murs, dans celle que je me trouvai habiter, des bibliotheques basses, a vitrines en glace, dans lesquelles selon la place qu'elles occupaient, et par un effet qu'il n'avait pas prevu, telle ou telle partie du tableau changeant de la mer se refletait, deroulant une frise de claires marines, qu'interrompaient seuls les pleins de l'acajou. Si bien que toute la piece avait l'air d'un de ces dortoirs modeles qu'on presente dans les expositions modern style du mobilier ou ils sont ornes d'uvres d'art qu'on a supposees capables de rejouir les yeux de celui qui couchera la et auxquelles on a donne des sujets en rapport avec le genre de site ou l'habitation doit se trouver. Mais rien ne ressemblait moins non plus a ce Balbec reel que celui dont j'avais souvent reve, les jours de tempete, quand le vent etait si fort que Francoise en me menant aux Champs-Elysees me recommandait de ne pas marcher trop pres des murs pour ne pas recevoir de tuiles sur la tete et parlait en gemissant des grands sinistres et naufrages annonces par les journaux. Je n'avais pas de plus grand desir que de voir une tempete sur la mer, moins comme un beau spectacle que comme un moment devoile de la vie reelle de la nature; ou plutot il n'y avait pour moi de beaux spectacles que ceux que je savais qui n'etaient pas artificiellement combines pour mon plaisir, mais etaient necessaires, inchangeables,--les beautes des paysages ou du grand art. Je n'etais curieux, je n'etais avide de connaitre que ce que je croyais plus vrai que moi-meme, ce qui avait pour moi le prix de me montrer un peu de la pensee d'un grand genie, ou de la force ou de la grace de la nature telle qu'elle se manifeste livree a elle-meme, sans l'intervention des hommes. De meme que le beau son de sa voix, isolement reproduit par le phonographe, ne nous consolerait pas d'avoir perdu notre mere, de meme une tempete mecaniquement imitee m'aurait laisse aussi indifferent que les fontaines lumineuses de l'Exposition. Je voulais aussi pour que la tempete fut absolument vraie, que le rivage lui-meme fut un rivage naturel, non une digue recemment creee par une municipalite. D'ailleurs la nature par tous les sentiments qu'elle eveillait en moi, me semblait ce qu'il y avait de plus oppose aux productions mecaniques des hommes. Moins elle portait leur empreinte et plus elle offrait d'espace a l'expansion de mon cur. Or j'avais retenu le nom de Balbec que nous avait cite Legrandin, comme d'une plage toute proche de ces cotes funebres, fameuses par tant de naufrages qu'enveloppent six mois de l'annee le linceul des brumes et l'ecume des vagues. On y sent encore sous ses pas, disait-il, bien plus qu'au Finistere lui-meme (et quand bien meme des hotels s'y superposeraient maintenant sans pouvoir y modifier la plus antique ossature de la terre), on y sent la veritable fin de la terre francaise, europeenne, de la Terre antique. Et c'est le dernier campement de pecheurs, pareils a tous les pecheurs qui ont vecu depuis le commencement du monde, en face du royaume eternel des brouillards de la mer et des ombres. Un jour qu'a Combray j'avais parle de cette plage de Balbec devant M. Swann afin d'apprendre de lui si c'etait le point le mieux choisi pour voir les plus fortes tempetes, il m'avait repondu: Je crois bien que je connais Balbec! L'eglise de Balbec, du XIIe et XIIIe siecle, encore a moitie romane, est peut-etre le plus curieux echantillon du gothique normand, et si singuliere, on dirait de l'art persan. Et ces lieux qui jusque-la ne m'avaient semble que de la nature immemoriale, restee contemporaine des grands phenomenes geologiques,--et tout aussi en dehors de l'histoire humaine que l'Ocean ou la grande Ourse, avec ces sauvages pecheurs pour qui, pas plus que pour les baleines, il n'y eut de moyen age--, c'avait ete un grand charme pour moi de les voir tout d'un coup entres dans la serie des siecles, ayant connu l'epoque romane, et de savoir que le trefle gothique etait venu nervurer aussi ces rochers sauvages a l'heure voulue, comme ces plantes freles mais vivaces qui, quand c'est le printemps, etoilent ca et la la neige des poles. Et si le gothique apportait a ces",4.52371411837229,1.7264197096258893,0.31171652217050333,0.0755757060266897,4.535256410256411,4.0,2.6108821695902997,38.048780487804876,32.0,24.230550379294353,1.2846153846153847,1.0,0.6353026581524913,1560,656,0.4205128205128205,8154,41,20.792728612439564,1071932158.3161262,573839.4851799391,0.8239152688533068,0.8185394326081643,59.53702626641652,14.407485928705444,11.306074632854223,17.373358348968107,18.955447936210128,10.089358974358973,59.26672920575359,8.073170731707316,True,48.0,0.9031049250535332,4.365096359743041,1868.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008762991644589362,0.006725086610963929,0.006725086610963929,0.006725086610963929,0.0,0.0,0.008151620134501733,0.0027511717953943348,0.003973914815569595,0.15310492505353318,89,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"lieux et a ces hommes une determination qui leur manquait, eux aussi lui en conferaient une en retour. J'essayais de me representer comment ces pecheurs avaient vecu, le timide et insoupconne essai de rapports sociaux qu'ils avaient tente la, pendant le moyen age, ramasses sur un point des cotes d'Enfer, aux pieds des falaises de la mort; et le gothique me semblait plus vivant maintenant que, separe des villes ou je l'avais toujours imagine jusque-la, je pouvais voir comment, dans un cas particulier, sur des rochers sauvages, il avait germe et fleuri en un fin clocher. On me mena voir des reproductions des plus celebres statues de Balbec--les apotres moutonnants et camus, la Vierge du porche, et de joie ma respiration s'arretait dans ma poitrine quand je pensais que je pourrais les voir se modeler en relief sur le brouillard eternel et sale. Alors, par les soirs orageux et doux de fevrier, le vent,--soufflant dans mon cur, qu'il ne faisait pas trembler moins fort que la cheminee de ma chambre, le projet d'un voyage a Balbec--melait en moi le desir de l'architecture gothique avec celui d'une tempete sur la mer. J'aurais voulu prendre des le lendemain le beau train genereux d'une heure vingt-deux dont je ne pouvais jamais sans que mon cur palpitat lire, dans les reclames des Compagnies de chemin de fer, dans les annonces de voyages circulaires, l'heure de depart: elle me semblait inciser a un point precis de l'apres-midi une savoureuse entaille, une marque mysterieuse a partir de laquelle les heures deviees conduisaient bien encore au soir, au matin du lendemain, mais qu'on verrait, au lieu de Paris, dans l'une de ces villes par ou le train passe et entre lesquelles il nous permettait de choisir; car il s'arretait a Bayeux, a Coutances, a Vitre, a Questambert, a Pontorson, a Balbec, a Lannion, a Lamballe, a Benodet, a Pont-Aven, a Quimperle, et s'avancait magnifiquement surcharge de noms qu'il m'offrait et entre lesquels je ne savais lequel j'aurais prefere, par impossibilite d'en sacrifier aucun. Mais sans meme l'attendre, j'aurais pu en m'habillant a la hate partir le soir meme, si mes parents me l'avaient permis, et arriver a Balbec quand le petit jour se leverait sur la mer furieuse, contre les ecumes envolees de laquelle j'irais me refugier dans l'eglise de style persan. Mais a l'approche des vacances de Paques, quand mes parents m'eurent promis de me les faire passer une fois dans le nord de l'Italie, voila qu'a ces reves de tempete dont j'avais ete rempli tout entier, ne souhaitant voir que des vagues accourant de partout, toujours plus haut, sur la cote la plus sauvage, pres d'eglises escarpees et rugueuses comme des falaises et dans les tours desquelles crieraient les oiseaux de mer, voila que tout a coup les effacant, leur otant tout charme, les excluant parce qu'ils lui etaient opposes et n'auraient pu que l'affaiblir, se substituaient en moi le reve contraire du printemps le plus diapre, non pas le printemps de Combray qui piquait encore aigrement avec toutes les aiguilles du givre, mais celui qui couvrait deja de lys et d'anemones les champs de Fiesole et eblouissait Florence de fonds d'or pareils a ceux de l'Angelico. Des lors, seuls les rayons, les parfums, les couleurs me semblaient avoir du prix; car l'alternance des images avait amene en moi un changement de front du desir, et,--aussi brusque que ceux qu'il y a parfois en musique, un complet changement de ton dans ma sensibilite. Puis il arriva qu'une simple variation atmospherique suffit a provoquer en moi cette modulation sans qu'il y eut besoin d'attendre le retour d'une saison. Car souvent dans l'une, on trouve egare un jour d'une autre, qui nous y fait vivre, en evoque aussitot, en fait desirer les plaisirs particuliers et interrompt les reves que nous etions en train de faire, en placant, plus tot ou plus tard qu'a son tour, ce feuillet detache d'un autre chapitre, dans le calendrier interpole du Bonheur. Mais bientot comme ces phenomenes naturels dont notre confort ou notre sante ne peuvent tirer qu'un benefice accidentel et assez mince jusqu'au jour ou la science s'empare d'eux, et les produisant a volonte, remet en nos mains la possibilite de leur apparition, soustraite a la tutelle et dispensee de l'agrement du hasard, de meme la production de ces reves d'Atlantique et d'Italie cessa d'etre soumise uniquement aux changements des saisons et du temps. Je n'eus besoin pour les faire renaitre que de prononcer ces noms: Balbec, Venise, Florence, dans l'interieur desquels avait fini par s'accumuler le desir que m'avaient inspire les lieux qu'ils designaient. Meme au printemps, trouver dans un livre le nom de Balbec suffisait a reveiller en moi le desir des tempetes et du gothique normand; meme par un jour de tempete le nom de Florence ou de Venise me donnait le desir du soleil, des lys, du palais des Doges et de Sainte-Marie-des-Fleurs. Mais si ces noms absorberent a tout jamais l'image que j'avais de ces villes, ce ne fut qu'en la transformant, qu'en soumettant sa reapparition en moi a leurs lois propres; ils eurent ainsi pour consequence de la rendre plus belle, mais aussi plus differente de ce que les villes de Normandie ou de Toscane pouvaient etre en realite, et, en accroissant les joies arbitraires de mon imagination, d'aggraver la deception future de mes voyages. Ils exalterent l'idee que je me faisais de certains lieux de la terre, en les faisant plus particuliers, par consequent plus reels. Je ne me representais pas alors les villes, les paysages, les monuments, comme des tableaux plus ou moins agreables, decoupes ca et la dans une meme matiere, mais chacun d'eux comme un inconnu, essentiellement different des autres, dont mon ame avait soif et qu'elle aurait profit a connaitre. Combien ils prirent quelque chose de plus individuel encore, d'etre designes par des noms, des noms qui n'etaient que pour eux, des noms comme en ont les personnes. Les mots nous presentent des choses une petite image claire et usuelle comme celles que l'on suspend aux murs des ecoles pour donner aux enfants l'exemple de ce qu'est un etabli, un oiseau, une fourmiliere, choses concues comme pareilles a toutes celles de meme sorte. Mais les noms presentent des personnes--et des villes qu'ils nous habituent a croire individuelles, uniques comme des personnes--une image confuse qui tire d'eux, de leur sonorite eclatante ou sombre, la couleur dont elle est peinte uniformement comme une de ces affiches, entierement bleues ou entierement rouges, dans lesquelles, a cause des limites du procede employe ou par un caprice du decorateur, sont bleus ou rouges, non seulement le ciel et la mer, mais les barques, l'eglise, les passants. Le nom de Parme, une des villes ou je desirais le plus aller, depuis que j'avais lu la Chartreuse, m'apparaissant compact, lisse, mauve et doux; si on me parlait d'une maison quelconque de Parme dans laquelle je serais recu, on me causait le plaisir de penser que j'habiterais une demeure lisse, compacte, mauve et douce, qui n'avait de rapport avec les demeures d'aucune ville d'Italie puisque je l'imaginais seulement a l'aide de cette syllabe lourde du nom de Parme, ou ne circule aucun air, et de tout ce que je lui avais fait absorber de douceur stendhalienne et du reflet des violettes. Et quand je pensais a Florence, c'etait comme a une ville miraculeusement embaumee et semblable a une corolle, parce qu'elle s'appelait la cite des lys et sa cathedrale, Sainte-Marie-des-Fleurs. Quant a Balbec, c'etait un de ces noms ou comme sur une vieille poterie normande qui garde la couleur de la terre d'ou elle fut tiree, on voit se peindre encore la representation de quelque usage aboli, de quelque droit feodal, d'un etat ancien de lieux, d'une maniere desuete de prononcer qui en avait forme les syllabes heteroclites et que je ne doutais pas de retrouver jusque chez l'aubergiste qui me servirait du cafe au lait a mon arrivee, me menant voir la mer dechainee devant l'eglise et auquel je pretais l'aspect disputeur, solennel et medieval d'un personnage de fabliau. Si ma sante s'affermissait et que mes parents me permissent, sinon d'aller sejourner a Balbec, du moins de prendre une fois, pour faire connaissance avec l'architecture et les paysages de la Normandie ou de la Bretagne, ce train d'une heure vingt-deux dans lequel j'etais monte tant de fois en imagination, j'aurais voulu m'arreter de preference dans les villes les plus belles; mais j'avais beau les comparer, comment choisir plus qu'entre des etres individuels, qui ne sont pas interchangeables, entre Bayeux si haute dans sa noble dentelle rougeatre et dont le faite etait illumine par le vieil or de sa derniere syllabe; Vitre dont l'accent aigu losangeait de bois noir le vitrage ancien; le doux Lamballe qui, dans son blanc, va du jaune coquille d'uf au gris perle; Coutances, cathedrale normande, que sa diphtongue finale, grasse et jaunissante couronne par une tour de beurre; Lannion avec le bruit, dans son silence villageois, du coche suivi de la mouche; Questambert, Pontorson, risibles et naifs, plumes blanches et becs jaunes eparpilles sur la route de ces lieux fluviatiles et poetiques; Benodet, nom a peine amarre que semble vouloir entrainer la riviere au milieu de ses algues, Pont-Aven, envolee blanche et rose de l'aile d'une coiffe legere qui se reflete en tremblant dans une eau verdie de canal; Quimperle, lui, mieux attache et, depuis le moyen age, entre les ruisseaux dont il gazouille et s'emperle en une grisaille pareille a celle que dessinent, a travers les toiles d'araignees d'une verriere, les rayons de soleil changes en pointes emoussees d'argent bruni? Ces images etaient fausses pour une autre raison encore; c'est qu'elles etaient forcement tres simplifiees; sans doute ce a quoi aspirait mon imagination et que mes sens ne percevaient qu'incompletement et sans plaisir dans le present, je l'avais enferme dans le refuge des noms; sans doute, parce que j'y avais accumule du reve, ils aimantaient maintenant mes desirs; mais les noms ne sont",4.601334857065043,1.981595959526704,0.33409183350435484,0.08848337977632192,4.646006389776358,4.0,2.6958597459673643,50.483870967741936,43.0,57.49663158029455,1.3143769968051118,1.0,0.6411483894032889,1565,672,0.4293929712460064,8392,31,25.090578629769325,78831510219.98517,41446640.49420881,0.8008502840995788,0.7792777110790384,44.39757703802951,19.60835823971968,13.3380643245848,22.723899824796458,25.694625579717616,10.932191693290733,74.6372256003298,12.193548387096774,True,74.0,0.8859095688748686,4.412197686645636,1902.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.00915240748109829,0.00477516912057302,0.00477516912057302,0.00477516912057302,0.0,0.0,0.003581376840429765,0.002686032630322324,0.0,0.15562565720294427,90,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"pas tres vastes; c'est tout au plus si je pouvais y faire entrer deux ou trois des curiosites principales de la ville et elles s'y juxtaposaient sans intermediaires; dans le nom de Balbec, comme dans le verre grossissant de ces porte-plume qu'on achete aux bains de mer, j'apercevais des vagues soulevees autour d'une eglise de style persan. Peut-etre meme la simplification de ces images fut-elle une des causes de l'empire qu'elles prirent sur moi. Quand mon pere eut decide, une annee, que nous irions passer les vacances de Paques a Florence et a Venise, n'ayant pas la place de faire entrer dans le nom de Florence les elements qui composent d'habitude les villes, je fus contraint a faire sortir une cite surnaturelle de la fecondation, par certains parfums printaniers, de ce que je croyais etre, en son essence, le genie de Giotto. Tout au plus--et parce qu'on ne peut pas faire tenir dans un nom beaucoup plus de duree que d'espace--comme certains tableaux de Giotto eux-memes qui montrent a deux moments differents de l'action un meme personnage, ici couche dans son lit, la s'appretant a monter a cheval, le nom de Florence etait-il divise en deux compartiments. Dans l'un, sous un dais architectural, je contemplais une fresque a laquelle etait partiellement superpose un rideau de soleil matinal, poudreux, oblique et progressif; dans l'autre (car ne pensant pas aux noms comme a un ideal inaccessible mais comme a une ambiance reelle dans laquelle j'irais me plonger, la vie non vecue encore, la vie intacte et pure que j'y enfermais donnait aux plaisirs les plus materiels, aux scenes les plus simples, cet attrait qu'ils ont dans les uvres des primitifs), je traversais rapidement,--pour trouver plus vite le dejeuner qui m'attendait avec des fruits et du vin de Chianti--le Ponte-Vecchio encombre de jonquilles, de narcisses et d'anemones. Voila (bien que je fusse a Paris) ce que je voyais et non ce qui etait autour de moi. Meme a un simple point de vue realiste, les pays que nous desirons tiennent a chaque moment beaucoup plus de place dans notre vie veritable, que le pays ou nous nous trouvons effectivement. Sans doute si alors j'avais fait moi-meme plus attention a ce qu'il y avait dans ma pensee quand je prononcais les mots aller a Florence, a Parme, a Pise, a Venise, je me serais rendu compte que ce que je voyais n'etait nullement une ville, mais quelque chose d'aussi different de tout ce que je connaissais, d'aussi delicieux, que pourrait etre pour une humanite dont la vie se serait toujours ecoulee dans des fins d'apres-midi d'hiver, cette merveille inconnue: une matinee de printemps. Ces images irreelles, fixes, toujours pareilles, remplissant mes nuits et mes jours, differencierent cette epoque de ma vie de celles qui l'avaient precedee (et qui auraient pu se confondre avec elle aux yeux d'un observateur qui ne voit les choses que du dehors, c'est-a-dire qui ne voit rien), comme dans un opera un motif melodique introduit une nouveaute qu'on ne pourrait pas soupconner si on ne faisait que lire le livret, moins encore si on restait en dehors du theatre a compter seulement les quarts d'heure qui s'ecoulent. Et encore, meme a ce point de vue de simple quantite, dans notre vie les jours ne sont pas egaux. Pour parcourir les jours, les natures un peu nerveuses, comme etait la mienne, disposent, comme les voitures automobiles, de vitesses differentes. Il y a des jours montueux et malaises qu'on met un temps infini a gravir et des jours en pente qui se laissent descendre a fond de train en chantant. Pendant ce mois--ou je ressassai comme une melodie, sans pouvoir m'en rassasier, ces images de Florence, de Venise et de Pise desquelles le desir qu'elles excitaient en moi gardait quelque chose d'aussi profondement individuel que si c'avait ete un amour, un amour pour une personne--je ne cessai pas de croire qu'elles correspondaient a une realite independante de moi, et elles me firent connaitre une aussi belle esperance que pouvait en nourrir un chretien des premiers ages a la veille d'entrer dans le paradis. Aussi sans que je me souciasse de la contradiction qu'il y avait a vouloir regarder et toucher avec les organes des sens, ce qui avait ete elabore par la reverie et non percu par eux--et d'autant plus tentant pour eux, plus different de ce qu'ils connaissaient--c'est ce qui me rappelait la realite de ces images, qui enflammait le plus mon desir, parce que c'etait comme une promesse qu'il serait contente. Et, bien que mon exaltation eut pour motif un desir de jouissances artistiques, les guides l'entretenaient encore plus que les livres d'esthetiques et, plus que les guides, l'indicateur des chemins de fer. Ce qui m'emouvait c'etait de penser que cette Florence que je voyais proche mais inaccessible dans mon imagination, si le trajet qui la separait de moi, en moi-meme, n'etait pas viable, je pourrais l'atteindre par un biais, par un detour, en prenant la voie de terre. Certes, quand je me repetais, donnant ainsi tant de valeur a ce que j'allais voir, que Venise etait l'ecole de Giorgione, la demeure du Titien, le plus complet musee de l'architecture domestique au moyen age, je me sentais heureux. Je l'etais pourtant davantage quand, sorti pour une course, marchant vite a cause du temps qui, apres quelques jours de printemps precoce etait redevenu un temps d'hiver (comme celui que nous trouvions d'habitude a Combray, la Semaine Sainte),--voyant sur les boulevards les marronniers qui, plonges dans un air glacial et liquide comme de l'eau, n'en commencaient pas moins, invites exacts, deja en tenue, et qui ne se sont pas laisse decourager, a arrondir et a ciseler en leurs blocs congeles, l'irresistible verdure dont la puissance abortive du froid contrariait mais ne parvenait pas a refrener la progressive poussee--, je pensais que deja le Ponte-Vecchio etait jonche a foison de jacinthes et d'anemones et que le soleil du printemps teignait deja les flots du Grand Canal d'un si sombre azur et de si nobles emeraudes qu'en venant se briser aux pieds des peintures du Titien, ils pouvaient rivaliser de riche coloris avec elles. Je ne pus plus contenir ma joie quand mon pere, tout en consultant le barometre et en deplorant le froid, commenca a chercher quels seraient les meilleurs trains, et quand je compris qu'en penetrant apres le dejeuner dans le laboratoire charbonneux, dans la chambre magique qui se chargeait d'operer la transmutation tout autour d'elle, on pouvait s'eveiller le lendemain dans la cite de marbre et d'or rehaussee de jaspe et pavee d'emeraudes. Ainsi elle et la Cite des lys n'etaient pas seulement des tableaux fictifs qu'on mettait a volonte devant son imagination, mais existaient a une certaine distance de Paris qu'il fallait absolument franchir si l'on voulait les voir, a une certaine place determinee de la terre, et a aucune autre, en un mot etaient bien reelles. Elles le devinrent encore plus pour moi, quand mon pere en disant: En somme, vous pourriez rester a Venise du 20 avril au 29 et arriver a Florence des le matin de Paques, les fit sortir toutes deux non plus seulement de l'Espace abstrait, mais de ce Temps imaginaire ou nous situons non pas un seul voyage a la fois, mais d'autres, simultanes et sans trop d'emotion puisqu'ils ne sont que possibles,--ce Temps qui se refabrique si bien qu'on peut encore le passer dans une ville apres qu'on l'a passe dans une autre--et leur consacra de ces jours particuliers qui sont le certificat d'authenticite des objets auxquels on les emploie, car ces jours uniques, ils se consument par l'usage, ils ne reviennent pas, on ne peut plus les vivre ici quand on les a vecus la; je sentis que c'etait vers la semaine qui commencait le lundi ou la blanchisseuse devait rapporter le gilet blanc que j'avais couvert d'encre, que se dirigeaient pour s'y absorber au sortir du temps ideal ou elles n'existaient pas encore, les deux Cites Reines dont j'allais avoir, par la plus emouvante des geometries, a inscrire les domes et les tours dans le plan de ma propre vie. Mais je n'etais encore qu'en chemin vers le dernier degre de l'allegresse; je l'atteignis enfin (ayant seulement alors la revelation que sur les rues clapotantes, rougies du reflet des fresques de Giorgione, ce n'etait pas, comme j'avais, malgre tant d'avertissements, continue a l'imaginer, les hommes majestueux et terribles comme la mer, portant leur armure aux reflets de bronze sous les plis de leur manteau sanglant qui se promeneraient dans Venise la semaine prochaine, la veille de Paques, mais que ce pourrait etre moi le personnage minuscule que, dans une grande photographie de Saint-Marc qu'on m'avait pretee, l'illustrateur avait represente, en chapeau melon, devant les proches), quand j'entendis mon pere me dire: Il doit faire encore froid sur le Grand Canal, tu ferais bien de mettre a tout hasard dans ta malle ton pardessus d'hiver et ton gros veston. A ces mots je m'elevai a une sorte d'extase; ce que j'avais cru jusque-la impossible, je me sentis vraiment penetrer entre ces rochers d'amethyste pareils a un recif de la mer des Indes; par une gymnastique supreme et au-dessus de mes forces, me devetant comme d'une carapace sans objet de l'air de ma chambre qui m'entourait, je le remplacai par des parties egales d'air venitien, cette atmosphere marine, indicible et particuliere comme celle des reves que mon imagination avait enfermee dans le nom de Venise, je sentis s'operer en moi une miraculeuse desincarnation; elle se doubla aussitot de la vague envie de vomir qu'on eprouve quand on vient de prendre un gros mal de gorge, et on dut me mettre au lit avec une fievre si tenace, que le docteur declara qu'il fallait renoncer non seulement a me laisser partir maintenant a Florence et a Venise mais, meme quand je serais entierement retabli, m'eviter d'ici au moins un an, tout projet de voyage et toute cause d'agitation. Et helas, il defendit aussi d'une facon",4.906228519846729,1.835800351027319,0.35628626316949774,0.0684574480192691,4.574251115360102,4.0,2.6897818763651213,56.035714285714285,54.0,34.035152146459595,1.3295092415551306,1.0,0.6795959706411316,1569,643,0.4098151688973869,8274,28,23.415676461039787,14767231291.45119,7821626.7433533855,0.9068188137478299,0.9052347495005681,37.482268164435965,21.952137621779112,14.348710955821954,25.167631794591642,28.132579896203225,10.568362014021666,77.7693025584995,12.178571428571429,True,75.0,0.892478813559322,4.382415254237288,1888.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004429232937386752,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004026575397624321,0.0036239178578618887,0.0042279041675055366,0.14883474576271186,91,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"absolue qu'on me laissat aller au theatre entendre la Berma; l'artiste sublime, a laquelle Bergotte trouvait du genie, m'aurait en me faisant connaitre quelque chose qui etait peut-etre aussi important et aussi beau, console de n'avoir pas ete a Florence et a Venise, de n'aller pas a Balbec. On devait se contenter de m'envoyer chaque jour aux Champs-Elysees, sous la surveillance d'une personne qui m'empecherait de me fatiguer et qui fut Francoise, entree a notre service apres la mort de ma tante Leonie. Aller aux Champs-Elysees me fut insupportable. Si seulement Bergotte les eut decrits dans un de ses livres, sans doute j'aurais desire de les connaitre, comme toutes les choses dont on avait commence par mettre le double dans mon imagination. Elle les rechauffait, les faisait vivre, leur donnait une personnalite, et je voulais les retrouver dans la realite; mais dans ce jardin public rien ne se rattachait a mes reves. Un jour, comme je m'ennuyais a notre place familiere, a cote des chevaux de bois, Francoise m'avait emmene en excursion--au dela de la frontiere que gardent a intervalles egaux les petits bastions des marchandes de sucre d'orge--, dans ces regions voisines mais etrangeres ou les visages sont inconnus, ou passe la voiture aux chevres; puis elle etait revenue prendre ses affaires sur sa chaise adossee a un massif de lauriers; en l'attendant je foulais la grande pelouse chetive et rase, jaunie par le soleil, au bout de laquelle le bassin est domine par une statue quand, de l'allee, s'adressant a une fillette a cheveux roux qui jouait au volant devant la vasque, une autre, en train de mettre son manteau et de serrer sa raquette, lui cria, d'une voix breve: Adieu, Gilberte, je rentre, n'oublie pas que nous venons ce soir chez toi apres diner. Ce nom de Gilberte passa pres de moi, evoquant d'autant plus l'existence de celle qu'il designait qu'il ne la nommait pas seulement comme un absent dont on parle, mais l'interpellait; il passa ainsi pres de moi, en action pour ainsi dire, avec une puissance qu'accroissait la courbe de son jet et l'approche de son but;--transportant a son bord, je le sentais, la connaissance, les notions qu'avait de celle a qui il etait adresse, non pas moi, mais l'amie qui l'appelait, tout ce que, tandis qu'elle le prononcait, elle revoyait ou du moins, possedait en sa memoire, de leur intimite quotidienne, des visites qu'elles se faisaient l'une chez l'autre, de tout cet inconnu encore plus inaccessible et plus douloureux pour moi d'etre au contraire si familier et si maniable pour cette fille heureuse qui m'en frolait sans que j'y puisse penetrer et le jetait en plein air dans un cri;--laissant deja flotter dans l'air l'emanation delicieuse qu'il avait fait se degager, en les touchant avec precision, de quelques points invisibles de la vie de Mlle Swann, du soir qui allait venir, tel qu'il serait, apres diner, chez elle,--formant, passager celeste au milieu des enfants et des bonnes, un petit nuage d'une couleur precieuse, pareil a celui qui, bombe au-dessus d'un beau jardin du Poussin, reflete minutieusement comme un nuage d'opera, plein de chevaux et de chars, quelque apparition de la vie des dieux;--jetant enfin, sur cette herbe pelee, a l'endroit ou elle etait un morceau a la fois de pelouse fletrie et un moment de l'apres-midi de la blonde joueuse de volant (qui ne s'arreta de le lancer et de le rattraper que quand une institutrice a plumet bleu l'eut appelee), une petite bande merveilleuse et couleur d'heliotrope impalpable comme un reflet et superposee comme un tapis sur lequel je ne pus me lasser de promener mes pas attardes, nostalgiques et profanateurs, tandis que Francoise me criait: Allons, aboutonnez voir votre paletot et filons et que je remarquais pour la premiere fois avec irritation qu'elle avait un langage vulgaire, et helas, pas de plumet bleu a son chapeau. Retournerait-elle seulement aux Champs-Elysees? Le lendemain elle n'y etait pas; mais je l'y vis les jours suivants; je tournais tout le temps autour de l'endroit ou elle jouait avec ses amies, si bien qu'une fois ou elles ne se trouverent pas en nombre pour leur partie de barres, elle me fit demander si je voulais completer leur camp, et je jouai desormais avec elle chaque fois qu'elle etait la. Mais ce n'etait pas tous les jours; il y en avait ou elle etait empechee de venir par ses cours, le catechisme, un gouter, toute cette vie separee de la mienne que par deux fois, condensee dans le nom de Gilberte, j'avais senti passer si douloureusement pres de moi, dans le raidillon de Combray et sur la pelouse des Champs-Elysees. Ces jours-la, elle annoncait d'avance qu'on ne la verrait pas; si c'etait a cause de ses etudes, elle disait: C'est rasant, je ne pourrai pas venir demain; vous allez tous vous amuser sans moi, d'un air chagrin qui me consolait un peu; mais en revanche quand elle etait invitee a une matinee, et que, ne le sachant pas je lui demandais si elle viendrait jouer, elle me repondait: J'espere bien que non! J'espere bien que maman me laissera aller chez mon amie. Du moins ces jours-la, je savais que je ne la verrais pas, tandis que d'autres fois, c'etait a l'improviste que sa mere l'emmenait faire des courses avec elle, et le lendemain elle disait: Ah! oui, je suis sortie avec maman, comme une chose naturelle, et qui n'eut pas ete pour quelqu'un le plus grand malheur possible. Il y avait aussi les jours de mauvais temps ou son institutrice, qui pour elle-meme craignait la pluie, ne voulait pas l'emmener aux Champs-Elysees. Aussi si le ciel etait douteux, des le matin je ne cessais de l'interroger et je tenais compte de tous les presages. Si je voyais la dame d'en face qui, pres de la fenetre, mettait son chapeau, je me disais: Cette dame va sortir; donc il fait un temps ou l'on peut sortir: pourquoi Gilberte ne ferait-elle pas comme cette dame? Mais le temps s'assombrissait, ma mere disait qu'il pouvait se lever encore, qu'il suffirait pour cela d'un rayon de soleil, mais que plus probablement il pleuvrait; et s'il pleuvait a quoi bon aller aux Champs-Elysees? Aussi depuis le dejeuner mes regards anxieux ne quittaient plus le ciel incertain et nuageux. Il restait sombre. Devant la fenetre, le balcon etait gris. Tout d'un coup, sur sa pierre maussade je ne voyais pas une couleur moins terne, mais je sentais comme un effort vers une couleur moins terne, la pulsation d'un rayon hesitant qui voudrait liberer sa lumiere. Un instant apres, le balcon etait pale et reflechissant comme une eau matinale, et mille reflets de la ferronnerie de son treillage etaient venus s'y poser. Un souffle de vent les dispersait, la pierre s'etait de nouveau assombrie, mais, comme apprivoises, ils revenaient; elle recommencait imperceptiblement a blanchir et par un de ces crescendos continus comme ceux qui, en musique, a la fin d'une Ouverture, menent une seule note jusqu'au fortissimo supreme en la faisant passer rapidement par tous les degres intermediaires, je la voyais atteindre a cet or inalterable et fixe des beaux jours, sur lequel l'ombre decoupee de l'appui ouvrage de la balustrade se detachait en noir comme une vegetation capricieuse, avec une tenuite dans la delineation des moindres details qui semblait trahir une conscience appliquee, une satisfaction d'artiste, et avec un tel relief, un tel velours dans le repos de ses masses sombres et heureuses qu'en verite ces reflets larges et feuillus qui reposaient sur ce lac de soleil semblaient savoir qu'ils etaient des gages de calme et de bonheur. Lierre instantane, flore parietaire et fugitive! la plus incolore, la plus triste, au gre de beaucoup, de celles qui peuvent ramper sur le mur ou decorer la croisee; pour moi, de toutes la plus chere depuis le jour ou elle etait apparue sur notre balcon, comme l'ombre meme de la presence de Gilberte qui etait peut-etre deja aux Champs-Elysees, et des que j'y arriverais, me dirait: Commencons tout de suite a jouer aux barres, vous etes dans mon camp; fragile, emportee par un souffle, mais aussi en rapport non pas avec la saison, mais avec l'heure; promesse du bonheur immediat que la journee refuse ou accomplira, et par la du bonheur immediat par excellence, le bonheur de l'amour; plus douce, plus chaude sur la pierre que n'est la mousse meme; vivace, a qui il suffit d'un rayon pour naitre et faire eclore de la joie, meme au cur de l'hiver. Et jusque dans ces jours ou toute autre vegetation a disparu, ou le beau cuir vert qui enveloppe le tronc des vieux arbres est cache sous la neige, quand celle-ci cessait de tomber, mais que le temps restait trop couvert pour esperer que Gilberte sortit, alors tout d'un coup, faisant dire a ma mere: Tiens voila justement qu'il fait beau, vous pourriez peut-etre essayer tout de meme d'aller aux Champs-Elysees, sur le manteau de neige qui couvrait le balcon, le soleil apparu entrelacait des fils d'or et brodait des reflets noirs. Ce jour-la nous ne trouvions personne ou une seule fillette prete a partir qui m'assurait que Gilberte ne viendrait pas. Les chaises desertees par l'assemblee imposante mais frileuse des institutrices etaient vides. Seule, pres de la pelouse, etait assise une dame d'un certain age qui venait par tous les temps, toujours hanachee d'une toilette identique, magnifique et sombre, et pour faire la connaissance de laquelle j'aurais a cette epoque sacrifie, si l'echange m'avait ete permis, tous les plus grands avantages futurs de ma vie. Car Gilberte allait tous les jours la saluer; elle demandait a Gilberte des nouvelles de son amour de mere; et il me semblait que si je l'avais connue, j'avais ete pour Gilberte quelqu'un de tout autre, quelqu'un qui connaissait les relations de ses parents.

Francoise avait trop froid pour rester immobile, nous allames jusqu'au pont de la Concorde voir la Seine prise, dont chacun et meme les enfants s'approchaient sans peur comme d'une immense baleine echouee, sans defense, et qu'on allait depecer. Nous revenions aux Champs-Elysees; je languissais de douleur entre les chevaux de bois immobiles et la pelouse blanche prise dans le reseau noir des allees dont on avait enleve la neige et sur laquelle la statue avait a la main un jet de glace ajoute qui semblait l'explication de son geste. La vieille dame elle-meme ayant plie ses Debats, demanda l'heure a une bonne d'enfants qui passait et qu'elle remercia en lui disant: Comme vous etes aimable! puis, priant le cantonnier de dire a ses petits enfants de revenir, qu'elle avait froid, ajouta: Vous serez mille fois bon. Vous savez que je suis confuse! Tout a coup l'air se dechira: entre le guignol et le cirque, a l'horizon embelli, sur le ciel entr'ouvert, je venais d'apercevoir, comme un signe fabuleux, le plumet bleu de Mademoiselle. Et deja Gilberte courait a toute vitesse dans ma direction, etincelante et rouge sous un bonnet carre de fourrure, animee par le froid, le retard et le desir du jeu; un peu avant d'arriver a moi, elle se laissa glisser sur la glace et, soit pour mieux garder son equilibre, soit parce qu'elle trouvait cela plus gracieux, ou par affectation du maintien d'une patineuse, c'est les bras grands ouverts qu'elle avancait en souriant, comme si elle avait voulu m'y recevoir. Brava! Brava! ca c'est tres bien, je dirais comme vous que c'est chic, que c'est crane, si je n'etais pas d'un autre temps, du temps de l'ancien regime, s'ecria la vieille dame prenant la parole au nom des Champs-Elysees silencieux pour remercier Gilberte d'etre venue sans se laisser intimider par le temps. Vous etes comme moi, fidele quand meme a nos vieux Champs-Elysees; nous sommes deux intrepides. Si je vous disais que je les aime, meme ainsi. Cette neige, vous allez rire de moi, ca me fait penser a de l'hermine! Et la vieille dame se mit a rire. Le premier de ces jours--auxquels la neige, image des puissances qui pouvaient me priver de voir Gilberte, donnait la tristesse d'un jour de separation et jusqu'a l'aspect d'un jour de depart parce qu'il changeait la figure et empechait presque l'usage du lieu habituel de nos seules entrevues maintenant change, tout enveloppe de housses--, ce jour fit pourtant faire un progres a mon amour, car il fut comme un premier chagrin qu'elle eut partage avec moi. Il n'y avait que nous deux de notre bande, et etre ainsi le seul qui fut avec elle, c'etait non seulement comme un commencement d'intimite, mais aussi de sa part,--comme si elle ne fut venue rien que pour moi par un temps pareil--cela me semblait aussi touchant que si un de ces jours ou elle etait invitee a une matinee, elle y avait renonce pour venir me retrouver aux Champs-Elysees; je prenais plus de confiance en la vitalite et en l'avenir de notre amitie qui restait vivace au milieu de l'engourdissement, de la solitude et de la ruine des choses environnantes; et tandis qu'elle me mettait des boules de neige dans le cou, je souriais avec attendrissement a ce qui me semblait a la fois une predilection qu'elle me marquait en me tolerant comme compagnon de voyage dans ce pays hivernal et nouveau, et une sorte de fidelite qu'elle me gardait au milieu du malheur. Bientot l'une apres l'autre, comme des moineaux hesitants, ses amies arriverent toutes noires sur la neige. Nous commencames a jouer et comme ce jour si tristement commence devait finir dans la joie, comme je m'approchais, avant de jouer aux barres, de l'amie a la voix breve que j'avais entendue le premier jour crier le nom de Gilberte, elle me dit: Non, non, on sait bien que vous aimez mieux etre dans le camp de Gilberte, d'ailleurs vous voyez elle vous fait signe. Elle m'appelait en effet pour que je vinsse sur la pelouse de neige, dans son camp, dont le soleil en lui donnant les reflets roses, l'usure metallique des brocarts anciens, faisait un camp du drap d'or. Ce jour que j'avais tant redoute fut au contraire un des seuls ou je ne fus pas trop malheureux. Car, moi qui ne pensais plus qu'a ne jamais rester un jour sans voir Gilberte (au point qu'une fois ma grand'mere n'etant pas rentree pour l'heure du diner, je ne pus m'empecher de me dire tout de suite que si elle avait ete ecrasee par une voiture, je ne pourrais pas aller de quelque temps aux Champs-Elysees; on n'aime plus personne des qu'on aime) pourtant ces moments ou j'etais aupres d'elle et que depuis la veille j'avais si impatiemment attendus, pour lesquels j'avais tremble, auxquels j'aurais sacrifie tout le reste, n'etaient nullement des moments heureux; et je le savais bien car c'etait les seuls moments de ma vie sur lesquels je concentrasse une attention meticuleuse, acharnee, et elle ne decouvrait pas en eux un atome de plaisir. Tout le temps que j'etais loin de Gilberte, j'avais besoin de la voir, parce que cherchant sans cesse a me representer son image, je finissais par ne plus y reussir, et par ne plus savoir exactement a quoi correspondait mon amour. Puis, elle ne m'avait encore jamais dit qu'elle m'aimait. Bien au contraire, elle avait souvent pretendu qu'elle avait des amis qu'elle me preferait, que j'etais un bon camarade avec qui elle jouait volontiers quoique trop distrait, pas assez au jeu; enfin elle m'avait donne souvent des marques apparentes de froideur qui auraient pu ebranler ma croyance que j'etais pour elle un etre different des autres, si cette croyance avait pris sa source dans un amour que Gilberte aurait eu pour moi, et non pas, comme cela etait, dans l'amour que j'avais pour elle, ce qui la rendait autrement resistante, puisque cela la faisait dependre de la maniere meme dont j'etais oblige, par une necessite interieure, de penser a Gilberte. Mais les sentiments que je ressentais pour elle, moi-meme je ne les lui avais pas encore declares. Certes, a toutes les pages de mes cahiers, j'ecrivais indefiniment son nom et son adresse, mais a la vue de ces vagues lignes que je tracais sans qu'elle pensat pour cela a moi, qui lui faisaient prendre autour de moi tant de place apparente sans qu'elle fut melee davantage a ma vie, je me sentais decourage parce qu'elles ne me parlaient pas de Gilberte qui ne les verrait meme pas, mais de mon propre desir qu'elles semblaient me montrer comme quelque chose de purement personnel, d'irreel, de fastidieux et d'impuissant. Le plus presse etait que nous nous vissions Gilberte et moi, et que nous puissions nous faire l'aveu reciproque de notre amour, qui jusque-la n'aurait pour ainsi dire pas commence. Sans doute les diverses raisons qui me rendaient si impatient de la voir auraient ete moins imperieuses pour un homme mur. Plus tard, il arrive que devenus habiles dans la culture de nos plaisirs, nous nous contentions de celui que nous avons a penser a une femme comme je pensais a Gilberte, sans etre inquiets de savoir si cette image correspond a la realite, et aussi de celui de l'aimer sans avoir besoin d'etre certain qu'elle nous aime; ou encore que nous renoncions au plaisir de lui avouer notre inclination pour elle, afin d'entretenir plus vivace l'inclination qu'elle a pour nous, imitant ces jardiniers japonais qui pour obtenir une plus belle fleur, en sacrifient plusieurs autres. Mais a l'epoque ou j'aimais Gilberte, je croyais encore que l'Amour existait reellement en dehors de nous; que, en permettant tout au plus que nous ecartions les obstacles, il offrait ses bonheurs dans un ordre auquel on n'etait pas libre de rien changer; il me semblait que si j'avais, de mon chef, substitue a la douceur de l'aveu la simulation de l'indifference, je ne me serais pas seulement prive d'une des joies dont j'avais le plus reve mais que je me serais fabrique a ma guise un amour factice et sans valeur, sans communication avec le vrai, dont j'aurais renonce a suivre les chemins mysterieux et preexistants. Mais quand j'arrivais aux Champs-Elysees,--et que d'abord j'allais pouvoir confronter mon amour pour lui faire subir les rectifications necessaires a sa cause vivante, independante de moi--, des que j'etais en presence de cette Gilberte Swann sur la vue de laquelle j'avais compte pour rafraichir les images que ma memoire fatiguee ne retrouvait plus, de cette Gilberte Swann avec qui j'avais joue hier, et que venait de me faire saluer et reconnaitre un instinct aveugle comme celui qui dans la marche nous met un pied devant l'autre avant que nous ayons eu le temps de penser, aussitot tout se passait comme si elle et la fillette qui etait l'objet de mes reves avaient ete deux etres differents. Par exemple si depuis la veille je portais dans ma memoire deux yeux de feu dans des joues pleines et brillantes, la figure de Gilberte m'offrait maintenant avec insistance quelque chose que precisement je ne m'etais pas rappele, un certain effilement aigu du nez qui, s'associant instantanement a d'autres traits, prenait l'importance de ces caracteres qui en histoire naturelle definissent une espece, et la transmuait en une fillette du genre de celles a museau pointu. Tandis que je m'appretais a profiter de cet instant desire pour me livrer, sur l'image de Gilberte que j'avais preparee avant de venir et que je ne retrouvais plus dans ma tete, a la mise au point qui me permettrait dans les longues heures ou j'etais seul d'etre sur que c'etait bien elle que je me rappelais, que c'etait bien mon amour pour elle que j'accroissais peu a peu comme un ouvrage qu'on compose, elle me passait une balle;",4.041102100533618,1.7757376652006118,0.3346087187167012,0.0872495100509272,4.464516129032258,4.0,2.4764110851478356,37.80487804878049,24.0,31.57200018555738,1.2806451612903227,1.0,0.5994187264119808,1550,599,0.3864516129032258,8071,41,21.73373502100889,2746889509.50199,1475236.0416229805,0.7218891725875437,0.6673052056382099,60.12046813532652,14.2655153422502,11.402846931873306,17.34130605822187,18.50030999213218,9.668387096774197,59.159716758457904,8.073170731707316,True,75.0,0.9011815252416756,4.334586466165414,1862.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006474154763128147,0.004521631898057754,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.004110574452779776,0.0071935052923646076,0.006165861679169664,0.12620837808807733,93,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"et comme le philosophe idealiste dont le corps tient compte du monde exterieur a la realite duquel son intelligence ne croit pas, le meme moi qui m'avait fait la saluer avant que je l'eusse identifiee, s'empressait de me faire saisir la balle qu'elle me tendait (comme si elle etait une camarade avec qui j'etais venu jouer, et non une ame sur que j'etais venu rejoindre), me faisait lui tenir par bienseance jusqu'a l'heure ou elle s'en allait, mille propos aimables et insignifiants et m'empechait ainsi, ou de garder le silence pendant lequel j'aurais pu enfin remettre la main sur l'image urgente et egaree, ou de lui dire les paroles qui pouvaient faire faire a notre amour les progres decisifs sur lesquels j'etais chaque fois oblige de ne plus compter que pour l'apres-midi suivante. Il en faisait pourtant quelques-uns. Un jour que nous etions alles avec Gilberte jusqu'a la baraque de notre marchande qui etait particulierement aimable pour nous,--car c'etait chez elle que M. Swann faisait acheter son pain d'epices, et par hygiene, il en consommait beaucoup, souffrant d'un eczema ethnique et de la constipation des Prophetes,--Gilberte me montrait en riant deux petits garcons qui etaient comme le petit coloriste et le petit naturaliste des livres d'enfants. Car l'un ne voulait pas d'un sucre d'orge rouge parce qu'il preferait le violet et l'autre, les larmes aux yeux, refusait une prune que voulait lui acheter sa bonne, parce que, finit-il par dire d'une voix passionnee: J'aime mieux l'autre prune, parce qu'elle a un ver! J'achetai deux billes d'un sou. Je regardais avec admiration, lumineuses et captives dans une sebile isolee, les billes d'agate qui me semblaient precieuses parce qu'elles etaient souriantes et blondes comme des jeunes filles et parce qu'elles coutaient cinquante centimes piece. Gilberte a qui on donnait beaucoup plus d'argent qu'a moi me demanda laquelle je trouvais la plus belle. Elles avaient la transparence et le fondu de la vie. Je n'aurais voulu lui en faire sacrifier aucune. J'aurais aime qu'elle put les acheter, les delivrer toutes. Pourtant je lui en designai une qui avait la couleur de ses yeux. Gilberte la prit, chercha son rayon dore, la caressa, paya sa rancon, mais aussitot me remit sa captive en me disant: Tenez, elle est a vous, je vous la donne, gardez-la comme souvenir. Une autre fois, toujours preoccupe du desir d'entendre la Berma dans une piece classique, je lui avais demande si elle ne possedait pas une brochure ou Bergotte parlait de Racine, et qui ne se trouvait plus dans le commerce. Elle m'avait prie de lui en rappeler le titre exact, et le soir je lui avais adresse un petit telegramme en ecrivant sur l'enveloppe ce nom de Gilberte Swann que j'avais tant de fois trace sur mes cahiers. Le lendemain elle m'apporta dans un paquet noue de faveurs mauves et scelle de cire blanche, la brochure qu'elle avait fait chercher. Vous voyez que c'est bien ce que vous m'avez demande, me dit-elle, tirant de son manchon le telegramme que je lui avais envoye. Mais dans l'adresse de ce pneumatique,--qui, hier encore n'etait rien, n'etait qu'un petit bleu que j'avais ecrit, et qui depuis qu'un telegraphiste l'avait remis au concierge de Gilberte et qu'un domestique l'avait porte jusqu'a sa chambre, etait devenu cette chose sans prix, un des petits bleus qu'elle avait recus ce jour-la,--j'eus peine a reconnaitre les lignes vaines et solitaires de mon ecriture sous les cercles imprimes qu'y avait apposes la poste, sous les inscriptions qu'y avait ajoutees au crayon un des facteurs, signes de realisation effective, cachets du monde exterieur, violettes ceintures symboliques de la vie, qui pour la premiere fois venaient epouser, maintenir, relever, rejouir mon reve. Et il y eut un jour aussi ou elle me dit: Vous savez, vous pouvez m'appeler Gilberte, en tous cas moi, je vous appellerai par votre nom de bapteme. C'est trop genant. Pourtant elle continua encore un moment a se contenter de me dire vous et comme je le lui faisais remarquer, elle sourit, et composant, construisant une phrase comme celles qui dans les grammaires etrangeres n'ont d'autre but que de nous faire employer un mot nouveau, elle la termina par mon petit nom. Et me souvenant plus tard de ce que j'avais senti alors, j'y ai demele l'impression d'avoir ete tenu un instant dans sa bouche, moi-meme, nu, sans plus aucune des modalites sociales qui appartenaient aussi, soit a ses autres camarades, soit, quand elle disait mon nom de famille, a mes parents, et dont ses levres--en l'effort qu'elle faisait, un peu comme son pere, pour articuler les mots qu'elle voulait mettre en valeur--eurent l'air de me depouiller, de me devetir, comme de sa peau un fruit dont on ne peut avaler que la pulpe, tandis que son regard, se mettant au meme degre nouveau d'intimite que prenait sa parole, m'atteignait aussi plus directement, non sans temoigner la conscience, le plaisir et jusque la gratitude qu'il en avait, en se faisant accompagner d'un sourire. Mais au moment meme, je ne pouvais apprecier la valeur de ces plaisirs nouveaux. Ils n'etaient pas donnes par la fillette que j'aimais, au moi qui l'aimait, mais par l'autre, par celle avec qui je jouais, a cet autre moi qui ne possedait ni le souvenir de la vraie Gilberte, ni le cur indisponible qui seul aurait pu savoir le prix d'un bonheur, parce que seul il l'avait desire. Meme apres etre rentre a la maison je ne les goutais pas, car, chaque jour, la necessite qui me faisait esperer que le lendemain j'aurais la contemplation exacte, calme, heureuse de Gilberte, qu'elle m'avouerait enfin son amour, en m'expliquant pour quelles raisons elle avait du me le cacher jusqu'ici, cette meme necessite me forcait a tenir le passe pour rien, a ne jamais regarder que devant moi, a considerer les petits avantages qu'elle m'avait donnes non pas en eux-memes et comme s'ils se suffisaient, mais comme des echelons nouveaux ou poser le pied, qui allaient me permettre de faire un pas de plus en avant et d'atteindre enfin le bonheur que je n'avais pas encore rencontre. Si elle me donnait parfois de ces marques d'amitie, elle me faisait aussi de la peine en ayant l'air de ne pas avoir de plaisir a me voir, et cela arrivait souvent les jours memes sur lesquels j'avais le plus compte pour realiser mes esperances. J'etais sur que Gilberte viendrait aux Champs-Elysees et j'eprouvais une allegresse qui me paraissait seulement la vague anticipation d'un grand bonheur quand,--entrant des le matin au salon pour embrasser maman deja toute prete, la tour de ses cheveux noirs entierement construite, et ses belles mains blanches et potelees sentant encore le savon,--j'avais appris, en voyant une colonne de poussiere se tenir debout toute seule au-dessus du piano, et en entendant un orgue de Barbarie jouer sous la fenetre: En revenant de la revue, que l'hiver recevait jusqu'au soir la visite inopinee et radieuse d'une journee de printemps. Pendant que nous dejeunions, en ouvrant sa croisee, la dame d'en face avait fait decamper en un clin d'il, d'a cote de ma chaise,--rayant d'un seul bond toute la largeur de notre salle a manger--un rayon qui y avait commence sa sieste et etait deja revenu la continuer l'instant d'apres. Au college, a la classe d'une heure, le soleil me faisait languir d'impatience et d'ennui en laissant trainer une lueur doree jusque sur mon pupitre, comme une invitation a la fete ou je ne pourrais arriver avant trois heures, jusqu'au moment ou Francoise venait me chercher a la sortie, et ou nous nous acheminions vers les Champs-Elysees par les rues decorees de lumiere, encombrees par la foule, et ou les balcons, descelles par le soleil et vaporeux, flottaient devant les maisons comme des nuages d'or. Helas! aux Champs-Elysees je ne trouvais pas Gilberte, elle n'etait pas encore arrivee. Immobile sur la pelouse nourrie par le soleil invisible qui ca et la faisait flamboyer la pointe d'un brin d'herbe, et sur laquelle les pigeons qui s'y etaient poses avaient l'air de sculptures antiques que la pioche du jardinier a ramenees a la surface d'un sol auguste, je restais les yeux fixes sur l'horizon, je m'attendais a tout moment a voir apparaitre l'image de Gilberte suivant son institutrice, derriere la statue qui semblait tendre l'enfant qu'elle portait et qui ruisselait de rayons, a la benediction du soleil. La vieille lectrice des Debats etait assise sur son fauteuil, toujours a la meme place, elle interpellait un gardien a qui elle faisait un geste amical de la main en lui criant: Quel joli temps! Et la preposee s'etant approchee d'elle pour percevoir le prix du fauteuil, elle faisait mille minauderies en mettant dans l'ouverture de son gant le ticket de dix centimes comme si c'avait ete un bouquet, pour qui elle cherchait, par amabilite pour le donateur, la place la plus flatteuse possible. Quand elle l'avait trouvee, elle faisait executer une evolution circulaire a son cou, redressait son boa, et plantait sur la chaisiere, en lui montrant le bout de papier jaune qui depassait sur son poignet, le beau sourire dont une femme, en indiquant son corsage a un jeune homme, lui dit: Vous reconnaissez vos roses! J'emmenais Francoise au-devant de Gilberte jusqu'a l'Arc-de-Triomphe, nous ne la rencontrions pas, et je revenais vers la pelouse persuade qu'elle ne viendrait plus, quand, devant les chevaux de bois, la fillette a la voix breve se jetait sur moi: Vite, vite, il y a deja un quart d'heure que Gilberte est arrivee. Elle va repartir bientot. On vous attend pour faire une partie de barres. Pendant que je montais l'avenue des Champs-Elysees, Gilberte etait venue par la rue Boissy-d'Anglas, Mademoiselle ayant profite du beau temps pour faire des courses pour elle; et M. Swann allait venir chercher sa fille. Aussi c'etait ma faute; je n'aurais pas du m'eloigner de la pelouse; car on ne savait jamais surement par quel cote Gilberte viendrait, si ce serait plus ou moins tard, et cette attente finissait",3.691530338243059,1.6498679301017969,0.33630740986837154,0.10785641847025701,4.605433376455369,4.0,2.598053102256772,30.92,25.0,27.431981335660026,1.3040103492884865,1.0,0.6338424352722711,1546,657,0.42496765847347995,8318,50,23.92338438736972,24535438711.34842,12954297.102084698,0.7108190114400825,0.6818477739579976,65.13192445019405,11.856122121604141,10.577609850970193,14.567223803363518,15.721591203104786,10.322639068564037,54.78804657179819,7.38,True,65.0,0.8896515311510031,4.391763463569165,1894.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006414111044297455,0.005612347163760273,0.0,0.1420274551214361,94,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"par me rendre plus emouvants, non seulement les Champs-Elysees entiers et toute la duree de l'apres-midi, comme une immense etendue d'espace et de temps sur chacun des points et a chacun des moments de laquelle il etait possible qu'apparut l'image de Gilberte, mais encore cette image, elle-meme, parce que derriere cette image je sentais se cacher la raison pour laquelle elle m'etait decochee en plein cur, a quatre heures au lieu de deux heures et demie, surmontee d'un chapeau de visite a la place d'un beret de jeu, devant les Ambassadeurs et non entre les deux guignols, je devinais quelqu'une de ces occupations ou je ne pouvais suivre Gilberte et qui la forcaient a sortir ou a rester a la maison, j'etais en contact avec le mystere de sa vie inconnue. C'etait ce mystere aussi qui me troublait quand, courant sur l'ordre de la fillette a la voix breve pour commencer tout de suite notre partie de barres, j'apercevais Gilberte, si vive et brusque avec nous, faisant une reverence a la dame aux Debats (qui lui disait: Quel beau soleil, on dirait du feu), lui parlant avec un sourire timide, d'un air compasse qui m'evoquait la jeune fille differente que Gilberte devait etre chez ses parents, avec les amis de ses parents, en visite, dans toute son autre existence qui m'echappait. Mais de cette existence personne ne me donnait l'impression comme M. Swann qui venait un peu apres pour retrouver sa fille. C'est que lui et Mme Swann,--parce que leur fille habitait chez eux, parce que ses etudes, ses jeux, ses amities dependaient d'eux--contenaient pour moi, comme Gilberte, peut-etre meme plus que Gilberte, comme il convenait a des lieux tout-puissants sur elle en qui il aurait eu sa source, un inconnu inaccessible, un charme douloureux. Tout ce qui les concernait etait de ma part l'objet d'une preoccupation si constante que les jours ou, comme ceux-la, M. Swann (que j'avais vu si souvent autrefois sans qu'il excitat ma curiosite, quand il etait lie avec mes parents) venait chercher Gilberte aux Champs-Elysees, une fois calmes les battements de cur qu'avait excites en moi l'apparition de son chapeau gris et de son manteau a pelerine, son aspect m'impressionnait encore comme celui d'un personnage historique sur lequel nous venons de lire une serie d'ouvrages et dont les moindres particularites nous passionnent. Ses relations avec le comte de Paris qui, quand j'en entendais parler a Combray, me semblaient indifferentes, prenaient maintenant pour moi quelque chose de merveilleux, comme si personne d'autre n'eut jamais connu les Orleans; elles le faisaient se detacher vivement sur le fond vulgaire des promeneurs de differentes classes qui encombraient cette allee des Champs-Elysees, et au milieu desquels j'admirais qu'il consentit a figurer sans reclamer d'eux d'egards speciaux, qu'aucun d'ailleurs ne songeait a lui rendre, tant etait profond l'incognito dont il etait enveloppe. Il repondait poliment aux saluts des camarades de Gilberte, meme au mien quoiqu'il fut brouille avec ma famille, mais sans avoir l'air de me connaitre. (Cela me rappela qu'il m'avait pourtant vu bien souvent a la campagne; souvenir que j'avais garde mais dans l'ombre, parce que depuis que j'avais revu Gilberte, pour moi Swann etait surtout son pere, et non plus le Swann de Combray; comme les idees sur lesquelles j'embranchais maintenant son nom etaient differentes des idees dans le reseau desquelles il etait autrefois compris et que je n'utilisais plus jamais quand j'avais a penser a lui, il etait devenu un personnage nouveau; je le rattachai pourtant par une ligne artificielle secondaire et transversale a notre invite d'autrefois; et comme rien n'avait plus pour moi de prix que dans la mesure ou mon amour pouvait en profiter, ce fut avec un mouvement de honte et le regret de ne pouvoir les effacer que je retrouvai les annees ou, aux yeux de ce meme Swann qui etait en ce moment devant moi aux Champs-Elysees et a qui heureusement Gilberte n'avait peut-etre pas dit mon nom, je m'etais si souvent le soir rendu ridicule en envoyant demander a maman de monter dans ma chambre me dire bonsoir, pendant qu'elle prenait le cafe avec lui, mon pere et mes grands-parents a la table du jardin.) Il disait a Gilberte qu'il lui permettait de faire une partie, qu'il pouvait attendre un quart d'heure, et s'asseyant comme tout le monde sur une chaise de fer payait son ticket de cette main que Philippe VII avait si souvent retenue dans la sienne, tandis que nous commencions a jouer sur la pelouse, faisant envoler les pigeons dont les beaux corps irises qui ont la forme d'un cur et sont comme les lilas du regne des oiseaux, venaient se refugier comme en des lieux d'asile, tel sur le grand vase de pierre a qui son bec en y disparaissant faisait faire le geste et assignait la destination d'offrir en abondance les fruits ou les graines qu'il avait l'air d'y picorer, tel autre sur le front de la statue, qu'il semblait surmonter d'un de ces objets en email desquels la polychromie varie dans certaines uvres antiques la monotonie de la pierre et d'un attribut qui, quand la deesse le porte, lui vaut une epithete particuliere et en fait, comme pour une mortelle un prenom different, une divinite nouvelle. Un de ces jours de soleil qui n'avait pas realise mes esperances, je n'eus pas le courage de cacher ma deception a Gilberte. --J'avais justement beaucoup de choses a vous demander, lui dis-je. Je croyais que ce jour compterait beaucoup dans notre amitie. Et aussitot arrivee, vous allez partir! Tachez de venir demain de bonne heure, que je puisse enfin vous parler. Sa figure resplendit et ce fut en sautant de joie qu'elle me repondit: --Demain, comptez-y, mon bel ami, mais je ne viendrai pas! j'ai un grand gouter; apres-demain non plus, je vais chez une amie pour voir de ses fenetres l'arrivee du roi Theodose, ce sera superbe, et le lendemain encore a Michel Strogoff et puis apres, cela va etre bientot Noel et les vacances du jour de l'An. Peut-etre on va m'emmener dans le midi. Ce que ce serait chic! quoique cela me fera manquer un arbre de Noel; en tous cas si je reste a Paris, je ne viendrai pas ici car j'irai faire des visites avec maman. Adieu, voila papa qui m'appelle. Je revins avec Francoise par les rues qui etaient encore pavoisees de soleil, comme au soir d'une fete qui est finie. Je ne pouvais pas trainer mes jambes. --Ca n'est pas etonnant, dit Francoise, ce n'est pas un temps de saison, il fait trop chaud. Helas! mon Dieu, de partout il doit y avoir bien des pauvres malades, c'est a croire que la-haut aussi tout se detraque. Je me redisais en etouffant mes sanglots les mots ou Gilberte avait laisse eclater sa joie de ne pas venir de longtemps aux Champs-Elysees. Mais deja le charme dont, par son simple fonctionnement, se remplissait mon esprit des qu'il songeait a elle, la position particuliere, unique,--fut elle affligeante,--ou me placait inevitablement par rapport a Gilberte, la contrainte interne d'un pli mental, avaient commence a ajouter, meme a cette marque d'indifference, quelque chose de romanesque, et au milieu de mes larmes se formait un sourire qui n'etait que l'ebauche timide d'un baiser. Et quand vint l'heure du courrier, je me dis ce soir-la comme tous les autres: Je vais recevoir une lettre de Gilberte, elle va me dire enfin qu'elle n'a jamais cesse de m'aimer, et m'expliquera la raison mysterieuse pour laquelle elle a ete forcee de me le cacher jusqu'ici, de faire semblant de pouvoir etre heureuse sans me voir, la raison pour laquelle elle a pris l'apparence de la Gilberte simple camarade. Tous les soirs je me plaisais a imaginer cette lettre, je croyais la lire, je m'en recitais chaque phrase. Tout d'un coup je m'arretais effraye. Je comprenais que si je devais recevoir une lettre de Gilberte, ce ne pourrait pas en tous cas etre celle-la puisque c'etait moi qui venais de la composer. Et des lors, je m'efforcais de detourner ma pensee des mots que j'aurais aime qu'elle m'ecrivit, par peur en les enoncant, d'exclure justement ceux-la,--les plus chers, les plus desires--, du champ des realisations possibles. Meme si par une invraisemblable coincidence, c'eut ete justement la lettre que j'avais inventee que de son cote m'eut adressee Gilberte, y reconnaissant mon uvre je n'eusse pas eu l'impression de recevoir quelque chose qui ne vint pas de moi, quelque chose de reel, de nouveau, un bonheur exterieur a mon esprit, independant de ma volonte, vraiment donne par l'amour. En attendant je relisais une page que ne m'avait pas ecrite Gilberte, mais qui du moins me venait d'elle, cette page de Bergotte sur la beaute des vieux mythes dont s'est inspire Racine, et que, a cote de la bille d'agathe, je gardais toujours aupres de moi. J'etais attendri par la bonte de mon amie qui me l'avait fait rechercher; et comme chacun a besoin de trouver des raisons a sa passion, jusqu'a etre heureux de reconnaitre dans l'etre qu'il aime des qualites que la litterature ou la conversation lui ont appris etre de celles qui sont dignes d'exciter l'amour, jusqu'a les assimiler par imitation et en faire des raisons nouvelles de son amour, ces qualites fussent-elles les plus oppressees a celles que cet amour eut recherchees tant qu'il etait spontane--comme Swann autrefois le caractere esthetique de la beaute d'Odette,--moi, qui avais d'abord aime Gilberte, des Combray, a cause de tout l'inconnu de sa vie, dans lequel j'aurais voulu me precipiter, m'incarner, en delaissant la mienne qui ne m'etait plus rien, je pensais maintenant comme a un inestimable avantage, que de cette mienne vie trop connue, dedaignee, Gilberte pourrait devenir un jour l'humble servante, la commode et confortable collaboratrice, qui le soir m'aidant dans mes travaux, collationnerait pour moi des brochures. Quant a Bergotte, ce vieillard infiniment sage et presque divin a cause de qui j'avais d'abord aime Gilberte, avant meme de l'avoir vue, maintenant c'etait",3.7715647815356084,1.8915575634045287,0.3255568123895856,0.09815510766493739,4.568400770712909,4.0,2.6104337505550026,34.6,21.0,41.55660129403163,1.3147077713551703,1.0,0.6607605396134965,1557,625,0.40141297366730894,8283,45,24.223437023175507,33121121353.285206,17441348.790566195,0.6443780524529178,0.6334039237956668,60.49172254335261,13.417551701991012,11.429527900616531,16.28059087989724,17.387167630057803,10.206705202312136,57.59293513166345,7.955555555555556,True,72.0,0.8894154818325435,4.361769352290679,1899.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012068792115055817,0.00643668912802977,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.011767072312179423,0.00704012873378256,0.005430956451775118,0.1358609794628752,95,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"surtout a cause de Gilberte que je l'aimais. Avec autant de plaisir que les pages qu'il avait ecrites sur Racine, je regardais le papier ferme de grands cachets de cire blancs et noue d'un flot de rubans mauves dans lequel elle me les avait apportees. Je baisais la bille d'agate qui etait la meilleure part du cur de mon amie, la part qui n'etait pas frivole, mais fidele, et qui bien que paree du charme mysterieux de la vie de Gilberte demeurait pres de moi, habitait ma chambre, couchait dans mon lit. Mais la beaute de cette pierre, et la beaute aussi de ces pages de Bergotte, que j'etais heureux d'associer a l'idee de mon amour pour Gilberte comme si dans les moments ou celui-ci ne m'apparaissait plus que comme un neant, elles lui donnaient une sorte de consistance, je m'apercevais qu'elles etaient anterieures a cet amour, qu'elles ne lui ressemblaient pas, que leurs elements avaient ete fixes par le talent ou par les lois mineralogiques avant que Gilberte ne me connut, que rien dans le livre ni dans la pierre n'eut ete autre si Gilberte ne m'avait pas aime et que rien par consequent ne m'autorisait a lire en eux un message de bonheur. Et tandis que mon amour attendant sans cesse du lendemain l'aveu de celui de Gilberte, annulait, defaisait chaque soir le travail mal fait de la journee, dans l'ombre de moi-meme une ouvriere inconnue ne laissait pas au rebut les fils arraches et les disposait, sans souci de me plaire et de travailler a mon bonheur, dans un ordre different qu'elle donnait a tous ses ouvrages. Ne portant aucun interet particulier a mon amour, ne commencant pas par decider que j'etais aime, elle recueillait les actions de Gilberte qui m'avaient semble inexplicables et ses fautes que j'avais excusees. Alors les unes et les autres prenaient un sens. Il semblait dire, cet ordre nouveau, qu'en voyant Gilberte, au lieu qu'elle vint aux Champs-Elysees, aller a une matinee, faire des courses avec son institutrice et se preparer a une absence pour les vacances du jour de l'an, j'avais tort de penser, me dire: c'est qu'elle est frivole ou docile. Car elle eut cesse d'etre l'un ou l'autre si elle m'avait aime, et si elle avait ete forcee d'obeir c'eut ete avec le meme desespoir que j'avais les jours ou je ne la voyais pas. Il disait encore, cet ordre nouveau, que je devais pourtant savoir ce que c'etait qu'aimer puisque j'aimais Gilberte; il me faisait remarquer le souci perpetuel que j'avais de me faire valoir a ses yeux, a cause duquel j'essayais de persuader a ma mere d'acheter a Francoise un caoutchouc et un chapeau avec un plumet bleu, ou plutot de ne plus m'envoyer aux Champs-Elysees avec cette bonne dont je rougissais (a quoi ma mere repondait que j'etais injuste pour Francoise, que c'etait une brave femme qui nous etait devouee), et aussi ce besoin unique de voir Gilberte qui faisait que des mois d'avance je ne pensais qu'a tacher d'apprendre a quelle epoque elle quitterait Paris et ou elle irait, trouvant le pays le plus agreable un lieu d'exil si elle ne devait pas y etre, et ne desirant que rester toujours a Paris tant que je pourrais la voir aux Champs-Elysees; et il n'avait pas de peine a me montrer que ce souci-la, ni ce besoin, je ne les trouverais sous les actions de Gilberte. Elle au contraire appreciait son institutrice, sans s'inquieter de ce que j'en pensais. Elle trouvait naturel de ne pas venir aux Champs-Elysees, si c'etait pour aller faire des emplettes avec Mademoiselle, agreable si c'etait pour sortir avec sa mere. Et a supposer meme qu'elle m'eut permis d'aller passer les vacances au meme endroit qu'elle, du moins pour choisir cet endroit elle s'occupait du desir de ses parents, de mille amusements dont on lui avait parle et nullement que ce fut celui ou ma famille avait l'intention de m'envoyer. Quand elle m'assurait parfois qu'elle m'aimait moins qu'un de ses amis, moins qu'elle ne m'aimait la veille parce que je lui avais fait perdre sa partie par une negligence, je lui demandais pardon, je lui demandais ce qu'il fallait faire pour qu'elle recommencat a m'aimer autant, pour qu'elle m'aimat plus que les autres; je voulais qu'elle me dit que c'etait deja fait, je l'en suppliais comme si elle avait pu modifier son affection pour moi a son gre, au mien, pour me faire plaisir, rien que par les mots qu'elle dirait, selon ma bonne ou ma mauvaise conduite. Ne savais-je donc pas que ce que j'eprouvais, moi, pour elle, ne dependait ni de ses actions, ni de ma volonte? Il disait enfin, l'ordre nouveau dessine par l'ouvriere invisible, que si nous pouvons desirer que les actions d'une personne qui nous a peines jusqu'ici n'aient pas ete sinceres, il y a dans leur suite une clarte contre quoi notre desir ne peut rien et a laquelle, plutot qu'a lui, nous devons demander quelles seront ses actions de demain. Ces paroles nouvelles, mon amour les entendait; elles le persuadaient que le lendemain ne serait pas different de ce qu'avaient ete tous les autres jours; que le sentiment de Gilberte pour moi, trop ancien deja pour pouvoir changer, c'etait l'indifference; que dans mon amitie avec Gilberte, c'est moi seul qui aimais. C'est vrai, repondait mon amour, il n'y a plus rien a faire de cette amitie-la, elle ne changera pas. Alors des le lendemain (ou attendant une fete s'il y en avait une prochaine, un anniversaire, le nouvel an peut-etre, un de ces jours qui ne sont pas pareils aux autres, ou le temps recommence sur de nouveaux frais en rejetant l'heritage du passe, en n'acceptant pas le legs de ses tristesses) je demandais a Gilberte de renoncer a notre amitie ancienne et de jeter les bases d'une nouvelle amitie. J'avais toujours a portee de ma main un plan de Paris qui, parce qu'on pouvait y distinguer la rue ou habitaient M. et Mme Swann, me semblait contenir un tresor. Et par plaisir, par une sorte de fidelite chevaleresque aussi, a propos de n'importe quoi, je disais le nom de cette rue, si bien que mon pere me demandait, n'etant pas comme ma mere et ma grand'mere au courant de mon amour: --Mais pourquoi parles-tu tout le temps de cette rue, elle n'a rien d'extraordinaire, elle est tres agreable a habiter parce qu'elle est a deux pas du Bois, mais il y en a dix autres dans le meme cas. Je m'arrangeais a tout propos a faire prononcer a mes parents le nom de Swann: certes je me le repetais mentalement sans cesse: mais j'avais besoin aussi d'entendre sa sonorite delicieuse et de me faire jouer cette musique dont la lecture muette ne me suffisait pas. Ce nom de Swann d'ailleurs que je connaissais depuis si longtemps, etait maintenant pour moi, ainsi qu'il arrive a certains aphasiques a l'egard des mots les plus usuels, un nom nouveau. Il etait toujours present a ma pensee et pourtant elle ne pouvait pas s'habituer a lui. Je le decomposais, je l'epelais, son orthographe etait pour moi une surprise. Et en meme temps que d'etre familier, il avait cesse de me paraitre innocent. Les joies que je prenais a l'entendre, je les croyais si coupables, qu'il me semblait qu'on devinait ma pensee et qu'on changeait la conversation si je cherchais a l'y amener. Je me rabattais sur les sujets qui touchaient encore a Gilberte, je rabachais sans fin les memes paroles, et j'avais beau savoir que ce n'etait que des paroles,--des paroles prononcees loin d'elle, qu'elle n'entendait pas, des paroles sans vertu qui repetaient ce qui etait, mais ne le pouvaient modifier,--pourtant il me semblait qu'a force de manier, de brasser ainsi tout ce qui avoisinait Gilberte j'en ferais peut-etre sortir quelque chose d'heureux. Je redisais a mes parents que Gilberte aimait bien son institutrice, comme si cette proposition enoncee pour la centieme fois allait avoir enfin pour effet de faire brusquement entrer Gilberte venant a tout jamais vivre avec nous. Je reprenais l'eloge de la vieille dame qui lisait les Debats (j'avais insinue a mes parents que c'etait une ambassadrice ou peut-etre une altesse) et je continuais a celebrer sa beaute, sa magnificence, sa noblesse, jusqu'au jour ou je dis que d'apres le nom qu'avait prononce Gilberte elle devait s'appeler Mme Blatin. --Oh! mais je vois ce que c'est, s'ecria ma mere tandis que je me sentais rougir de honte. A la garde! A la garde! comme aurait dit ton pauvre grand-pere. Et c'est elle que tu trouves belle! Mais elle est horrible et elle l'a toujours ete. C'est la veuve d'un huissier. Tu ne te rappelles pas quand tu etais enfant les maneges que je faisais pour l'eviter a la lecon de gymnastique ou, sans me connaitre, elle voulait venir me parler sous pretexte de me dire que tu etais trop beau pour un garcon. Elle a toujours eu la rage de connaitre du monde et il faut bien qu'elle soit une espece de folle comme j'ai toujours pense, si elle connait vraiment Mme Swann. Car si elle etait d'un milieu fort commun, au moins il n'y a jamais rien eu que je sache a dire sur elle. Mais il fallait toujours qu'elle se fasse des relations. Elle est horrible, affreusement vulgaire, et avec cela faiseuse d'embarras. Quant a Swann, pour tacher de lui ressembler, je passais tout mon temps a table, a me tirer sur le nez et a me frotter les yeux. Mon pere disait: cet enfant est idiot, il deviendra affreux. J'aurais surtout voulu etre aussi chauve que Swann. Il me semblait un etre si extraordinaire que je trouvais merveilleux que des personnes que je frequentais le connussent aussi et que dans les hasards d'une journee quelconque on put etre amene a le rencontrer. Et une fois, ma mere, en train de nous raconter comme chaque soir a diner, les courses qu'elle avait faites dans",3.938332649190668,1.8171788238872764,0.3138450007630042,0.10021711845793538,4.35658409387223,4.0,2.509687683558223,27.392857142857142,22.0,21.83188900555837,1.2770534550195567,1.0,0.6037973498168242,1534,555,0.3617992177314211,7908,56,24.454083528244205,41713202745.59644,22294603.284658708,0.7470210833982988,0.7389821261167526,70.99252770534551,10.162445054945056,9.516144504307135,12.782436207859938,12.785939653566771,8.736140808344203,47.34070590426522,5.464285714285714,True,92.0,0.8968466060929984,4.226616782469268,1871.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.008152173913043478,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.006897993311036789,0.00459866220735786,0.007525083612040134,0.13842864778193478,96,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"l'apres-midi, rien qu'en disant: A ce propos, devinez qui j'ai rencontre aux Trois Quartiers, au rayon des parapluies: Swann, fit eclore au milieu de son recit, fort aride pour moi, une fleur mysterieuse. Quelle melancolique volupte, d'apprendre que cet apres-midi-la, profilant dans la foule sa forme surnaturelle, Swann avait ete acheter un parapluie. Au milieu des evenements grands et minimes, egalement indifferents, celui-la eveillait en moi ces vibrations particulieres dont etait perpetuellement emu mon amour pour Gilberte. Mon pere disait que je ne m'interessais a rien parce que je n'ecoutais pas quand on parlait des consequences politiques que pouvait avoir la visite du roi Theodose, en ce moment l'hote de la France et, pretendait-on, son allie. Mais combien en revanche, j'avais envie de savoir si Swann avait son manteau a pelerine! --Est-ce que vous vous etes dit bonjour? demandai-je. --Mais naturellement, repondit ma mere qui avait toujours l'air de craindre que si elle eut avoue que nous etions en froid avec Swann, on eut cherche a les reconcilier plus qu'elle ne souhaitait, a cause de Mme Swann qu'elle ne voulait pas connaitre. C'est lui qui est venu me saluer, je ne le voyais pas. --Mais alors, vous n'etes pas brouilles? --Brouilles? mais pourquoi veux-tu que nous soyons brouilles, repondit-elle vivement comme si j'avais attente a la fiction de ses bons rapports avec Swann et essaye de travailler a un rapprochement. --Il pourrait t'en vouloir de ne plus l'inviter. --On n'est pas oblige d'inviter tout le monde; est-ce qu'il m'invite? Je ne connais pas sa femme. --Mais il venait bien a Combray. --Eh bien oui! il venait a Combray, et puis a Paris il a autre chose a faire et moi aussi. Mais je t'assure que nous n'avions pas du tout l'air de deux personnes brouillees. Nous sommes restes un moment ensemble parce qu'on ne lui apportait pas son paquet. Il m'a demande de tes nouvelles, il m'a dit que tu jouais avec sa fille, ajouta ma mere, m'emerveillant du prodige que j'existasse dans l'esprit de Swann, bien plus, que ce fut d'une facon assez complete, pour que, quand je tremblais d'amour devant lui aux Champs-Elysees, il sut mon nom, qui etait ma mere, et put amalgamer autour de ma qualite de camarade de sa fille quelques renseignements sur mes grands-parents, leur famille, l'endroit que nous habitions, certaines particularites de notre vie d'autrefois, peut-etre meme inconnues de moi. Mais ma mere ne paraissait pas avoir trouve un charme particulier a ce rayon des Trois Quartiers ou elle avait represente pour Swann, au moment ou il l'avait vue, une personne definie avec qui il avait des souvenirs communs qui avaient motive chez lui le mouvement de s'approcher d'elle, le geste de la saluer. Ni elle d'ailleurs ni mon pere ne semblaient non plus trouver a parler des grands-parents de Swann, du titre d'agent de change honoraire, un plaisir qui passat tous les autres. Mon imagination avait isole et consacre dans le Paris social une certaine famille comme elle avait fait dans le Paris de pierre pour une certaine maison dont elle avait sculpte la porte cochere et rendu precieuses les fenetres. Mais ces ornements, j'etais seul a les voir. De meme que mon pere et ma mere trouvaient la maison qu'habitait Swann pareille aux autres maisons construites en meme temps dans le quartier du Bois, de meme la famille de Swann leur semblait du meme genre que beaucoup d'autres familles d'agents de change. Ils la jugeaient plus ou moins favorablement selon le degre ou elle avait participe a des merites communs au reste de l'univers et ne lui trouvaient rien d'unique. Ce qu'au contraire ils y appreciaient, ils le rencontraient a un degre egal, ou plus eleve, ailleurs. Aussi apres avoir trouve la maison bien situee, ils parlaient d'une autre qui l'etait mieux, mais qui n'avait rien a voir avec Gilberte, ou de financiers d'un cran superieur a son grand-pere; et s'ils avaient eu l'air un moment d'etre du meme avis que moi, c'etait par un malentendu qui ne tardait pas a se dissiper. C'est que, pour percevoir dans tout ce qui entourait Gilberte, une qualite inconnue analogue dans le monde des emotions a ce que peut etre dans celui des couleurs l'infra-rouge, mes parents etaient depourvus de ce sens supplementaire et momentane dont m'avait dote l'amour. Les jours ou Gilberte m'avait annonce qu'elle ne devait pas venir aux Champs-Elysees, je tachais de faire des promenades qui me rapprochassent un peu d'elle. Parfois j'emmenais Francoise en pelerinage devant la maison qu'habitaient les Swann. Je lui faisais repeter sans fin ce que, par l'institutrice, elle avait appris relativement a Mme Swann. Il parait qu'elle a bien confiance a des medailles. Jamais elle ne partira en voyage si elle a entendu la chouette, ou bien comme un tic-tac d'horloge dans le mur, ou si elle a vu un chat a minuit, ou si le bois d'un meuble, il a craque. Ah! c'est une personne tres croyante! J'etais si amoureux de Gilberte que si sur le chemin j'apercevais leur vieux maitre d'hotel promenant un chien, l'emotion m'obligeait a m'arreter, j'attachais sur ses favoris blancs des regards pleins de passion. Francoise me disait: --Qu'est-ce que vous avez? Puis, nous poursuivions notre route jusque devant leur porte cochere ou un concierge different de tout concierge, et penetre jusque dans les galons de sa livree du meme charme douloureux que j'avais ressenti dans le nom de Gilberte, avait l'air de savoir que j'etais de ceux a qui une indignite originelle interdirait toujours de penetrer dans la vie mysterieuse qu'il etait charge de garder et sur laquelle les fenetres de l'entre-sol paraissaient conscientes d'etre refermees, ressemblant beaucoup moins entre la noble retombee de leurs rideaux de mousseline a n'importe quelles autres fenetres, qu'aux regards de Gilberte. D'autres fois nous allions sur les boulevards et je me postais a l'entree de la rue Duphot; on m'avait dit qu'on pouvait souvent y voir passer Swann se rendant chez son dentiste; et mon imagination differenciait tellement le pere de Gilberte du reste de l'humanite, sa presence au milieu du monde reel y introduisait tant de merveilleux, que, avant meme d'arriver a la Madeleine, j'etais emu a la pensee d'approcher d'une rue ou pouvait se produire inopinement l'apparition surnaturelle. Mais le plus souvent,--quand je ne devais pas voir Gilberte--comme j'avais appris que Mme Swann se promenait presque chaque jour dans l'allee des Acacias, autour du grand Lac, et dans l'allee de la Reine Marguerite, je dirigeais Francoise du cote du bois de Boulogne. Il etait pour moi comme ces jardins zoologiques ou l'on voit rassembles des flores diverses et des paysages opposes; ou, apres une colline on trouve une grotte, un pre, des rochers, une riviere, une fosse, une colline, un marais, mais ou l'on sait qu'ils ne sont la que pour fournir aux ebats de l'hippopotame, des zebres, des crocodiles, des lapins russes, des ours et du heron, un milieu approprie ou un cadre pittoresque; lui, le Bois, complexe aussi, reunissant des petits mondes divers et clos,--faisant succeder quelque ferme plantee d'arbres rouges, de chenes d'Amerique, comme une exploitation agricole dans la Virginie, a une sapiniere au bord du lac, ou a une futaie d'ou surgit tout a coup dans sa souple fourrure, avec les beaux yeux d'une bete, quelque promeneuse rapide,--il etait le Jardin des femmes; et,--comme l'allee de Myrtes de l'Eneide,--plantee pour elles d'arbres d'une seule essence, l'allee des Acacias etait frequentee par les Beautes celebres. Comme, de loin, la culmination du rocher d'ou elle se jette dans l'eau, transporte de joie les enfants qui savent qu'ils vont voir l'otarie, bien avant d'arriver a l'allee des Acacias, leur parfum qui, irradiant alentour, faisait sentir de loin l'approche et la singularite d'une puissante et molle individualite vegetale; puis, quand je me rapprochais, le faite apercu de leur frondaison legere et mievre, d'une elegance facile, d'une coupe coquette et d'un mince tissu, sur laquelle des centaines de fleurs s'etaient abattues comme des colonies ailees et vibratiles de parasites precieux; enfin jusqu'a leur nom feminin, desuvre et doux, me faisaient battre le cur mais d'un desir mondain, comme ces valses qui ne nous evoquent plus que le nom des belles invitees que l'huissier annonce a l'entree d'un bal. On m'avait dit que je verrais dans l'allee certaines elegantes que, bien qu'elles n'eussent pas toutes ete epousees, l'on citait habituellement a cote de Mme Swann, mais le plus souvent sous leur nom de guerre; leur nouveau nom, quand il y en avait un, n'etait qu'une sorte d'incognito que ceux qui voulaient parler d'elles avaient soin de lever pour se faire comprendre. Pensant que le Beau--dans l'ordre des elegances feminines--etait regi par des lois occultes a la connaissance desquelles elles avaient ete initiees, et qu'elles avaient le pouvoir de le realiser, j'acceptais d'avance comme une revelation l'apparition de leur toilette, de leur attelage, de mille details au sein desquels je mettais ma croyance comme une ame interieure qui donnait la cohesion d'un chef-d'uvre a cet ensemble ephemere et mouvant. Mais c'est Mme Swann que je voulais voir, et j'attendais qu'elle passat, emu comme si c'avait ete Gilberte, dont les parents, impregnes comme tout ce qui l'entourait, de son charme, excitaient en moi autant d'amour qu'elle, meme un trouble plus douloureux (parce que leur point de contact avec elle etait cette partie intestine de sa vie qui m'etait interdite), et enfin (car je sus bientot, comme on le verra, qu'ils n'aimaient pas que je jouasse avec elle), ce sentiment de veneration que nous vouons toujours a ceux qui exercent sans frein la puissance de nous faire du mal. J'assignais la premiere place a la simplicite, dans l'ordre des merites esthetiques et des grandeurs mondaines quand j'apercevais Mme Swann a pied, dans une polonaise de drap, sur la tete un petit toquet agremente d'une aile de lophophore, un bouquet de violettes au corsage, pressee, traversant l'allee des Acacias comme si c'avait ete seulement le chemin le plus court pour rentrer chez elle et repondant d'un clin d'il aux",3.8309328893491617,1.8951883310169253,0.32755500652400876,0.08573205822787683,4.64748201438849,4.0,2.682086105419407,28.314814814814813,23.0,25.62827147975026,1.3302812295618052,1.0,0.6689448653503072,1529,637,0.41661216481360364,8518,54,25.530790286172344,122428164927.6364,63931156.62017567,0.6550657130637259,0.651786304723758,65.55367094203427,11.150096286607077,10.980518767755715,13.99433665189061,14.617047695177192,10.481805101373446,51.728810890681395,6.62962962962963,True,64.0,0.8819843342036554,4.448041775456919,1915.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.003733542935743761,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.002751031636863824,0.007467085871487522,0.0,0.1566579634464752,97,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"messieurs en voiture qui, reconnaissant de loin sa silhouette, la saluaient et se disaient que personne n'avait autant de chic. Mais au lieu de la simplicite, c'est le faste que je mettais au plus haut rang, si, apres que j'avais force Francoise, qui n'en pouvait plus et disait que les jambes lui rentraient, a faire les cent pas pendant une heure, je voyais enfin, debouchant de l'allee qui vient de la Porte Dauphine--image pour moi d'un prestige royal, d'une arrivee souveraine telle qu'aucune reine veritable n'a pu m'en donner l'impression dans la suite, parce que j'avais de leur pouvoir une notion moins vague et plus experimentale,--emportee par le vol de deux chevaux ardents, minces et contournes comme on en voit dans les dessins de Constantin Guys, portant etabli sur son siege un enorme cocher fourre comme un cosaque, a cote d'un petit groom rappelant le tigre de feu Baudenord, je voyais--ou plutot je sentais imprimer sa forme dans mon cur par une nette et epuisante blessure--une incomparable victoria, a dessein un peu haute et laissant passer a travers son luxe dernier cri des allusions aux formes anciennes, au fond de laquelle reposait avec abandon Mme Swann, ses cheveux maintenant blonds avec une seule meche grise ceints d'un mince bandeau de fleurs, le plus souvent des violettes, d'ou descendaient de longs voiles, a la main une ombrelle mauve, aux levres un sourire ambigu ou je ne voyais que la bienveillance d'une Majeste et ou il y avait surtout la provocation de la cocotte, et qu'elle inclinait avec douceur sur les personnes qui la saluaient. Ce sourire en realite disait aux uns: Je me rappelle tres bien, c'etait exquis! ; a d'autres: Comme j'aurais aime! c'a ete la mauvaise chance! ; a d'autres: Mais si vous voulez! Je vais suivre encore un moment la file et des que je pourrai, je couperai. Quand passaient des inconnus, elle laissait cependant autour de ses levres un sourire oisif, comme tourne vers l'attente ou le souvenir d'un ami et qui faisait dire: Comme elle est belle! Et pour certains hommes seulement elle avait un sourire aigre, contraint, timide et froid et qui signifiait: Oui, rosse, je sais que vous avez une langue de vipere, que vous ne pouvez pas vous tenir de parler! Est-ce que je m'occupe de vous, moi! Coquelin passait en discourant au milieu d'amis qui l'ecoutaient et faisait avec la main a des personnes en voiture, un large bonjour de theatre. Mais je ne pensais qu'a Mme Swann et je faisais semblant de ne pas l'avoir vue, car je savais qu'arrivee a la hauteur du Tir aux pigeons elle dirait a son cocher de couper la file et de l'arreter pour qu'elle put descendre l'allee a pied. Et les jours ou je me sentais le courage de passer a cote d'elle, j'entrainais Francoise dans cette direction. A un moment en effet, c'est dans l'allee des pietons, marchant vers nous que j'apercevais Mme Swann laissant s'etaler derriere elle la longue traine de sa robe mauve, vetue, comme le peuple imagine les reines, d'etoffes et de riches atours que les autres femmes ne portaient pas, abaissant parfois son regard sur le manche de son ombrelle, faisant peu attention aux personnes qui passaient, comme si sa grande affaire et son but avaient ete de prendre de l'exercice, sans penser qu'elle etait vue et que toutes les tetes etaient tournees vers elle. Parfois pourtant quand elle s'etait retournee pour appeler son levrier, elle jetait imperceptiblement un regard circulaire autour d'elle. Ceux meme qui ne la connaissaient pas etaient avertis par quelque chose de singulier et d'excessif--ou peut-etre par une radiation telepathique comme celles qui dechainaient des applaudissements dans la foule ignorante aux moments ou la Berma etait sublime,--que ce devait etre quelque personne connue. Ils se demandaient: Qui est-ce? , interrogeaient quelquefois un passant, ou se promettaient de se rappeler la toilette comme un point de repere pour des amis plus instruits qui les renseigneraient aussitot. D'autres promeneurs, s'arretant a demi, disaient: --Vous savez qui c'est? Mme Swann! Cela ne vous dit rien? Odette de Crecy? --Odette de Crecy? Mais je me disais aussi, ces yeux tristes... Mais savez-vous qu'elle ne doit plus etre de la premiere jeunesse! Je me rappelle que j'ai couche avec elle le jour de la demission de Mac-Mahon. --Je crois que vous ferez bien de ne pas le lui rappeler. Elle est maintenant Mme Swann, la femme d'un monsieur du Jockey, ami du prince de Galles. Elle est du reste encore superbe. --Oui, mais si vous l'aviez connue a ce moment-la, ce qu'elle etait jolie! Elle habitait un petit hotel tres etrange avec des chinoiseries. Je me rappelle que nous etions embetes par le bruit des crieurs de journaux, elle a fini par me faire lever. Sans entendre les reflexions, je percevais autour d'elle le murmure indistinct de la celebrite. Mon cur battait d'impatience quand je pensais qu'il allait se passer un instant encore avant que tous ces gens, au milieu desquels je remarquais avec desolation que n'etait pas un banquier mulatre par lequel je me sentais meprise, vissent le jeune homme inconnu auquel ils ne pretaient aucune attention, saluer (sans la connaitre, a vrai dire, mais je m'y croyais autorise parce que mes parents connaissaient son mari et que j'etais le camarade de sa fille), cette femme dont la reputation de beaute, d'inconduite et d'elegance etait universelle. Mais deja j'etais tout pres de Mme Swann, alors je lui tirais un si grand coup de chapeau, si etendu, si prolonge, qu'elle ne pouvait s'empecher de sourire. Des gens riaient. Quant a elle, elle ne m'avait jamais vu avec Gilberte, elle ne savait pas mon nom, mais j'etais pour elle--comme un des gardes du Bois, ou le batelier ou les canards du lac a qui elle jetait du pain--un des personnages secondaires, familiers, anonymes, aussi denues de caracteres individuels qu'un emploi de theatre, de ses promenades au bois. Certains jours ou je ne l'avais pas vue allee des Acacias, il m'arrivait de la rencontrer dans l'allee de la Reine-Marguerite ou vont les femmes qui cherchent a etre seules, ou a avoir l'air de chercher a l'etre; elle ne le restait pas longtemps, bientot rejointe par quelque ami, souvent coiffe d'un tube gris, que je ne connaissais pas et qui causait longuement avec elle, tandis que leurs deux voitures suivaient. Cette complexite du bois de Boulogne qui en fait un lieu factice et, dans le sens zoologique ou mythologique du mot, un Jardin, je l'ai retrouvee cette annee comme je le traversais pour aller a Trianon, un des premiers matins de ce mois de novembre ou, a Paris, dans les maisons, la proximite et la privation du spectacle de l'automne qui s'acheve si vite sans qu'on y assiste, donnent une nostalgie, une veritable fievre des feuilles mortes qui peut aller jusqu'a empecher de dormir. Dans ma chambre fermee, elles s'interposaient depuis un mois, evoquees par mon desir de les voir, entre ma pensee et n'importe quel objet auquel je m'appliquais, et tourbillonnaient comme ces taches jaunes qui parfois, quoi que nous regardions, dansent devant nos yeux. Et ce matin-la, n'entendant plus la pluie tomber comme les jours precedents, voyant le beau temps sourire aux coins des rideaux fermes comme aux coins d'une bouche close qui laisse echapper le secret de son bonheur, j'avais senti que ces feuilles jaunes, je pourrais les regarder traversees par la lumiere, dans leur supreme beaute; et ne pouvant pas davantage me tenir d'aller voir des arbres qu'autrefois, quand le vent soufflait trop fort dans ma cheminee, de partir pour le bord de la mer, j'etais sorti pour aller a Trianon, en passant par le bois de Boulogne. C'etait l'heure et c'etait la saison ou le Bois semble peut-etre le plus multiple, non seulement parce qu'il est plus subdivise, mais encore parce qu'il l'est autrement. Meme dans les parties decouvertes ou l'on embrasse un grand espace, ca et la, en face des sombres masses lointaines des arbres qui n'avaient pas de feuilles ou qui avaient encore leurs feuilles de l'ete, un double rang de marronniers oranges semblait, comme dans un tableau a peine commence, avoir seul encore ete peint par le decorateur qui n'aurait pas mis de couleur sur le reste, et tendait son allee en pleine lumiere pour la promenade episodique de personnages qui ne seraient ajoutes que plus tard. Plus loin, la ou toutes leurs feuilles vertes couvraient les arbres, un seul, petit, trapu, etete et tetu, secouait au vent une vilaine chevelure rouge. Ailleurs encore c'etait le premier eveil de ce mois de mai des feuilles, et celles d'un empelopsis merveilleux et souriant, comme une epine rose de l'hiver, depuis le matin meme etaient tout en fleur. Et le Bois avait l'aspect provisoire et factice d'une pepiniere ou d'un parc, ou soit dans un interet botanique, soit pour la preparation d'une fete, on vient d'installer, au milieu des arbres de sorte commune qui n'ont pas encore ete deplantes, deux ou trois especes precieuses aux feuillages fantastiques et qui semblent autour d'eux reserver du vide, donner de l'air, faire de la clarte. Ainsi c'etait la saison ou le Bois de Boulogne trahit le plus d'essences diverses et juxtapose le plus de parties distinctes en un assemblage composite. Et c'etait aussi l'heure. Dans les endroits ou les arbres gardaient encore leurs feuilles, ils semblaient subir une alteration de leur matiere a partir du point ou ils etaient touches par la lumiere du soleil, presque horizontale le matin comme elle le redeviendrait quelques heures plus tard au moment ou dans le crepuscule commencant, elle s'allume comme une lampe, projette a distance sur le feuillage un reflet artificiel et chaud, et fait flamber les supremes feuilles d'un arbre qui reste le candelabre incombustible et terne de son faite incendie. Ici, elle epaississait comme des briques, et, comme une jaune maconnerie persane a dessins bleus, cimentait grossierement contre le ciel les feuilles des marronniers, la au contraire les detachait de lui, vers",3.726502901401006,1.6260504740595734,0.34625962412269656,0.10514314472064883,4.666025641025641,4.0,2.6603690893652763,31.2,20.0,35.63593691766782,1.3102564102564103,1.0,0.6493763761052015,1560,678,0.4346153846153846,8304,50,23.61816597150772,18081695614.62461,9556921.572211739,0.7596394891033367,0.7473305134723583,64.3193076923077,12.039025641025642,10.962023055922355,14.890256410256411,16.146980769230765,10.687512820512818,54.661538461538456,7.32,True,43.0,0.8847780126849895,4.3890063424947146,1892.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.012846246487354477,0.005620232838217583,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.005018065034122842,0.003010839020473705,0.0,0.14323467230443976,98,book_proust_fr_swans-way_proust_original_segments.csv_metrics
"qui elles crispaient leurs doigts d'or. A mi-hauteur d'un arbre habille de vigne vierge, elle greffait et faisait epanouir, impossible a discerner nettement dans l'eblouissement, un immense bouquet comme de fleurs rouges, peut-etre une variete d'illet. Les differentes parties du Bois, mieux confondues l'ete dans l'epaisseur et la monotonie des verdures se trouvaient degagees. Des espaces plus eclaircis laissaient voir l'entree de presque toutes, ou bien un feuillage somptueux la designait comme une oriflamme. On distinguait, comme sur une carte en couleur, Armenonville, le Pre Catelan, Madrid, le Champ de courses, les bords du Lac. Par moments apparaissait quelque construction inutile, une fausse grotte, un moulin a qui les arbres en s'ecartant faisaient place ou qu'une pelouse portait en avant sur sa moelleuse plateforme. On sentait que le Bois n'etait pas qu'un bois, qu'il repondait a une destination etrangere a la vie de ses arbres, l'exaltation que j'eprouvais n'etait pas causee que par l'admiration de l'automne, mais par un desir. Grande source d'une joie que l'ame ressent d'abord sans en reconnaitre la cause, sans comprendre que rien au dehors ne la motive. Ainsi regardais-je les arbres avec une tendresse insatisfaite qui les depassait et se portait a mon insu vers ce chef-d'uvre des belles promeneuses qu'ils enferment chaque jour pendant quelques heures. J'allais vers l'allee des Acacias. Je traversais des futaies ou la lumiere du matin qui leur imposait des divisions nouvelles, emondait les arbres, mariait ensemble les tiges diverses et composait des bouquets. Elle attirait adroitement a elle deux arbres; s'aidant du ciseau puissant du rayon et de l'ombre, elle retranchait a chacun une moitie de son tronc et de ses branches, et, tressant ensemble les deux moities qui restaient, en faisait soit un seul pilier d'ombre, que delimitait l'ensoleillement d'alentour, soit un seul fantome de clarte dont un reseau d'ombre noire cernait le factice et tremblant contour. Quand un rayon de soleil dorait les plus hautes branches, elles semblaient, trempees d'une humidite etincelante, emerger seules de l'atmosphere liquide et couleur d'emeraude ou la futaie tout entiere etait plongee comme sous la mer. Car les arbres continuaient a vivre de leur vie propre et quand ils n'avaient plus de feuilles, elle brillait mieux sur le fourreau de velours vert qui enveloppait leurs troncs ou dans l'email blanc des spheres de gui qui etaient semees au faite des peupliers, rondes comme le soleil et la lune dans la Creation de Michel-Ange. Mais forces depuis tant d'annees par une sorte de greffe a vivre en commun avec la femme, ils m'evoquaient la dryade, la belle mondaine rapide et coloree qu'au passage ils couvrent de leurs branches et obligent a ressentir comme eux la puissance de la saison; ils me rappelaient le temps heureux de ma croyante jeunesse, quand je venais avidement aux lieux ou des chefs-d'uvre d'elegance feminine se realiseraient pour quelques instants entre les feuillages inconscients et complices. Mais la beaute que faisaient desirer les sapins et les acacias du bois de Boulogne, plus troublants en cela que les marronniers et les lilas de Trianon que j'allais voir, n'etait pas fixee en dehors de moi dans les souvenirs d'une epoque historique, dans des uvres d'art, dans un petit temple a l'amour au pied duquel s'amoncellent les feuilles palmees d'or. Je rejoignis les bords du Lac, j'allai jusqu'au Tir aux pigeons. L'idee de perfection que je portais en moi, je l'avais pretee alors a la hauteur d'une victoria, a la maigreur de ces chevaux furieux et legers comme des guepes, les yeux injectes de sang comme les cruels chevaux de Diomede, et que maintenant, pris d'un desir de revoir ce que j'avais aime, aussi ardent que celui qui me poussait bien des annees auparavant dans ces memes chemins, je voulais avoir de nouveau sous les yeux au moment ou l'enorme cocher de Mme Swann, surveille par un petit groom gros comme le poing et aussi enfantin que saint Georges, essayait de maitriser leurs ailes d'acier qui se debattaient effarouchees et palpitantes. Helas! il n'y avait plus que des automobiles conduites par des mecaniciens moustachus qu'accompagnaient de grands valets de pied. Je voulais tenir sous les yeux de mon corps pour savoir s'ils etaient aussi charmants que les voyaient les yeux de ma memoire, de petits chapeaux de femmes si bas qu'ils semblaient une simple couronne. Tous maintenant etaient immenses, couverts de fruits et de fleurs et d'oiseaux varies. Au lieu des belles robes dans lesquelles Mme Swann avait l'air d'une reine, des tuniques greco-saxonnes relevaient avec les plis des Tanagra, et quelquefois dans le style du Directoire, des chiffrons liberty semes de fleurs comme un papier peint. Sur la tete des messieurs qui auraient pu se promener avec Mme Swann dans l'allee de la Reine-Marguerite, je ne trouvais pas le chapeau gris d'autrefois, ni meme un autre. Ils sortaient nu-tete. Et toutes ces parties nouvelles du spectacle, je n'avais plus de croyance a y introduire pour leur donner la consistance, l'unite, l'existence; elles passaient eparses devant moi, au hasard, sans verite, ne contenant en elles aucune beaute que mes yeux eussent pu essayer comme autrefois de composer. C'etaient des femmes quelconques, en l'elegance desquelles je n'avais aucune foi et dont les toilettes me semblaient sans importance. Mais quand disparait une croyance, il lui survit--et de plus en plus vivace pour masquer le manque de la puissance que nous avons perdue de donner de la realite a des choses nouvelles--un attachement fetichiste aux anciennes qu'elle avait animees, comme si c'etait en elles et non en nous que le divin residait et si notre incredulite actuelle avait une cause contingente, la mort des Dieux. Quelle horreur! me disais-je: peut-on trouver ces automobiles elegantes comme etaient les anciens attelages? je suis sans doute deja trop vieux--mais je ne suis pas fait pour un monde ou les femmes s'entravent dans des robes qui ne sont pas meme en etoffe. A quoi bon venir sous ces arbres, si rien n'est plus de ce qui s'assemblait sous ces delicats feuillages rougissants, si la vulgarite et la folie ont remplace ce qu'ils encadraient d'exquis. Quelle horreur! Ma consolation c'est de penser aux femmes que j'ai connues, aujourd'hui qu'il n'y a plus d'elegance. Mais comment des gens qui contemplent ces horribles creatures sous leurs chapeaux couverts d'une voliere ou d'un potager, pourraient-ils meme sentir ce qu'il y avait de charmant a voir Mme Swann coiffee d'une simple capote mauve ou d'un petit chapeau que depassait une seule fleur d'iris toute droite. Aurais-je meme pu leur faire comprendre l'emotion que j'eprouvais par les matins d'hiver a rencontrer Mme Swann a pied, en paletot de loutre, coiffee d'un simple beret que depassaient deux couteaux de plumes de perdrix, mais autour de laquelle la tiedeur factice de son appartement etait evoquee, rien que par le bouquet de violettes qui s'ecrasait a son corsage et dont le fleurissement vivant et bleu en face du ciel gris, de l'air glace, des arbres aux branches nues, avait le meme charme de ne prendre la saison et le temps que comme un cadre, et de vivre dans une atmosphere humaine, dans l'atmosphere de cette femme, qu'avaient dans les vases et les jardinieres de son salon, pres du feu allume, devant le canape de soie, les fleurs qui regardaient par la fenetre close la neige tomber? D'ailleurs il ne m'eut pas suffi que les toilettes fussent les memes qu'en ces annees-la. A cause de la solidarite qu'ont entre elles les differentes parties d'un souvenir et que notre memoire maintient equilibrees dans un assemblage ou il ne nous est pas permis de rien distraire, ni refuser, j'aurais voulu pouvoir aller finir la journee chez une de ces femmes, devant une tasse de the, dans un appartement aux murs peints de couleurs sombres, comme etait encore celui de Mme Swann (l'annee d'apres celle ou se termine la premiere partie de ce recit) et ou luiraient les feux oranges, la rouge combustion, la flamme rose et blanche des chrysanthemes dans le crepuscule de novembre pendant des instants pareils a ceux ou (comme on le verra plus tard) je n'avais pas su decouvrir les plaisirs que je desirais. Mais maintenant, meme ne me conduisant a rien, ces instants me semblaient avoir eu eux-memes assez de charme. Je voudrais les retrouver tels que je me les rappelais. Helas! il n'y avait plus que des appartements Louis XVI tout blancs, emailles d'hortensias bleus. D'ailleurs, on ne revenait plus a Paris que tres tard. Mme Swann m'eut repondu d'un chateau qu'elle ne rentrerait qu'en fevrier, bien apres le temps des chrysanthemes, si je lui avais demande de reconstituer pour moi les elements de ce souvenir que je sentais attache a une annee lointaine, a un millesime vers lequel il ne m'etait pas permis de remonter, les elements de ce desir devenu lui-meme inaccessible comme le plaisir qu'il avait jadis vainement poursuivi. Et il m'eut fallu aussi que ce fussent les memes femmes, celles dont la toilette m'interessait parce que, au temps ou je croyais encore, mon imagination les avait individualisees et les avait pourvues d'une legende. Helas! dans l'avenue des Acacias--l'allee de Myrtes--j'en revis quelques-unes, vieilles, et qui n'etaient plus que les ombres terribles de ce qu'elles avaient ete, errant, cherchant desesperement on ne sait quoi dans les bosquets virgiliens. Elles avaient fui depuis longtemps que j'etais encore a interroger vainement les chemins desertes. Le soleil s'etait cache. La nature recommencait a regner sur le Bois d'ou s'etait envolee l'idee qu'il etait le Jardin elyseen de la Femme; au-dessus du moulin factice le vrai ciel etait gris; le vent ridait le Grand Lac de petites vaguelettes, comme un lac; de gros oiseaux parcouraient rapidement le Bois, comme un bois, et poussant des cris aigus se posaient l'un apres l'autre sur les grands chenes qui sous leur couronne druidique et avec une majeste dodoneenne semblaient proclamer le vide inhumain de la foret desaffectee, et m'aidaient a mieux comprendre la contradiction que c'est de chercher dans la realite les tableaux de la memoire, auxquels manquerait toujours le charme qui leur vient de la memoire meme et de n'etre pas percus par les sens. La realite que j'avais connue n'existait plus. Il suffisait que Mme Swann n'arrivat pas toute pareille au meme moment, pour que l'Avenue fut autre. Les lieux que nous avons connus n'appartiennent pas qu'au monde de l'espace ou nous les situons pour plus de facilite.
